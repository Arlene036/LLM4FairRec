an edge between node 0 and node 1 with weight 1,
an edge between node 0 and node 4 with weight 2,
an edge between node 0 and node 8 with weight 1,
an edge between node 0 and node 9 with weight 4,
an edge between node 1 and node 7 with weight 4,
an edge between node 1 and node 3 with weight 4,
an edge between node 1 and node 6 with weight 1,
an edge between node 1 and node 2 with weight 1,
an edge between node 1 and node 4 with weight 3,
an edge between node 1 and node 8 with weight 1,
an edge between node 1 and node 9 with weight 2,
an edge between node 2 and node 7 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 5 with weight 4,
an edge between node 2 and node 3 with weight 4,
an edge between node 2 and node 4 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 8 with weight 1,
