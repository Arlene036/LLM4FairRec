Answer should end with: So the maximum flow from node i to node j is #your answer#. where i and j are the source and sink nodes in the question.
In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 1 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 0 to node 2 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 0 to node 4 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 1 to node 3 with capacity 1,
an edge from node 2 to node 0 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 3 to node 2 with capacity 8,
an edge from node 3 to node 4 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 4 to node 2 with capacity 8,
an edge from node 4 to node 0 with capacity 10.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 2?
A:
Acc: 1/1
