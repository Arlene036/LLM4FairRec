       "['5247778::::Pyrex Oblong Roaster::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::17.09.2011::::    I was looking on the Asda web site for some information and discovered that they had the Pyrex rectangular roaster that I own for    5 http://www.dunelm-mill.com/shop/pyrex-rectangular-roaster-47720 has 1 for    3.99There   s a Dunelm in LutonI have owned the Pyrex roaster for many years now and have used it many, many times.This Pyrex roaster is made of clear glass with a high thermal shock resistance and can withstand heat up to 270 C I do not cook things that hot. Now this roaster is an oblong shape it has a lip either end which has grip ridges on. It measures 26cm/10 in long, 17cm /7in long it is not very deep at 6 cm/2 in. You can get this  in different sizes22 x 13 cm26 x 17 cm 30 x 30 cm35 x 23 cm39 x 25cm  I use mine in my gas oven, it is microwave safe as is all Pyrex but it   s too big for mine. When its cold and the contents wrapped you could put it in your freezer. I wash mine by hand but you can use a dishwasher (no dishwasher in my house except Hubby and me)This Pyrex dish is a thick durable glass   guaranteed for 10 years but I  expect mine to last me a life time. I have other Pyrex which was my mums and some I had as a wedding present.  This Pyrex glass rectangular roasting dish is stain resistant this I can say is true as mine has no stains.I use mine to cook roasts for cooking chops or sausages on, roast potatoes parsnips    and many other items I use it to make a large tray bake cake. I have used it to serve nibbles and salad on. This rectangular roaster is really versatile. It does not look out of place on the table so ideal for serving straight from the oven. Pyrex glass has been around for many years, the glass    For Pyrex ware was first produced by Germany for making light bulbs. In 1883   .In 1905 the American firm Corning was producing dishes using this glass. The name Pyrex was given to these products in 1915. Pyrex   products are very good. The shape and style of the oblong roaster makes it a very good addition to my kitchen cookware.     ::::6740155:3:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::5203100:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::5335750:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6751010:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6882156:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5362774:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6888281:4:::6888281:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Nozeroy (France)::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::16.09.2011::::    This summer while touring France we stayed in the Jura and visited the village of Nozeroy one day This town is an enchanting medieval old village we parked at one end and walked right through to the other. I was impressed with how clean and tidy this village was. I loved the old stone architecture; sadly I only have 1 photo to show you. However go to http://www.france-voyage.com/travel-guide/nozeroy-1101.htm and there are several photos to give you a feeling off the place. The village feels spacious. At other end of the village are two town gates one a gate inn a medieval tower which has a clock on it (this tower all that remains of a grand chateau). The grand rue runs between them. Some of the houses had small courtyards with a few flower displays   and hanging baskets but in  general these houses did not have gardens.   There are a couple of shops  the Vival general store s which is very small and hairdressers.  There is a bakery too.  There is a shop selling art items from wood , paintings, pottery and others made by local artisans.There are a few restaurants and hotels too.  Near the Vival shop was an old fountain and a pretty flower display The 15th century church looks very solid, we peeped inside it has stained glass windows and some columns rising to the roof it is an attractive church. Standing outside the church looking out  into the countryside I did notice what  looked like allotments for the villagers with no gardens. Strolling slightly out of the village we noticed what we guessed to be an old castle, however the ruins of this were boarded up work was going on to restore it. I believe there is very little of this castle left. We sat on a bench near the castle and looked at the view. Nozeroy is a hilltop village and the view was lovely, in fact we walked all around this village and the views to all sides were magnificent. Nozeroy is in the Lons-le-Saunier, Jura, Franche-Comte, France, its geographical coordinates are 46    47  0 quot; North, 6    2  0 quot; East according to the RAC route finder it is 423.44 miles from Calais and takes 6h 19m 29s adding extra time for stops it took us in reality about 8 hours from Calais to our campsite about 15 miles away from here It is quite near Luxembourg too.  The nearest airport is at Geneve.If you were planning to stay in self catering here  camping or  cottage then you would be well advised to buy food before you get here  A fairly large town with small supermarkets is Champagnole about 15k away. . The roads in this area are skinny bendy and hilly  it does  take a long time to get anywhere.f you are in the area I certainly would recommend a visit. Although we visited in August  it was very quiet    not many visitors or locals . The population is  ,I believe under 500 people. This village is only small covering an area of 3.74km     ::::5258003:2:::5258003:2:::6900048:3:::6900048:3:::5719918:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6239059:3:::5261772:3:::6893330:3:::6893330:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6044343:3:::6044343:3:::6900073:3:::6900073:3:::6751010:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6723241:3:::6818102:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6603737:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6898018:4:::6805406:4:::5335750:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6880889:4:::6866291:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Red UK Cabbage::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::17.09.2011::::    I sometimes buy a red cabbage from Tesco. These red cabbages can be found in the fruit and veg aisles The red cabbages are prewrapped closely in plastic.At the moment they cost 64p for a cabbage weighing approx 650g the cabbages are sold as an entirety not by weight.This red cabbage is a British one (little union jack on the label), this is the season for red cabbage. I prefer to buy seasonal goods It upsets me to find so much of supermarket  fruit veg  comes from abroad I found only 1  British apple  in the aisle this week  when it is  the time that so many British apples are  ripe.   I choose the cabbage there really was not much difference in size or colour they are all that dark maroon red between them and they all looked similar. Tesco and all red cabbages are roundHaving got my red cabbage home I took the plastic wrapper off and   put the cabbage in the bottom of the fridge to  use a couple of days later. This red cabbage keeps well for a week.*Looks I took the cabbage out of the fridge when I wanted to use it and cut it in half. The leaves of the cabbage are very tightly packed together. I think it looks very attractive when cut in half with its red maroon coloured leaves its white stem core and the tracing of white from veins in the leaves.*PreparationI chopped as much cabbage as I needed for the recipe I was doing that day. 1 red cabbage will serve between 4 and 6 people. . I washed the cabbage thoroughly, this was not an organic red cabbage and I do not like eating residue of pesticide sprays.*Basic cooking  This cabbage is easy to cook as a simple vegetable.  To go with any meal Just boil a pan of water add salt if you wish then add the chopped red cabbage boil for about 4 minutes. Check it   s cooked to your satisfaction .Red cabbage should still have a bite texture not go too soggy.*Smell Yes it smells of cabbage   that pungent bad fart smell.*Cooked colourIf you look at the water a lot of the colour has leached out of the cabbage and is a blue red colour. The leaves are also a blue red colour, if you add vinegar the leaves turn back to red purple. *TasteRed cabbage does taste much like green cabbage but a bit stronger cabbage   taste.*NutritionTwice the vat C of green cabbage  Low in Saturated Fat and Cholesterol it   s a good source of iron. There is research to say it helps prevent cancer.Good for the diet too only 21 cal per 100g *My favourite recipes using Tesco red cabbage I like my red cabbage in a recipe with apples and bacon (I have cooked with good pork sausage instead of bacon sometimes.). I fry onions and bacon in the base of a pan with olive oil. Then I sometimes add garlic sometimes fennel seeds, it all depends on what I have. I then add  a chopped apple  season with salt vinegar and a  little balsamic or cider vinegar  I continue to cook it either on the hob if I can  keep an eye on it or I transfer it to a casserole dish and cook in the oven takes about  45  minutes to an  hour . The resulting dish is lovely does not taste too vinegary (I am not keen on vinegar)  There are similar recipes on line at http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/other-recipes/must-try-red-cabbage or http://uktv.co.uk/food/search/q/red 20cabbage.  I think Tesco red cabbage goes very well with a bacon joint or pork chops it goes well with pheasant and duck and other game.To make a coleslaw salad look more interesting I have sometimes added some red cabbage to the green I am satisfied with the red cabbage I get from Tesco it is of a good quality. Be warned too much red cabbage (like other cabbages) will make you have many botty pops         ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5261772:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6818102:4:::6239059:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5203100:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5790028:4:::6805327:4:::6805327:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6841809:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Chesil Beach, Weymouth::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::15.09.2011::::    Chesil BeachI have been on Chesil beach several times and find it fascinating. Chesil beach is in Dorset. It is fairly near Weymouth. Chesil beach is a beach 28k/18 miles long; it stretches from West Bay to Portland.  It is recognised as a place of specials scientific interest.This beach is not a sandy beach it is a shingle and pebble beach. Walking along the beach listen to the sound of the waves sifting through the pebbles. The beach is not connected to the land all the way but has al lagoon between it and the coast this lagoon is called the fleet. The beach is a narrow strip no more than 200metres in width. The beach is not flat it rises a few metres and has a shelf effect where the tide comes in. It is a ridge of shingle.Walking on the beach / shingle is not easy best to wear shoes.    Not open ones else small pieces of shingle get in and are painful. Chesil beach is not all tiny pieces of shingle some are quite large. The shingle is smaller in the west and larger near Portland. Some fossils can be found in certain areas of the beach.  More fossils found near Lyme Regis.I love walking along beaches picking up smooth shaped pebbles and fossil hunting. I love to find flat pebbles I can skim across the sea. I found quite a few suitable flat skimming pebbles along Chesil beach. I can remember waling on Chesil beach one evening and getting an amazing sunset.Chesil beach is quite exposed and can get very windy at times. -Access.There are several car parks next to the beach the ones I have used are the one at Abbotsbury Where there are the dragon   s teeth, these are the remains of anti tank defences where the beach   joins the mainland We also parked once at the Chesil beach car park by a visitors centre. I believe this centre is going to be refurbished and updated next year. There is also a car park at West Bexinton where you can also access the beach.@Why this shingle spit is a SSSI. Chesil beach particularly the Fleet is very rich in wildlife, lots of aquatic plant species. Many birds visit and nest in this area so good for birdwatchers, hubby is the bird watcher in our family not me really.   Website for more information is   http://www.chesilbeach.org/Chesil/index.htmlWould I recommend? Yes it makes a good excursion from Weymouth, but not really for making sandcastles     ::::6239059:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5719918:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6818102:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6699566:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6887858:4:::5285637:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::5362774:4:::6751010:4:::6840580:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Mackays Seedless Bramble Preserve::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::15.09.2011::::    I really like seedless blackberry preserves. I think a lot of this relates to my childhood in the late 50   s early 60   s. Living in the countryside   every year   we would go blackberry picking as an extended family group. Mum would spend ages making blackberry  jelly as we called it Straining the blackberry and sugar pulp through an old pair of tights  The purple jelly that was collected and poured into jam pots was wonderful especially on toast. lt; PriceAnyway enough of my childhood memories. Now to tell you about this Mackay   s Seedless Bramble Preserve. I bought some in Tesco a few weeks ago  I looked online today to check prices for this review and sadly it is now out of stock . A 340G jar cost me    1.49 that   s (43.8p / 100g). lt; PACKAGINGThis   preserve is in a glass jar with a gold lid this lid comes off with a twist. The label with a picture of blackberries gives all the nutritional information. lt; Ingredients  Blackberries sugar lemon juice, pectin. (I do remember mum having problems sometimes with her blackberry jelly setting, she sometimes used lemon juice to help it set.) lt;Nutrition The label says this preserve is made in open traditional copper bottomed pans.  There is 35g fruit to 65g sugar, I remember mum measuring equal amounts of fruit and sugar so hers higher in fruit.There are 266 kcal per 100g. lt;Colour As expected the preserve is a dark purple colour.  lt;consistencyI put my knife it to get some preserve it is a thick gel not runny. The gel stays on my knife until I tip it to spread. There is no evidence of pips that I can see. When I taste the preserve it is smooth no pips. (I used to hate it when mum made jam not jelly out off blackberries the pips got stuck in my teeth) The Blackberry preserve spreads well on my toast or bread. lt;Taste This MacKays blackberry preserve tastes good it does taste of blackberries and it   s very sweet. (No it   s not as nice as my mums home made)However I do think it has as MacKay   s claim that home made taste lt;Use  Well as I said I love this on warm toast or   in a jam sandwich. It would also be a treat on a hot buttered crumpet. (Not had it on a crumpet since I was a child) I also have used this blackberry preserve to make jam tarts with a spare piece off pastry. I have put it in the base of a dish and then put sponge cake mix on top and cooked it for a jammy sponge lt;MackaysMacKay   s  is a Scottish concern started in  1938 by the Mackay brothers,  The business sold in 1995 by father and son Paul and Martin Grant They produce many marmalades and  fruit preserves and jams.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Honeydew Melon Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::14.09.2011::::    I sometimes buy a honey dew melon and it   s usually from Tesco   s I usually shop there its easier. Honeydew melons cost    1.97 at Tesco this week 2 for    3.00 until the 18th sept. For my needs buying 2 would be too many I would not eat it all.Tesco also sell a value   honey dew melon too. I find the honey dew melon   s in the fruit aisle.  The yellow oval  rugby ball shaped melon has a smooth or slightly grooved skin. The melons in Tesco are usually about the same size as each other not much different. I usually pick up 2 or 3 before deciding. I choose completely yellow ones with no green on them which one I will buy?  I lightly squeeze the ends of the melons and if they are slightly soft this means they are ripe. I feel a bit self conscious doing this but if I want a ripe melon that night for guests I will sniff the melon too ripe fruits smell unripe ones do not.I take my melon along with the rest of the shopping to the till. No weighing melons are sold as an entirety not by weight.  Having got my Tesco melon home I leave it on the table till we eat some later that night.  Honey dew melons from Tesco will keep for several days. I get a sharp knife to cut the melon into segments only cutting as much as I need the rest goes covered up into the fridge wrapped in cling film. A segment about a 1/8tyh of the melon is enough for one serving.  When cut open the melon has a green tinged  flesh and lots of flat oval seeds in the centre , these I cut our but you can eat them. This melon tastes sweet (especially if you get a ripe one) and fresh. I will often have a slice just as it is. If I am serving as a starter I may serve cubes of melon   with slices of Serrano ham using a cocktail stick to join the ham and melon. I have used Parma ham with melon too.I also make a fresh fruit salad and add cubes of melon. I have attempted making melon balls   using a spoon and then an ice-cream scoop, they were not ever so sucessful in shape    I needed a proper melon baler.

       " '5247778::::The Harlequin Centre, Watford::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::12.09.2011::::    The Harlequin Centre, WatfordThe Harlequin shopping centre at Watford is coming of age this year it is 21 years this September since its doors first opened. I live about 35 minutes away by car and have shopped there many, many times. The Harlequin is an indoor shopping centre on 2 floors with 140 shops.  To find out which shops are there go to http://www.the-harlequin-watford.co.uk/Shopping there are more than enough shops to spend all my money in@ Getting thereI could catch the bus to Watford from near my home but it does take a long, long time. I notice many buses go into Watford from many different places. Watford is also on the train line with virgin trains running   to/from London to/from Manchester stopping many places between. So by car I go.@Parking. Hubby (I can not drive) usually parks in Tesco car park as we usually need a few things from Tesco   s when we go shopping into Watford. You can park at Tesco for 3 hours free and that is enough time for a shop in the town and a quick supermarket dash. There are 3 car parks at the harlequin centre Kings, Queens and Palace. There are a few other car parks within walking distance of the shops too. If we are using the shopping centre car parks we usually   park at Kings or queens.@Opening times The Harlequin shopping centre opens at 9am   Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday and Saturday on Sunday it opens at11am. It closes at 18oo Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday Friday. Thursday is late night closing at 21.00 On Saturday it closes at 1000 on Sunday early closing at 1700.@Access into the heart of the Harlequin. I usually enter the shopping centre via Boots shop entrance door. It is possible to enter the Harlequin from the lower high street, from Charter place or Queens   s road.  There are several shops including Marks and Sparks and BHS which you can gain access to in the street and then walk through to the centre of the shopping centre. @ Toilets. Because I usually have a cup of tea before I leave home almost the first thing I need when shopping is the toilets.  There are toilets   on the lower ground floor near Boots next to Zara so these are often my first port of call. These toilets are usually quite clean and tidy. There is a disabled toilet here and a cubicle for mother and child a bit bigger than standard toilets, gent   s toilets here too.On the upper floor toilets can be found next to Schuh and yours on the way out to parking. Several of the shops also have toilet facilities too.@ Shopping. That   s the reason I go to Watford Going through Boots I might buy some make up or beauty kit as a gift for someone. There is an optician in this Boots store too.Now into the Lower Mall, it   s quite spacious and cleans no rubbish lying around.  I try and go early Saturday or in the week holiday times as I do not like shopping when it is busy. There is quite a good range of shops in the Harlequin a good John Lewis   s   and other department stores such as BHS there is a Marks and Sparks too.  There are many shoe shops Dune, Clarks, Shuh, Barrat   s and several other shoe shops. Then there is a Next and many other of the shops which to be honest you find at most other shopping centres throughout Britain.The shops generally seem to be fairly well stocked better than my very small town shop   s.@ Lower Mall.I usually walk through the lower mall shopping first then   going outside briefly crossing Queens   s road over to the other side of the shopping centre. To   Hawkins bazaar and BHS. I sometimes pop into the market area. @Upper Mall. I go up the elevator to the upper mall. Here I might do some more shopping Next is here and the Disney store walk straight on over the bridge above Queens Road (you would not know it was a bridge really) continue shopping. Then   going down the escalator or the lift at the end of the upper mall I retrace my footsteps loaded with my purchases back to the car.   @ Refreshments There are several places you can stop for refreshment Costa coffee   Starbucks John Lewis has a restaurant as does BHS. In the centre of the lower concourse is Yog. There used to be a fairly large refreshment area here. There are a few benches and a pot plant or two in this wider concourse area.Santa will of course be in the centre concourse in a few weeks time.Would I recommend shopping in Watford? That   s a difficult one. Watford Harlequin is much like any indoor shopping centre, almost the same shops. So probably not worth travelling vast distances. But if you live fairly locally and it   s an easy large shopping centre to get to then yes I would recommend it. One advantage is it   s indoor so you do not get wet if it   s raining while shopping.The category picture is of the outside of the harlequin and one of the entrances     ::::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6723241:3:::6239059:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::6218348:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5719918:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6841809:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::5335750:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::3957:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::6866291:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6840580:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6751010:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Baking Potatoes::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::12.09.2011::::    I wanted some baking potatoes for lunch at the weekend so when in Tesco on Friday I bought 2.5kg prewrapped prewieghed British baking potatoes in a plastic see through bag. This bag has a   union jack picture on it. :PriceThe price for a 2.5kg  bag is    1.78  that   s 71.2p / Kg a bag of baking potatoes  weighing 1.5kg cost    1.25 working out at 83p per  kilo buying Tesco   s baking potatoes loose costs    1.25 a kilo.   The label said these were a Sapphire variety Sapphire potatoes are known for having a fairly large crop of good sized potatoes.: Quantity, size, shapeI used some of the potatoes at the weekend and when I opened the bag I counted them there were 12 potatoes I expect the number per bag will vary depending on the weight of each individual potato.  Each potato worked out at about 15p each. The potatoes were a reasonable size to use for a baked potato lunch the one I measures was about 10cm by 7 cm. The potatoes are a white one an oval shape. :Cleaning.The potatoes were quite clean no soil sticking on them a few eyes any blemishes. I always wash and scrub my potatoes I have a small potato scrubbing brush to get all soil and dirt off. :CookingI have a microwave and sometimes cook a baking potato in it for an easy meal after work.  Cooking this way a potato takes about 8 minutes depending on size.I prefer to cook mine in the oven it gives a crispy skin. I stab the skins of these Tesco basking potatoes (stops them exploding) rub a little oil over them and sprinkle salt over them, this makes the skin delicious and crispy. I have some potato prongs  ,  4 metal spikes which I insert into the potato this does speed cooking as the meal conducts heat into the centre of the potato. If cooking without   potato prongs they need longer.  I switch my oven up hot 200c and bake for about an hour  up to 2 hours  depending on size and if I use my potato prong.These Tesco baking potatoes bake well the potato white and fluffy inside. :Taste and eating. They taste good a nice flavour, not earthy, not bitter.I like to put butter into my baked potatoes then there are many fillings I use. I love grated cheese in a baked potato, or tuna, or baked beans, good with chilli.See http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A738687 for ideas.for filling baked potatoesA baked potato made from Tesco potatoes makes an ideal lunch or super. Ideal for serving with a meal no peeling required. I sometimes just peel and boil my Tesco baking potatoes  they make a good mashed potato.:Recommendation  So would I recommend these potatoes? Yes they are a good baking potato nice and fluffy and a good flavour. Makes a fairly cheap meal too.      ::::6699566:3:::6625623:3:::6625623:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6879236:3:::6879236:3:::6829585:3:::6836599:3:::5261772:4:::6239059:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::3957:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6880805:4:::6841809:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6218348:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5971856:4:::5971856:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5719918:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6890749:4:::6890749:4:::6657747:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6800944:4:::5335750:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6866291:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5338981:4:::5338981:4:::6898018:4:::6894652:4:::6882156:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6840580:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Fusilli Pasta Twists::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.09.2011::::    Tesco Fusilli Pasta TwistsLast week for some reason unknown to me I bought a packet of Tesco Fusilli Pasta Twists; I usually buy Tesco value penne pasta. *PriceI usually buy Tesco value penne pasta   in a 500g bag for 41p (82 per 1kg) I find this pasta good for any pasta dish. Tesco Fusilli Pasta Twists are more expensive at 89p for a 500g bag (1.78 per kg) bag I bought a 1kg for    1.18; a 3 kg bag costs    3.25(   1.09/kg.There are many makes shapes and sizes of pasta on the shelves at Tesco bows, shells, twists, and penne. Napolina Fusilli (twists) Pasta 1Kg costs    2.19 for 1kg these are on offer this week 2 for    3.00.Ingredients.This pasta is made from Durum wheat semolina and contains gluten. Packaging.  The pasta twists are in a polypropylene /plastic bag this has blue ends   transparent windows and a cream information banner saying it is Authentic Italian Fusilli and giving nutritional information.Opening and storing When I open the bag  which is fairly easy  I cut mine with a  knife ,or scissors I take  out the amount that I am using that day then  empty the rest into a storage jar (I have old plastic sweetie jars that I got free from a local  shop) I could try to keep it in the original bag if I seal it somehow , however I do not find that this usually works  I get loose pasta in my cupboards if I try.*QuantityI rarely weigh my pasta but generally 3-4 oz/75-115g is sufficient per person * Cooking  I place the pasta in a saucepan pour in enough boiling water to cover and cook for 10-12 minutes. It   s really simple to cook. Just add a little oil to stop it sticking together.After it is ready I strain it in a colander and run some boiling water over it to remove the gloopy starch.*Use I have made several dishes with this fusilli pasta, pasta salads, and used it with a Bolognese sauce and a cheese sauce.There are many recipes on line for pasta salads see http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/pasta_salad for some. I tend to make my own up depending on what I have in the store cupboard.  I usually add tomatoes peas, sometimes sweet corn, olives, may be feta cheese or some sort of cold meat a dash of olive oil and a squeeze or a   squirt of lemon juice. I serve it hot serving a cheese or a tomato or Bolognese sauce with it. There are many recipes at http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/pasta/pasta-sauces/main.aspx*Calories  There are 355 kcal per 100g so about 270 kcal per 75g serving.*Texture. Hard when not cooked, soft when cooked do not over cook or it goes too soggy. Should still be just that little bit chewy /firm / a la dente. It is smooth, no fibres. *Taste Very similar to Tesco value pasta. It is a plain mild taste children should like. When cooked it has lost that flour taste.*SmellThere is not a great deal of smell to Tesco Fusilli pasta twists, they smell a bit flour like * RecommendationWould I recommend / Yes. Tesco fusilli / Spirals are good.*Learning through PlayAnother use of these Pasta spirals would be for sensory play in a nursery/ play group or for special needs children.This Tesco fusili pasta can be used dry for play. Your child will feel the texture hard; will feel the shape running their fingers around the spiral. This basic play  will help build brain connections .Moving their hands and arms through the pasta will help develop gross motor  control, picking up individual  twists of pasta, and scooping and pouring spoonfuls of pasta  help develop fine motor movements.Early maths and science skills will be learnt through pasta play. Give your child a few tools pots and spoons. They will scoop pasta and fill pots learning full, empty measuring, counting. Give your child some cooked spirals to play with and the experience will be different .Its an opportunity to compare to talk about the changes between cooked uncooked, dry, wet.  Introduce e words into your child   s language full, empty soft hard. . Use your imagination and play with your children  These spirals can be used for a children   s art activity too. Get your child to stick them onto paper or card with PVA glue. The pasta spirals can be painted.Yet another use for child play makes a shaker with them. A visual and sound shaker can be made by putting Tesco fusilli pasta (or any other) into a clean dry empty   squash/lemonade bottle screw the lid on shake rattle and roll.If you are interested in sensory play I found this website explaing it .http://play-activities.com/blog/sensory-play- E2 80 93-part-1- E2 80 93-introduction-what-is-sensory-play/ Thanks for reading about Tesco fusilli pasta and the uses I put it too     ::::6239059:4:::5261772:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6740155:4:::6755322:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5719918:4:::6800944:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6840580:4:::5335750:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6757811:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5347743:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6890814:4:::6838363:4:::6838363:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6879769:4:::6879769:4:::6894652:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6699566:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::The Walter Rothschild Zoological, Museum, Tring::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::10.09.2011::::    The Lionel Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum Is now called the Natural History museum at Tring. The museum changed its name in 2007. This museum used to belong to the Rothschild   s family it was the private museum of Lionel  Walter Rothschild the 2nd Baron. The Rothschild   s owned a lot off the land and properties around Tring. The museum was created in 1889 and was opened to the public in 1892 it   was gifted to the Trustees of the British Museum in 1936.Rothschild had studied zoology at Cambridge, he travelled europe and Africa collecting  specimens of many animal species, he also employed others to collect specimens from all over the world .These specimens were preserved stuffed and mounted for his museum.Yes this is a museum full of dead animals, but do not let that put you off.  (Comment by  my grandson aged 6  when seeing a picture of  Lionel William Rothschild  quot;Was that the man who killed and stuffed all the animals? quot; when told yes  he asked if he was dead, when told  yes  then grandson replied I am glad he was nasty to kill all those animals)We  explained that a long time ago people  collected and killed  animals as they could not take pictures easily and that some of the animals were used  for research . It was difficult to explain to a 6 year old.This museum is on Akeman Street Tring Hertfordshire. Tring is about 40 minutes by train from London Euston.  The station is about 2 miles from Tring and the museum.  There is a bus service or taxi   s are available if you do not fancy the walk  Location maps at http://www.yell.com/b/The+Natural+History+Museum-Museums-Tring-HP236 AP-3840706/index.html and http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q hl=en geocode= q=HP23 206APIf you come by car there is some parking by the side of the museum. The museum is quite an attractive old Victorian building.The museum is open 10.00am-5.00pm Monday-Saturday and 2-5pm on SundaysThe museum and the car park are free. Some events may have a small charge.Although the entrance at Akeman Street has steps unsuitable for disabled aces there are 2 other entrances one  on Park street and one  by the car park  Here there is  now a lift entrance The lift was only installed last year . If you are disabled there is a unisex   toilet on the first floor which is suitable.Now do you need the toilet before we go in children? The access to the toilets is in the car park.   Now come on up the steps with me to the door. Where you go into the reception where you can buy a guide book. The guide book is good giving detail and a floor plan. There are activity sheets for children these costs 50p. You can borrow   clip boards pencils and paper free. The floor plan and most of the exhibits have not changed much since I started visiting this museum year s ago.Turn right if you want to leave pushchairs, coats, or your picnic lunch. Turn left to go straight into the exhibits.. We enter into gallery 1 where we are met with a huge smiling polar bear. (He has been greeting visitors for years)Gallery 1 exhibits Birds, large carnivores and primates There are two rows of tall wooden framed glass fronted cases. Inside these glass casers are many stuffed and preserved animals. A huge gorilla is standing next to a human skeleton you can compare the similarities. A lion lounges looking at you through the glass. In another   glass case resides the bird of paradise and many other familiar and not so familiar birds. I believe there are examples of all the UK breeding birds On the top of these tall exhibition cases is a huge Elephant and 2 rhinosThrough the doorway at the other end of gallery 1 leads to gallery 2 where you will find the temporary exhibitions. At the moment it is The Secret World of Museum Science. In December there is a display of photographs from the Veolia Environement Wildlife Photographer of the Year.Many talks are hosted at the museum and there are many events for children, the summer season is just finishing and there are activity days making spider hats, finger puppets    or juicing apples in October. Look on line for details of these and other activities at http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources-rx/files/ds3486-tring-whats-on-oct_ Now let   s go back through gallery 1 past the monkeys and les visit the discovery room the other side of the stairs, actually with children it might be best to visit this last as it   s by the shopThe discovery room is actually on two levels the ground level contains fossils, skins shells sponges and magnifying glasses to investigate these items. Up a flight of stairs and to the first floor discovery room her there is an activity sheet for children to fill in to find out about themselves. How many beans can you hold in one hand, are you a tongue curler? Next to this discovery room is the Rothschild room this room looks like a Victorian office with leather chairs and desks, that the original curators, and Rothschild, may have worked in.  There is information about the Rothschild   s and the original curators. There are some of the cassowaries which roamed Tring Park in Walter Rothschild   s time Cassowaries are flightless birds. There is   a giant tortoise here as well this was given to Rothschild in 18 15 it lived till 18 17Personally I do not go into the discovery rooms and the Rothschild room first but go up the main staircase. There is a lift for disabled people just ask the staff. Up the grand stairway to gallery 3. This is immediately above gallery 1. The centre is dominated by the 2 rhino   s and the Elephant. Fish and marine animals are in cabinets around the edge of this gallery. At either end of the centre of this gallery are cabinets to open and look in    .. Inside these small cabinets are creepy crawlies and bugs. Even though I am not scared of creepy crawlies I must admit I would not like to meet some of these on a dark night  Go through the doorway at the other end of this gallery to a smaller gallery number 4. In here are the horses and Zebras. (Lionel Walter Rothschild was I think an eccentric he trained and drove a carriage pulled by 4 Zebras)  Now up the steps to gallery 5. There is often a display stand here as well as the cabinets. Here the deer and the antelope stand, there   s a pig too, A large bison with his woolly coat. Several of the animals displayed here are endangered species. Turn the corner at the end into gallery 6 . This gallery is one that has been updated fairly recently. This gallery houses   domestic dogs, all stuffed for you to compare. There is also a stuffed fat dormouse/Glis Glis (The dormouse was first introduced to tring by Walter Rothschild in 1902 as an edible delicacy they somehow escaped and now can be found in and around Tring. They can be a nuscence gnawing through electric cables. These Dormice are not often seen though, Hubby said he has seen dead ones he thinks they are nocturnal) A display my daughter used to love when she was tiny was the harvest mice in a small case with some wheat. A badger stands in this gallery and you can stroke and feel him. (We see   several dead badgers each year on the roads around Tring) I am not sure if they are still there as I have not looked at them recently but  one of the cases holds  two fleas dressed as Mexican dancers In gallery 6 there is also an interactive touch-screen where you can watch a video showing an animal being prepared for display there is info about the museums beginnings here too.From here I will go back through gallery 5 and then maybe look in the Rothschild room   and to the discovery room and then the grandchildren somehow lure me into the shop on the ground floor there are many souvenirs and books that can be bought here. Fancy a cup of tea and a cake or maybe a sandwich before you go home? Then pop into the small Zebra caf    ice creams are available here too, soup in the winter.If you take your own sandwiches you can eat them in a picnic area in Park Street or alternatively walk into Tring Park behind the museum over the A 41 for a picnic Map http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8 g=London,+Middlesex,+EC1R+0LU source=embed oe=UTF8 msa=0 msid=113913154035864035022.00045bf9088c4a2bbec6eAbout Tring Parkhttp://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/our-woods/Pages/wood-details.aspx?wood=4675The Tring  Natural History museum is a good place to go if you are interested in Animals it is ideal to go with children. Many schools will visit here.  I have visited many times it is a popular place to visit with guests if the weather is wet. Although only a small museum it can be tiring walking around, due to all the stairs and steps. There are many. Many exhibits stored in   this compact museum for you to look at. If you are visiting or living in Herts, or Bucks I would recommend visiting. Even visiting from further afield if you are interested. Certainly there are lots of other   places of interest nearby to make it worth while coming to Tring.Web site  http://www.nhm.ac.uk/tring/visiting     ::::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552133:4:::5552133:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6880805:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6701923:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6890814:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5719918:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6603737:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6699566:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5335750:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6899045:5:::6899045:5:::6840624:5:::6840624:5:::6889871:5:::6889871:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Turkish Coast: Kas to Dalyan - Michael Bussmann::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::31.08.2011::::    This review is one I published on Amazon .Turkish coast Kas to Dalyan sunflower complete guideI have often used the Sunflower guides and a couple of years ago when we went to Turkey we used this one. At Easter we are due to visit Kas and the surrounding area so I have been reading this book again.I have found this book easy to read, with the information clearly set out. At 210 x1150 x12 mm it   s a reasonable size easy to put in a rucksack pocket.  This book includes information about travelling to and around the area. The description about the driving in this area is quite accurate driving with caution is recommended remember to sound your horn before going round a blind bend to make oncoming traffic aware of you.  There is a chapter about walking. About the best times to walk, about maps, tips about nuisances, dogs, snakes and ticks and about equipment you might need.There a chapter on where to stay hotels, guest houses, aparthotels, campsites giving you an idea what to expect. Food and drink is described the type of place to eat and rough prices, about the types of food /meals available.The book goes on to describe 16 walks in good detail. These are from various places on the coast from Demre (east of Kas) west to Dalyan. We have walked some of these walks and as with other walks from the Sunflower series it is always good to have an expectation that you may get lost. Without the book we would have had very little idea where to walk.The descriptions of the walk are quite detailed with reference to natural features but its not always easy to follow instructions like:- The path continues over stony ground then drops down to a huge plane tree by a  stream. Or pass some old terracing and come to an old olive tree. Then the path drops to a track follow this round the hillside.  There are lots of olive trees which one does it mean? The old olive tree may have been bulldozed down and a new track made.  All the ground is stony.  We have successfully completed walks working out what the directions are saying.There is an address in the book so that readers can tell the authors of any changes they encounter and those changes are added to new publications of the book.A new publication of this edition is expected soon. There are sections on all of the main towns and the archaeology in this area giving adequate descriptions.There is a fold out map in the back of the book which has all the towns and main roads marked on it shows rivers and has a code that marks where the walks are that the book describes.This book really gives information you need about visiting this area its customs and law; about what to expect from hotels and eateries, information about the towns and about the walking and the wildlife. There is good information about the ancient sites and the beaches which ones are sandy and which are rocky. Yes I would recommend this book of the region This is a paperback edition but I think also available as hard back .

       " '5247778::::Tesco White Seedless Grapes Loose Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::08.09.2011::::    Tesco White Seedless Grapes LooseI  often buy grapes especially if the grandchildren are visiting  .I usually buy  my grapes from Tesco Sometimes red grapes sometimes green/white, always seedless as the pips  give  me the pip.This week I notice Tesco self serve green grapes are    3.47  a kilo, Asda price is the same, Ocado are more expensive at    5.58 a kiloSainsbury   s seedless white grapes are    4.00 a kilo. Tesco white seedless grapes are available in the fruit and vegetable area of the supermarket. They are presented already in plastic bags , these plastic bags  can be sealed at the top. Each plastic bag has bunches of grapes weighing approximately 650g in it. I look to see a bag which contains about the amount of grapes that I want. Then I look to check the grapes are in good condition. I do not want to buy that manky brown or mouldy grape. I have been known to remove bad grapes from a bunch. I look for a bunch with unblemished plump grapes I do not want wrinkled ones.Some times the first few bags I pick up have a brown grape in them.I have found them no better or worse than other supermarkets green seedless grapes.You can weigh the grapes yourself in the vegetable and fruit area or wait till you get to the till where they will be weighed and priced anyway.I always make sure the grapes are near the top of my shopping to transport home as I do not want squashed grapes.Depending on how soon I want the grapes I either put them straight in the fridge unwashed, washing will make them decay quicker. I always wash them before eating as they probably were treated with insecticide while growing. The grapes I store like this will keep   about 6 days. Alternatively if I know they will be eaten with in a day or two, when I get these grapes home I always wash them and then dabbing them dry letting them drain on to kitchen roll before putting in my fruit dish. The grapes I keep this way will keep about 3 days then shrivel and begin to ferment.Green seedless grapes from Tesco are oval shaped usually quite plump and taste sweet, slightly sourer than red grapes I think. They are quite juicy the flesh soft yet firm.  They smell fresh and fruity.I use grapes as a sweet fruit snack nibble anytime I feel hungry. I will sometimes have a couple of grapes with cheese and biscuits ideal like this after a meal with friends. I also use a few Tesco grapes when making fresh fruit salad Some people use green grapes in recipes along with chicken I do not as hubby does not like sweet fruit and meat together.There are recipes using green grapes at http://www.honeyflowfarm.com/graperecipes.phpGrapes are good for you    A single seedless grape is about 3 calories. The grape is a low GI food.15     20 grapes is what is considered to be one serving of your recommended 5 a day fruit servings.So would I recommend  Tesco  green seedless grapes ?.......... yes     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6898018:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::5335750:4:::6755322:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::3957:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6657747:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6816341:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6636701:4:::6636701:4:::6840580:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6890814:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5790028:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6830048:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Tesco Tomatoes on the Vine Loose Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::06.09.2011::::    Loose Tomatoes on the Vine are the tomatoes I sometimes buy in Tesco. They cost    1.50 per kilogram.These tomatoes are displayed in the serve yourself fruit and vegetable section on the shop. I tear a plastic bag of the nearest hook. I then choose my tomatoes. Usually several tomatoes are on the same vine. I rarely just pick up a vine of tomatoes, I usually select ripe tomatoes   individually and pick them off the vine before putting in s bagThese tomatoes are usually in fair condition they are red not green, they are mostly ripe.I check the tomatoes to make sure they are not too soft but firm, the occasional one is soft. I make sure there are no blemishes on the skin and no bruises. I choose dark red ones. These Tesco tomatoes on the vine are usually ok the odd one not meeting my specifications. These tomatoes are sold by weight weigh them near the tomato stand or wait till you get not till where they are weighed and priced for you.Ideally I would like to sniff the tomatoes in store but I do not. When I get them home I can tell they have a sweet tomato odour. I often have a tomato in my packed lunch   usually cut up into a sandwich .I also use these tomatoes in a salad at home. I sometimes grill these tomatoes or even fry them. I occasionally add a couple that we have left over to a beef casserole. I tend not to use these tomatoes for cooked recipes though.Generally I think these on the vine tomatoes a reasonably good purchase. I do not find the skin tough, they have a good flavour. They are quite juicy.Tomatoes are very good for you. It has been shown that they are protective against a growing list of cancers.  The antioxidant has shown to prevent heart disease too.       ::::5719918:2:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6740155:3:::6859830:3:::6859830:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5261772:3:::6830992:3:::6830992:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6829585:3:::6882156:3:::6890814:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6878095:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6145850:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6840580:4:::6891381:4:::6891381:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6417876:4:::6417876:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Camping Pian Bosco, Chiusa Pesio::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::05.09.2011::::    Camping pian bosco Chiusa  Pesio Italy. Chiusa Pesio is just on the edge of the Italian Alps about an hour away from Turin. This summer we had decided to explore some of the French and Italian Alps which we had not visited before. So after camping a few nights in France we   crossed the border into Italy.Previous to our holiday we had looked on line and thought the area around Chiusa looked good and there were several campsites. We did not book as   we were not sure exactly when we would get there and how long we would stayHaving travelled through the Alps wondering at the amazing mountain scenery we came to Chiusa The Mountains not quiet as high here as there ones we had just passed through.The first thing that struck us about Chiusa was the black and white football shirt stripes everywhere and   signs saying Euventis       We had arrived the week Euventis was playing summer training against small local teams    I think Euventis home is Turin. All week there were matches against teams my husband had not heard of. I was amazed that hubby did not try to get tickets to watch any games.Chiusa is a very nice small Italian town.Enough of the football and Chiusa Pesio .  Now onto the campsite.We travelled out of the town on the SP5 as we had noticed several campsites marked along this road when we looked on the internet before setting off on holiday. We stopped when we saw the first site on our right hand side. We were not sure if they would take us as from the road although it said camping we could see it was mostly wooden cabins and caravans. We pulled over parked and found a small office at the entrance to the campsite.  I speak limited Italian about 5 words and they spoke limited English however   an n English speaking camper was fetched to aid us in our comprehension. Yes they had room for tents amongst the chalets and caravans was a very small grassy area big enough for 3 or 4 tents. We decided that we would stay here. *PriceThis campsite at euros 5.50 per person then 4.50 euros per tent and 2 euros for the car equalling euros 17.50 a night that was about    16. This was the most expensive this holiday. Italy is much more expensive than France in everything we found.*CarsCars are not allowed on site except for when you are erecting and taking down tents. There is parking at the front of the campsite.^There was only 1 other small tent on the site and we realised they were an Euventis supporters family and using the campsite as a place to stay while they went to all the games The grass on this area was sparse. We choose a flat spot and I removed stones from where we would put the tent. (I am no princess but do not like sleeping on stones.)  I found it very hard to put the tent pegs into the ground.   gt;This site is open all year. *Sanitary facilities A shower and toilet block with male and female separate. To operate the showers you need to buy a card for 10 euros. This card you present into a machine outside the shower cubicles then activate it when you are inside the shower cubicle you get a reasonable amount of time for 1 euro but be warned you can halt the water while you shampoo or soap but do not leave it too long before switching on or the shower will go cold. It was a bit of a drag having the meter outside. The toilets and showers were kept clean there were plenty of wash basins free hot water here. I found a clothes washing area as well as big basins there was a washing machine   , you needed to pay for washing machine. A washing line spread outside of the back of the sanitary block.   Other FacilitiesThe campsite was small which suited us. There was a tiny area for children to play on with a swing and a gravel area to run or play ball on. At the entrance to the site was a small bar selling tea, coffee a few snacks and I also noticed some liquors in dispensing bottles. While we stayed here we did not visit this bar. I did not notice many people in it or on the veranda outside. I did see the owners and a couple of other people sat outside chatting Camping pian bosco Chiusa  Pesio Italy.There is no shop, no swimming pool but it   s only a couple of k from Chiusa, where there are also plenty of bars and restaurants.*Dogs This site allowed pets a couple of dogs were there, not too noisy at nightThis was a fair campsite near some wonderful countryside and a lovely town would I recommend. Yes if all you want is somewhere to rest your head while you visit the locality. Would I go there again?

       " '5247778::::Blue Dragon Fine Egg Noodle Nests::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::05.09.2011::::    I bought some Blue dragon noodle nest to use when camping this year. Noodles are quick and easy too cook on a simple camping gaz.These 300g of  Blue dragon noodle nests can be bought at Asda for    1.19. Six nest in a packet. So for around 20p per serving that   s good.They come packaged in a clear plastic with some golden yellow pictures and words. There are 6 circular noodle nests in a pack each one a single person serving. The uncooked noodles are hard and brittle. I serving nest will give 178 cal These noodles just take 4 minutes of cooking in a pan of boiling water. I made sure mine were kept with water covering them and I agitated them occasionally While cooking these I pan fried some mushroom   s garlic, tomato and onion on the other gaz burner I sliced up cooked sausage and then added these to the  noodles This was a quick easy  meal to cook on the  camping gaz.  The noodles will keep the round nest like appearance when cooked, looks attractive on the plate.These did not small of much when cooking or cooked,When cooked the noodles go soft they look like long flattened pieces of spaghetti. If you want them in smaller pieces break the noodles before cooking. The noodles taste fine, bland so they really need tasty food or sauce to go with them.Usually noodles are associated with Chinese food. There are many recipes for noodle meals on line one that I have used is http://uktv.co.uk/food/homepage/sid/8161  I like these noodles quick easy to cook and go well with tasty food. Certainly a success on my single camping gazThese would be good for sensory art at school sticking them on paper painting and sticking a variety of things on them .     ::::5347743:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5261772:4:::6892550:4:::6892550:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6689426:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6145850:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6710771:4:::6710771:4:::6657747:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6858087:4:::6858087:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6840580:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Casino Fromage de Chevre::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.09.2011::::    Today I am going to tell you about Casino   s Fromage de chevre. Casino is a French supermarket chain where we bought some of our supplies when camping in the Alps this year Fromage that   s cheese de /of Chevre goat.  . I do not find it ever so easy choosing foods in a French supermarket as I do not want to choose exactly the same products as at home. This cheese was displayed on an aisle with other cheese; I find it easier to choose from chilled shelf than have to ask for what I want.  There were a lot of cheeses on display and I realised how much more expensive food was in France this year as compared with visits previous years. A lot of the cheese was expensive. I choose the fromage de chevre as it was   not maybe the cheapest but a price I thought ok. I am sorry I can not  correctly remember how much I paid but  looking online I found  on a casino sight that 180g  fromage de chevre costs     2,63euros gt;PackagingThis goat   s cheese comes in a round card pack 10cm in diameter 3cm thick. It has a picture of a goat standing in a grassy field with a blue sky backgroundInside was a foil pack enclosing a disk of goat   s cheese.  gt; ProductWe were sitting in a grassy Alpine meadow for our lunch and I opened the box. .The cheese is cased in a white waxed coating to protect it (like the sort you get on Brie).  The cheese is a white creamy colour I cut a hole into the cheese and removed some including the white waxed exterior to hubby he put it on his French bread. I do not like the coating so I put some of the cheese onto my bread. The cheese was soft very soft in the hot French sunshine the cheese was almost runny. So most of this cheese was eaten like a cheese dip. gt;SmellThis cheese did not smell strong it had a light creamy cheesy smell gt;.TasteThis cheese is a lovely gentle mild flavour. I was very happy with it. Hubby    said he thought it was OK.  gt;contents 180 grams cheese made from goats cheese. It is pasteurised has some salt added.   There are 88calories per30g  gt; Storage and use  This cheese does need to be kept cool in a fridge. However we did not have a fridge in our tent so we ate it all the same day we ate it. Although I could not try any on a single camping gaz there are many recipes at http://uktv.co.uk/food/ingredient/aid/506709 gt;Recommendation  RecommendationEnough that if I were to be buying cheese in France again I would choose this one .     ::::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6829585:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5719918:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6710771:4:::6710771:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5261772:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6840580:4:::5722049:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6697415:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6894799:4:::6894799:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5338981:4:::5338981:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5335750:4:::6866291:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6751010:4:::6699566:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6830048:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6657747:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6739881:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Camping at Le Sougey, St Alban De Montbel Rhone-Alpes::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::16.08.2011::::    Camping at sougey . Lac Aiguebelette France, Camping Le Sougey     Base De Loisirs  St Alban De Montbel Rhone-Alpes.We spent a couple of nights camping at Sougey by the side of. Lac Aiguebelette in the Rhone Alps France not far away from Aix les Bains. We were touring the French Alps and then into Italy making a circuit back into France again.Although we had looked on the internet at the location of several sites we had not made bookings as being free spirits we were not sure how long and exactly where we were going.There are several campsites around Lac Aiguebelette we had the map of this campsites location from the internet and it was not too difficult to find.  Leaving the A43 at junction 12, and at the roundabout taking the second exit we drove around the west bank of the lake. After a couple of miles we saw a small signpost for Le Sougey pointing left, and arrived. We had to park our car just outside the campsite as to gain access to the site a barrier needed to be raised. When you book your pitch there is a returnable deposit fee of 10 E for the barrier. When this is paid you are given a swipe card.  Arriving mid afternoon I went into the little office by the side of the barrier and was greeted by a staff member who could manage a little English. I was pleased to find there were a couple of spaces for tents left.   Some of the pitches were on grass some large shingle, the shingle more suitable for caravans. I was given a map of the site so we could find our pitch and the other facilities. Fortunately we were not pitched on a site   that ran next to the road which accesses the campsite so we were fairly quiet. We took a classic pitch for 2 people and 1 vehicle with no electricity this cost 18.20 Euros. There are larger pitches available and pitches for solo campers separated from the next by a small hedge making you feel private.  There were quite a few trees around the site these gave plenty of shade. There are electricity hook up   s and cold drinking water taps available between most of the individual pitches. The prices for camping are adjusted for the size and electricity. Children under 5 are free over 5   s cost 3.90E a night. You can take a pet for 1.90euros. There a few mobile homes and chalets available to rent too. For prices see http://www.camping-sougey.com/gb4.htmlThis site is suitable for disabled people , its flat and theere is a disabled persons shower and toilet.There were quite a few walkways on the site through to the sanitary facilities and the play equipmentThere are 2 toilet blocks on site we only used our nearest. The toilet block was kept very clean. The block consisted of 3 buildings with a central courtyard. One building contained unisex shower cubicles. The showers were fine free hot water reasonable amount of space. Outside of this building were washing up sinks.  One of the buildings contained a few more showers and washbasins and the laundry facilities, washing machines tumble drier, iron. You do have to pay for these I think. In this room was a freezer for campers to freeze their freezer blocks. Then the next block was toilets one end gents one end ladies. These were all UK style not French squatters. There is a chemical toilet disposal point here too. I was impressed with the cleanliness of these facilities.There is a small children   s play area with a couple of pieces of equipment, being on holiday from working with children I did not linger here. There is no swimming pool on site.There also seems to be a room next to the office which has children   s clubs I noticed children   s art work and toys inside. This campsite set by the side of a lake in the mountains has its own private beach with a lovely grassy area for picnics or games. There are pedalos that you can hire on the lake and it is safe for swimming. Not immediately on the camping site but on the  grassy beach there is a  bar and restaurant  , the views  from here were lovely and relaxing. Again not immediately on the camping site but just off it is a  very small shop selling essentials. Best stock up at the Hypermarket about 7k away before you get here.I enjoyed our 3 nights 2days here I felt it was an ideal position for a family with the lake and the facilities. A beautifull position  so close to the mountains and walks. We actually spent little day time on the campsite as we drove into the hills to walsand just came back to cook our meals over the camping gaz shower and sleep. The site was fairly quiet and not over lit enough to see where you were going if you needed to toilet block in the night but not too much illumination so I could not sleep.. This site is fairly near towns like Chambery and Aix les Thermes, Grenoble is not too far away.The one drawback is that to get from or into Chamb   ry you have to travel on the A43 which is a paege which costs over a euro each way. Also it   s a long drive from Calais.If visiting this area again I would certainly be happy to stay here again   would make a good base if we took the   gkids and family.

       " '5247778::::Camping-Leplan-Allemont, Allemont::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::29.08.2011::::    We stayed here as we wanted to explore and do some walking in this area. I noticed that most of the other campers were  walkers or cyclists , in fact there were many cyclists this is a very popular area ,( probably due to the Tour de France ) for cyclist Hubby wished he had his cycle with him.We entered the site and found the office, there was no one there but very soon someone came over and showed us where to pitch our tent.  The office is  open from 8am till 12pm and from 2pm till 7pm  s English is spoken here so it made our communications a little easier.  When we pitched our tent there was really not much room to park our car next to it. We were able to park it opposite the tent on a large free area. There are 90 touring pitches  for  caravans and tents and several pitches for static vans. There were a few trees on site giving some shad The site was a grassy area accessed by a road which took a circular route around the campsiteFor the tent 2 people and car we paid 10.8 euros per night this included tax. This was a good cheap price. We pitched our tent the ground was not terribly difficult to put tent pegs into the pitches were not very large our tent (a 4 man) took up most of our pitch.After pitching the tent I visited the toilet there were 3 sanitaire blocks on the site with joint ladies and gent   s toilets and showers. There was also a room with men   s urinals in it too separate from   the shared facilities If you are camping with a chemical loo  there is a disposal facility.The sanitary block was kept reasonably clean. The hot water in the showers was free and good the force from the shower good. Some large washbasins for clothes washing and some cubicles with just washbasins and mirror. I did not need them but there are automatic clothes washing machines.There were several drinking water taps around the site.. We did not want them but there are electricity hook ups available. Pets are welcome on siteThis is a municipal campsite and although there are not many facilities on site the website says drinks and snacks available but we did not notice this facility open.Next to the campsite are a swimming pool; tennis court, a climbing wall children   s play area and several caf   s and restaurants. There are general stores not too far away either. A doctors and a pharmacy are within walking distance too.We stayed here for a few nights and had to leave before 10am in the morning otherwise we would have had to pay for the complete day.Would I recommend this site? Yes  I do not think it as good site if you are  wanting to say on site all day and be provided with activities on site however good for staying at if you are exploring the area  like us and  do not need bars  clubs  on site.Website http://www.campings-camping.com/campings/allemont/allemontcamping/camping-mun.-le-plan-***-a3069.htmlffice open every day from 8am till 12pm      ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6800944:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5261772:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6840580:4:::6699566:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5362774:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Camping at Sospel Municipal Campsite, Sospel::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::24.08.2011::::    This summer we stayed at the municipal campsite in Sospel France for 2 nights.  Sospel is Alpes Maritimes is a d   partement in the Provence-Alpes-C   te d Azur region of France. Sospel is very near the Italian border, in fact we had been camping in Italy for a few nights previous to stopping at Sospel.There are several campsites in or near Sospel we chose the municipal siteThis site is situated on the edge of Sospel by the river Bevera, next to the municipal sports area with a football pitch on it.It is on the D2566 Route de MoulinetWe arrived at the campsite mid afternoon and booked in at the small office at the entrance to the site. A little English was spoken.  I paid 26.80 Euros for 2 nights   this was for 2 people tent and car so 13.40 Euros per night. With the pound at about 90p per euro this was about    12. I paid when we arrived at site but we could have paid when we left it.We were left to choose our own place to pitch our tent. So we drove around the edge of the site on the gravel road track and pitched our tent at the end of the campsite. There were no individual camping are for your tent marked.  The campsite was enclosed by a hedge and had one or two bays of grassy terrain big enough for several tents. There were a few bigger trees on the site to give some shade. This campsite is not very big has room for about 30-40 tents. Although we did not want it electricity hook ups are available. Now to pitch the tent  easy enough to put the tent together but  when it came to putting the tent pegs in the ground it was difficult the ground was solid   under the  thin sparse grass it was  rocky and stony the soil very compact. We had no hammer so wielding his shoe hubby did manage to put the tent pegs just into the ground; just as well it was not a windy night. There were 3 other tents pitched in our area none too close everyone was respecting each others personal space. The other campers had their cars parked next to their tents. We parked our car next to where we erected our tent. Because it is a fairly large estate and  it would have been a bit in the way for people to drive past also a bit difficult for hubby to turn it we parked  just  by the side of the gravel track next to the football pitch this was only a couple of hundred metres away  at most.There was no shop on the site and no bar or restaurant so we walked into the town finding a shortcut past a sports pitch it only took 5 minutes to walk into Sospel.After exploring Sospel we went back to the campsite to cook our evening meal on the camping gaz. I noticed no barbeques were allowed. There were several drinking water standpipes around the site.Near the entrance to the site was the sanitary block with dish washing facilities and separate ladies and gents toilets (Often in France the toilets are mixed sex) There were showers and wash basins too. If necessary you could hand wash clothes or I think I remember seeing aThe hot water in the showers was free and you could shower as long as you liked. The showers although not brilliant were ok warm enough and a good force, fairly clean. The sanitary block was OK.There is also a toilet and showers at the sports facility next to the campsite. (I noticed some other people coming back from here. There is no pool on site and I did not notice any play equipment for children. Dogs are allowed on site.The campsite was fairly clean and tidy. I was happy to camp here for a couple of nights would return if we visit the area again.I did not explore the municipal sports site next to the camp site but I know there was a football pitch and tennis courts and what looked like some good outdoor gym equipment.This site at Sospel is  in a good position for  visiting the small attractive town of Sospel and the Alps  , it is only 36km to Nice , The coast at Menton 15km and its only about 6 or 7 KM to the Italian border . Three Grande Randonnee route cross through Sospel the   GR. 52, GR. 5   , GR. of the 8 valleysThe website for the camp site is http://www.sospel-tourisme.com/component/option,com_alberghi/task,detail/Itemid,92/id,8/ map at http://campingmap.net/object.aspx/14760/Camp_Municipal The sitehttp://www.sospel-tourisme.com/ gives good info about Sospel and the area.

       " '5247778::::Vale Park, Aylesbury::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::04.09.2011::::    Vale Park, AylesburyI have visited The Vale Park in Aylesbury for many years. 50 years ago + I was a very young child my parents used to visit aged relatives in Aylesbury so we went to the park then.   I have visited many times since as I have lived in Aylesbury and surrounding villages now for most of my adult life. Aylesbury Vale Park is accessed from the high street (A41) or from Park Street just by the Aqua Vale Swimming and Fitness Centre. It is only 5 or 6 minutes walk from the train and bus stationsA good landmark is the canal. The Aylesbury branch of the grand union canal goes very close to the park from the high street to Park Street. It is only a short distance from the town and its car parks. There is also a bus stop right outside the park gates the 61 and 500 bus as well as some others can be caught here.  *Over the years since I have known this park a little has changed. There used to be an outdoor swimming pool   there is now Aqua vale indoor swimming pool and sports facility.The below are free facilities. *The children   s play area and equipment still in the same position nearer the Park road entrance has been renewed and updated the equipment suitable for up to 12 year olds.*Tennis courts are available too there are 2 hard courts for those who like to play.For the younger generation there is a small skate park* There is a multi use games area for football and basketball I have noticed children and teenagers using this areaI am not sure if this is free *There is a bowls green.  Bowles equipment can be borrowed from the park warden from 11am to 7pm   warden May to September Earlier closing in the winter I believe... Often when I walk through the park I see group of older people playing. As well as for casual games it   s also suitable for competition games.Lots of activities go on in the park, it hosts Proms in the Park  A free outdoor orchestral music event. I have never been so can not comment.Play day this is an event that takes place in the park activities for children one day in the summer holidays see http://www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/leisure-culture/events/play-park This park has been a park for sports since before 1884 being used   by athletics and bicycle clubs; it also had a cricket ground and pavilion in 1884. But as I said it has had several   revamps. The Borough Council in bought it in 1929.  The park covers 4 hectares  Aylesbury Vale Park has well established flower beds and trees.  There are the nationally rare native black poplars.It is suitable for disabled people having few steps and fairly good paths.  * Toilets  Yes there are toilet facilities they are usable Is a pleasant place to take a stroll or go for a picnic if you are in the town, a good place for the children to run and play? So if you are visiting yes I would recommend. Do not make a special visit from afar but if you are local do use its facilities.Photo s . the park does not really look like the added photo will see if I can download any.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6657747:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6830048:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6841809:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6840580:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.09.2011::::    I have always loved Liquorice.  Although I do not buy and eat Basset Liquorice allsorts frequently I must have eaten more than a few kilograms of them in my life time.Liquorice allsorts are manufactured by several company   s now but the favourite of mine are the original Basset   s liquorice allsorts.: Description.Basically a Bassets liquorice allsorts is a sandwich of fruit fondant and liquorice. They are sweet and soft.. They  smell sweet and   some a slight anise  scent.There are lots of different varieties of allsorts I think in each bag you will find at least 7.1   .. The cylinder. This is a short cylinder an outer layer of liquorice surrounds a cylinder of white coconut fondant paste. This cylinder sometimes has a pink coloured fondant cylinder in the centre.Taste.This is a good tasting piece of liquorice, liquorice tastes like anise.The centre white fondant tastes a little of coconut. I am not desperately keen on coconut. The fondant does not have a very strong coconut flavour2   .. Coconut rollsThese are short fat cylinder rolls of a cylinder of liquorice with a fat outer layer of sweet coconut fondant; this coconut fondant can be pink or yellow and has flecks of coconut in it.Taste.I dislike these coconut fondant tastes very much like coconut it   s horrible, however I have a friend who likes these.3   .Jelly button. Not sure if this is the official name of the circular jelly sweet that is covered with little sweet balls. .Taste is sweet and aniseed. The texture is like jelly. I usually pop this one straight into my mouth and chew it.4. chequered Liquorice Allsort.  This is a cuboid with 2 pieces of liquorice and 2 pieces of fondant in a chequered pattern.This one is a fairly recent addition I do not remember it from my youth.5      Three layered sandwich. This is a layer of thin liquorice in the centre of 2 layers of sweet fondant.  One of the layers of fondant is usually white supposedly coconut but I can not taste the coconut even though I dislike coconut.  The other fondant layer can be brown (chocolate (I can not discern this taste)) It could be pink or orange. The pink fondant layer does taste slightly fruity possible cherry perhaps strawberry, the orange layer is an orange flavoured but I can not taste it. The tastes of the fondant are sweet but do not really taste of anything much.6 The 5 layered sandwichThis is very much like the 3 layered except it has 3 layers of fondant and 2 of liquorice.Have you ever tried to separate the layers? I have getting my teeth and trying to strip the different coloured fondants from the liquorice layer. It   s possible, but difficult7 liquorice cylinderThis is   just as it sounds a pure piece of liquorice cylinder shaped no fondant at all.Sweet anise flavour 8 The Liquorice RosetteAgain as it sounds a circular rosette of pure liquorice sweet  9..... BertieThen there is the soft blue aniseed blueberry Bertie the allsorts mascot shape he is rather cute                                     ~~~~     ~~ Nutrition There are 380cal per100g of liquorice allsorts They contain sugar, treacle, wheat flour, gelatine, cochineal, and other colourings liquorice extract, desiccated coconut.  Sizes and priceUsually a big bag of these allsorts is bought to share with the family. You can buy215g bags at a lot of supermarkets At Tesco the 215 bag costs    1.48 at Asda its    1 Sainsbury   s    1.48 but on 2 for    2.00 offer at the mo, ocado    1.48.Also available in a 600g box for    4.00 at Tesco buy 2 for 2 get one free at the moment..It is possible to buy other sizes of bags and boxes of Bassets liquorice allsorts a 500 box and a 750 one and one of those large tins with 800g they cost about    6 I believe.                                    ~~~~HistoryBasset   s liquorice allsorts were first introduced in 1899 when an employee dropped a lot of sweets on the floor and a buyer thought they looked good and enquired about a mix of sweets.In 1929   Ernest Illingworth  an artist  drew and designed Bertie Basset it wasn t until 2009 that Bessie Basset was introduced to try and promote red liquorice on 12 February 2009 apparently the two sweet characters were married . Bassets a sweet making firm since 1842 was taken over by Cadbury Schweppes in 1989. I like Bassets liquorice allsorts and I would recommend them if you like liquorice but liquorice /anise is a taste that many dislike. Everyone has their favourite allsorts which is yours? I am torn between the pure liquorice piece and the 5 layered one.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6900048:4:::6900048:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6657747:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5347743:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6890814:4:::6894652:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6857875:4:::6857875:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6840580:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6870095:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6900073:4:::6900073:4:::6850640:4:::6850640:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6891381:4:::6891381:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6735325:4:::6743330:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brabantia Profile Line Non Stick Palette Knife::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::26.08.2011::::    I have a Brabantia palette knife to assist me in the kitchen.  A palette knife can also be called a spatula I would call it a spatula but Brabantia call their knife a palette knife. The do produce a spatula too the spatula has a wider blade.This knife has a shiny stainless steel handle and a non stick black nylon blade. The knife is 33cm long  handle 15 cm long, the blade 18cm long 3     cm wide. The stainless steel handle has a black nylon band with little knobbles on it this is good for my thumb to rest on and grip the knife.I find this knife easy to hold easy to use.The blade is firm not floppy it is a good length to get under any of my cakes or flans to assist me removing them from cooking pansI also use this palette knife when cooking omelettes loosening the omelette from the base of the frying pan and flipping it over, it   s handy for cooking pancakes too. I find the long blade gets completely under my omlettes to the other side.  I have also used my Brabantia palette knife to help spread butter icing flat on a large cake. I have used my palette knife often and in many cooking situations. I find it a useful tool I find this knife easy to clean by washing   with hot water and washing up liquid.  If you have a dishwasher it is safe to wash this in it.There is a 5 year guarantee on this knife I must have had mine for longer than this and it is still in good condition.This palette knife cost    4.11 at http://www.just-brabantia.co.uk/jb-brabantia-non-stick-palette-knife-363740.php at it costs    2.79 I think this palette knife would make a good wedding present with some other kitchen  tools     ::::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::5347743:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6887156:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6699566:4:::6840580:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6710771:4:::6710771:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Simena Archaeological Site (Turkey)::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::02.09.2011::::     Earlier this year we stayed at Kas in Turkey. We hired a car so we could explore   easily. One of the places we visited was the Simena castle   This castle is in the village called Kalekoy, or Kale, Simena is the ancient name of the village part of which is ruins under the sea. This castle is accessible by boat to the village harbour then up a windy road to the castle. You will be able to see where the castle is as a Turkish flag flies from it or alternatively do as we did and walk from near Ucaziz. If you are in Ucaziz you will see plenty of advertising for boat trips to Simena and kalekoy many trips   to the islands of kekova. Hubby does not really like water so is reluctant to go on boats. Alternatively do as we did and walk from near UcazizWe took a gravel road   to the east of Ucagiz which looped around the bay eventually after a few k we came to a parking area which was next to the cemetery and the. This road is part of the Lycian way.After we parked the car we walked up the hill on a reasonably well worn path through low bushes and thyme, we took our time passing and looking at several sarcophagi. It took us about an hour maybe a bit longer but we were slow. We carried a small rucksack each with water and snacks plus camera I would not want to carry a heavy load. I think the Sunflower guide had details of this route.We entered the small village of Kalekoy which has no roads, just paths next to the castle so we visited here first. We noticed a small ticket office and payed a few euros to enter the castle not many euros I think it was only 2 or 3 sorry can not remember clearly.This castle is a ruin of a medieval Byzantine castle. This castle was built as a fortress as the coast was raided by Arabs and pirates it   an outpost of the Knights of Rhodes (formerly of St. John).  The history is quite interesting.To be honest there is not a great deal left of this castle, the exterior walls   are not very high and you can see some of the individual rooms marked by low walls inside. Inside the castle is an amphitheatre of Lycia it   s very small the floor of the castle is rough so although there is an obvious path to view the remains inside it is very rocky. What is stunning about this castle is its peace its quiet no traffic apart from boats can be heard   also the view is amazing.  You can see for miles over the sea to the small group of islands called Kekova. Beautifull views all around. The sea blue with a speckling of boats   views of rocky shores. You can make out ruins out at sea this part of the city/ village was submerged by earthquakes in the 2nd century AD.Although there is not a great deal to see at the castle itself I think it was worth trudging up the hill to see. Of course it is much easier to access if you go by boat.Although I intended this review to be about the castle and we did not see the remains under the sea really I will tell you briefly about the rest of our visit. After we left the castle we went down hill to the harbour and had a drink in one of the bas/restaurants there. We sat supping our drink at a table outside looking at the sea and the partly submerged sarcophagi.  I could just make out some remains of buildings of the sunken city under the water.  It was very quiet at Easter very early season. We were talking to the owner of the bar and he said he and I believe most of the people living in this seaside village went away somewhere else in the winter. While we were   drinking our wine we saw the school boat delivering a couple of children home after the day at school, imagine that catching the boat to school rather than the bus.The fishing village of Kalekoy is charming.   After nosing around the village a bit we climbed back up to the castle and then down back to our car.If I were visiting this part of Turkey again I would visit but this time I would take a boat trip around the islands that would make it possible for me to see more.     ::::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6752066:3:::6752066:3:::6750576:3:::6882156:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6892550:4:::6892550:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6879769:4:::6879769:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5335750:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6900011:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6699566:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6840580:4:::6739881:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6757811:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

To be hones the Hebe does not appeal to me greatly its ok but that   s all. gt;This Hebe Blue clouds is a low growing plant only growing up to 100cm tall and as about as wide. Mine is growing on poor chalk soil and does not reach that height. It is quite happy to grow in most soils and will tolerate a sandy coastal soil. It likes well drained soils.This Hebe will grow in pots on a terrace I have seen them outside some peoples houses gt;This Hebe is an evergreen plant and has medium dark green pointy (lancelet) leaves. These leaves turn slightly purple in winter. I like the Hebe for giving some interest to the garden  in the winter. gt; The small tubular flowers with 4 petals grow on a fairly long 4 or 5 cm spike/racemes. This Hebe has a fairly dark blue flower as the name suggests. It flowers June to July and I have seen a few flowers on mine in September to December its not flowering yet though (3 sept) gt;Hebe is easy to look after. I rarely if ever water mine. Occasionally I will trim this shrub but it does not really need it. Hebe is frost hardy.I have not but you could propagate the Blue clouds Hebe by soft wood cuttings in the late summer autumn.

       " '5247778::::Gelert Mummy Sleeping Bag Liner::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::01.09.2011::::    I have a mummy sleeping bag also a mummy sleeping bag liner.  This review is about the Gelert sleeping bag liner.I have had my bag liner a couple of years now it was bought locally to find out where you can purchase one off line look at http://www.gelert.com/stockists/find  It   s available at several camping outlets on line, for example http://www.sleepingbagshop.co.uk/gelert-mummy-sleeping-bag-liner.html where it costs    10.99This bag comes in a black stuff sac measuring 17x 9 cm. it   s a good small size.When pulled out of the stuff sac and laid out the sleeping bag liner is 210cm long  it  tapers from 71 (Head) - 51cm (Foot).  it weighs 289g. so fairly light.This liner is much like a bed sheet it is quite thick poly cotton. This liner fits quite well into my sleeping bag which is also mummy style.Now here I must own up yes I have slept in this a few times  or at least tried to  but I find sleeping in a mummy bag hard  I can not sleep and keep my  legs  close enough together I sleep in the coma position with one leg straight the other knee  bent and there is just not enough  room to do this in a mummy  bag I did persevere for a time but eventually gave up as I  could not get comfortable , no fault of the bag I might add. My mummy sleeping bag has a zipped side and this is usually undone to accommodate my sleeping position.  This bag was not a complete waste of money as hubby is quite comfortable sleeping in it. One of the reasons for having a sleeping bag liner is to keep the sleeping bag clean .When we are camping for 2 or 3 weeks it can get quite sweaty it   s much easier to wash the liner than the sleeping bag. It  was very hot on some nights of our holiday too hot for a sleeping bag this is where this liner was ideal    it gave just enough warmth and covering  for husband .  I did try it one or two nights found it cooler than when inside my sleeping bag but I still found it too restricting.The fabric this sleeping bag liner is made from is good it   s   a soft polycotton it is a light blue colour. I can see this lasting quite a few camping holidays.I have washed it in the washing machine - no problems and it dry fairly quickly. I have now be giving  this to my husband as he seems to sleep well in it I shall resort to taking a sheet and shall be buying a non mummy sleeping bag       ::::6723241:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6829585:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6892550:4:::6892550:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::3957:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840580:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6735325:4:::6841809:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6751010:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6657747:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6757811:4:::5335750:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6885391:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Parsnips Loose Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::01.09.2011::::    I like parsnip; I usually buy my parsnips from Tesco where they cost    1.45 a kg. A parsnip is a root vegetable looks like a large creamy beige carrot.The parsnip resides in the vegetable section in Tesco I choose to0 buy loose veg as that way I can see and choose which ones I buy.@ChoosingWhen I buy a parsnip I choose a firm parsnip about the size of a large carrot not too big not too small 5 to 10 inches /12.5 to 25 cm long  . If too big the core will be woody. I look at the skin and make sure there are no blemishes no brown patches or cuts. When looking in the parsnip display tray I sometimes find parsnips not quite up to my specifications but not many.Tesco parsnips are generally in good condition still firm and not dirty the shapes are not very irregular. I am satisfied with the quality usually. @CostLoose parsnips cost     1.45 a kg a lot more expensive than carrots which cost 80p per kg. Cost in Asda is    1.44per kg Sainsbury   s    1.55 per kg, at ocado parsnips are    1.55 per kiloThere are those plastic bags hanging near by on the vegetable/fruit stands I put my parsnips in one of these. You can if you wish weigh your parsnips on a scale nearby; I do not as I know by sight how many I need. My parsnips are weighed when I purchase them at the till. When I was in France shopping in supermarkets   they all seemed not to have scales for the cashier at the till but you had to weigh and seal your bag in the veg/fruit section yourself.@Storage   I store my parsnips from Tesco in the bottom of the fridge where they will keep well for a couple of weeks@PreparationFirst I cut the top off the parsnip and the tail  Teso   s generally have the tail chopped off. Chop off any straggly roots that might be on   the Tesco parsnip.Parsnips need a wash and a scrub in cold water peels them if you wish it   s not really necessary with small young parsnips. I peel older ones with a potato peeler@UseI never have had but you can eat parsnip raw like carrot.I like roast parsnips they go well with roast meats.  You can make parsnip chips by frying them like you would potatoes sometimes boil parsnips like potatoes and mash them, sometimes mash a few into my potatoes too.I will add a few parsnip   s to the vegetables in my casseroles.Parsnips take about as long as a carrot or potato to cook. Boil for about 15 minutes.@Nutrition There are 66cal in 100g of parsnip. They al;so contain vitamin B1, vitamin B3, vitamin C, fiber, folate, potassium, phosphorous and iron.@Taste  A parsnip is something you either love or hate, I love them hubby hates them. They taste slightly sweet they have a strong flavour more like sweet potato than carrot. Taste is difficult to describe.There are lots of parsnip recipes at http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/search.do?keywords=Parsnip Generally I find Tesco loose parsnips satisfactoryttp://www.hgk.msb.gov.tr/english/englis        ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6892550:4:::6892550:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6657747:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6880805:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6898018:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5092706:4:::5092706:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5335750:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5203100:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6840580:4:::6841809:4:::6699566:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Firethorn (syn. Saphyr Yellow)::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::31.08.2011::::    Firethorn (syn. Saphyr Yellow)Firethorn (syn. Saphyr Yellow) I have several firethorns in my hedge at the bottom of the garden mostly ones with a red berry. There is one with a yellow berry and after looking up descriptions on line today I am sure it is the Saphyr yellow species. This bush was planted over 20 years ago before we moved here.Saphyr yellow often printed as Sapphire yellow depending on where you look. This shrub will grow to 4 metres tall if not trimmed. I have nearly finished trimming my Pyracantha as there were many shoots and I did not want a very tall hedge. Also trimming back the branches exposes the yellow berries.   I have a well drained chalk soil its fairly fertile The Saphyr yellow pyracantha seems to thrive on it.Pyracantha   likes sun or part sunny positions. It is a hardy plant.Mine grows on a well drained chalky soil*leavesThis is an evergreen shrub with dark green pointy leaves. The leaves grow on the short branches of the bush there are a lot of sharp prickles on the branches*FlowersIn May the small white flowers appear speckling the hedge. They smell quite sweet.  Bees like the flowers.Berries The berries on my Saphyr Yellow are forming now but have not any colour yet. The berries are on the firethorn from early autumn through the winter. While the birds rapidly eat the berries on my red Pyracantha they are not so keen on the yellow berries.Although I read these berries are not poisonous to humans I imagine they are very bitter.*PruningThe yellow berried Pyracantha does need pruning to keep it in control. Pruning at the wrong time of the year will affect the production of flowers and berries. I prune trim the new straggly growth now after the berries are formed. I may prune a wayward branch in the spring but I tend not too as I might cut the flowering branches off. Pyracantha will take a hard pruning if it is getting unruly I have to the detriment of flowers and berries  pruned a pyracantha back very hard one year It recovered well and is now a vigorous  bush.Yellow saphyre  pyracantha can be bought at many garden centres and on line.  http://www.shrubsdirect.com/shop/Pyracantha-Yellow-Sapphire.html has some in pots for    4.70. I imagine the off line garden centres selling this shrub for somewhere between    3 and    10 pounds depending on size If you wish to plant a pyracantha hedge   autumn is an ideal time. . This yellow and the other coloured pyracantha will make a thick prickly hedge ideal for keeping intruders out. Be warned the thorns are viscous very prickly wear gloves and long sleeves     ::::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6816341:4:::6841809:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5816422:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6866291:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It is a very handy item.This oval dish holds 4.5 litres this will hold just about enough food for 6 people. The dish is 230cm wide x390cm long x150cm high. This oval dish unlike my other oval Pyrex dish has a lid it also has two handles with grip on, one at each long end.The handles help lift it in and out of the oven.This is really a versatile dish I have used it for many recipes. It holds a good sized family casserole.  I often make a huge casserole use some and freeze the rest for another day.I usually use mine in my gas oven but Pyrex is able to be micro waved however this pot is a bit big for my microwave. If I had a dish washer this Pyrex dish is suitable for it. However I do not own a dishwasher so I wash it by hand.Pyrex is stain resistant   mine still is clear after many years of use.If I burn anything around the handles it often stays there until I scrub with a scratch free scourer. Pyrex glass is strong the glass on my dish is quite thick. It would take quite a bit to break it. Pyrex is heat resistant to 300 c however do not heat it on the hob. This  dish is quiye smart enough to use as a serving dish too You can buy this Pyrex casserole dish for    18.50 at Debenham   s it   s from    13.89 + postage at http://www.amazon.co.uk.

       " '5247778::::Cooling Rack::::Household Appliances::::50::::very helpful::::27.08.2011::::    A cooling rack is usually made out of wire usually stainless steel and probably non stick. It is usually a rectangular tray made up of either parallel wires or grids. It also usually has at least 4 small wire feet these are usually about 1.5-2. cm high to hold the tray above the surface that it is resting on the air can circulate then to speed the cooling surface. Sometimes you can get a circular cooling rack and I have seen 3 tier stacking cooling racks ideal if you bake a lot of biscuits.I have 5 cooling racks at the minute mostly they are really the wire tray that came inside my grill pan I have bought one or two separately but I can not remember where from it was a cook shop My wire cooling trays are dual purpose I grill on them and use them top cool my cakes and sausage rolls.My cooling racks are different sizes one 40 x 25cm this is a good large one I use it to cool my cake when I have done a tray bake. Its size is just a bit bigger than my cake tray also it   s too big to go in my present oven. I notice Amazon have a similar if not the same one for    4.51. I also have two slightly smaller ones 25 x 35 Amazon price    3.99 I also have a round one the size of a standard round cake Amazon price    4.25. Amazon has quite a range ion its website see http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8 node=10708961Wilkinson has some cheap ones at    1.75p each.Some of my cooling trays have parallel wires I find these not as strong as the one with wires in a grid. Also I find delicate sponges will sag through the parallel wires they are supported much better with a grid.  Small biscuits will also slip through the parallel wire cooling trays so I really do prefer to use my grid one. The grid ones do seem to be more expensive though.These cooling trays really are useful I use them a lot. I use my cooling racks to cool my cakes and pies down to make sure they do not get soggy bottoms.I find a cooling tray helpful aiding me to get a large  cake out of its tin I take the cooked cake out of the oven  loosen /free the cake from the tin  by   sliding my spatula /palette knife between cake and tin . I then place cooling rack on top of cake and invert the cake   I then can remove the tin from the cake hopefully it is not stuck.These trays are ideal for cooling biscuits that I have baked, if left in tin the bottoms might go soft. I usually let my cakes stay in the cake tins for 5 to 10 minutes then they are easier to remove. I then rest them on the cooling tray till they are cool before I put them in a cake tin.  Ideal for cooling a quiche on the pastry bottom does not go soggy. I sometimes use my cooling racks to rest a hot pan on when I remove it from the oven this protects my surfaces from the heat. Cleaning these cooling racks if only used for cooling cakes should be fairly easy with hot water and washing up liquid, if used in the grill pan as some of mine are then you may need to use a scourer on themI store mine in my pan cupboard with my baking trays Thanks for reading about my cooling trays , see the photo   s sorry I was not baking today so any cakes.Sorry about the specific criteria take no notice of it. has to be filled in to get ciao to print the  review     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6689426:4:::6894652:4:::6866291:4:::6800944:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6699566:4:::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::6830048:4:::6887156:4:::6657747:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6896104:4:::6896104:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6750576:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6751010:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Red Seedless Grapes Loose Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::30.08.2011::::    I often buy grapes from Tesco sometimes I choose ones green sometimes red.The red ones that I buy are the loose ones. They are piled high in the box in the fruit section of the supermarket. Bunches of red grapes are presented ready in plastic bags.  ChoosingThe bags contain different weights of bunches of red grapes usually around the 600g mark. I choose a bag with about the number of grapes that I will eat before they go bad.I am quite fussy about the grapes I choose. I inspect the bunch and choose the best looking one then I will remove single grapes from the bunch if they are looking mouldy or wrinkled.The grapes I choose are plump, and all red they are still attached to stem firmly, SmellThey smell lightly fruity a fresh smell. Old grapes going mouldy  smell unpleasant.Mow I have chosen my bag of grapes I usually put them in another plastic bag which is available hanging up somewhere in the fruit section. Although I choose those grapes that are in a bunch still firmly attached to stems some might fall off in transit so this second bag will keep the grapes from falling out of the first bag.I can weigh my grapes at the fruit section if I wish. PriceI   buy the grapes at the till and they get weighed and priced they cost    2.48 a kilo I just compared prices and Sainsbury   s red grapes cost    4.97 / Kg Green grapes at Tesco cost    3.47 / Kg. StorageI take my grapes home making sure they are on top of my shopping as I do not want squashed grapes. I wash my grapes before I put them in my fruit bowl as grapes are known for still having residues of Pesticide. I then put them on kitchen towel to dry.If I am not going to be eating my grapes the same day or day after I have bought them they are best  put in the fridge unwashed they keep better, although grapes will only keep in good condition after they are bought for about   a week days.My grand children love these red grapes, they prefer them to green .I think it   s mostly the colour that attracts them.

This bread bin is made of beech wood  which is a nice golden brown colour .Today you can buy it at Amazon FOR    23.96 RRP 29.95.This bins style suited us it looked good the roll top made the bread easy to access. The roll top lid has a small wooden handle at the bottom and you slide the lid up the lid is slatted beach wood and slides up into the top of the bin. The bin 39cm x 28cm x 18cm was big enough for a very large loaf. I remember trying to squash tea cakes in there as well as a large loaf with not a great deal of success. This bread bin was easy to clean .I would just wipe the bread crumbs out  and wipe it over with a damp soapy cloth Then I would dry it with a tea cloth and also leave to lid open so it  air dried thoroughly before I put fresh loaves in it. This   bread bin looked neat on my kitchen surface quite attractive.I like to keep my bread in a bread bin. This cooking time roll top bread bin was fine. It did keep my bread dry I used this bread bin every day.The reason why we bought a different bin was because this bread bin got dropped on a hard floor few times and the wood broke a bit and the roll top would not roll up properly. I owned this bread bin about 3 years before it  broke.     ::::5719918:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6657747:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6840580:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6894799:4:::6894799:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5335750:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5203100:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6866291:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The inner rings of skin are white tinged with red very attractive to look at.Tesco Red onions still smell. They have a sharp but sweet aroma   that pervades everything also lingers for a long time in the air or on the hands. To remove red onion smells from hands rub /wash with a lemon.

If preparing a salad for guests I usually use red onions. They go well with a cheese dip.I use red  onions when ever I need a raw onion and think I would like the red colour to enhance the look of the  meal I rarely use red onions for cooking as they tend to loose the red colour.Tesco has a website with recipes to use onions its http://www.tescorealfood.com/recipes/search.html?st=onion gclid=CN7oipWr8aoCFYuIfAodXUQ2Nw There is also a good red onion recipe site at http://www.grouprecipes.com/red-onion.I fancy trying to make some red  onion red onion chutney.

       " '5247778::::Stonecrop (syn Autumn Joy)::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::27.08.2011::::    There are many species of sedum they are all succulent plants which grow well in drought conditions they are attractive flowering perennials which are easy to care for.I have some autumn joy in my garden this is a stonecrop Sedum Herbstfreude, also known as ice plant it is not just a feeling I get in the late summer and autumn sun.I would really recommend this plant.  Autumn joy is an easy to grow easy to care for perennial.Autumn joy grows to Height 60-90 cm/2-3 feet.Width:  60cm/2 feet  The leaves are a dark green fleshy and succulent; they grow in whorls/rosettes, and make a clump.  It is easy to propagate and make new plants once your sedum has increased its number of leafy whorls/rosettes just  remove one with the roots and plant it somewhere else you will soon have a thriving new plant.The stem will grow up to a height of 2-3 foot and at intervals has fleshy leaves growing on opposite sidesThe flowers are small and star like they cluster together to form a flat head 7 cm/3 inches on top of the stalk. The flower heads on my plant started to form late June they looked like a green broccoli / cauliflower. Now in August I can see some pink colour just waiting to burst through. As the flower matures they become red and darken. These flowers make a great colour for the autumn garden Flowering August through to October even November.These plants do not need much looking after they grow well on my chalky soil ideal for a rockery. When first planted water well and fairly regularly till the roots are well established. After that they do not need much water as they are a succulent and store water in leaves and stem. Tidy away any dead   leaves and the dead flower heads although looking quite attractive to begin with will get tatty so tidy these when you want to. I usually wait till spring to tidy mine. After 3 years you should have quite a big clump of autumn joy you can divide the plant in spring time. .The main reason why I have this plant in my garden is that it is attractive to butterflies and bees. Small tortoiseshell and red admiral will visit this plant.To be honest I rarely see butterflies on Autumn joy / Sedum Herbstfreude Butterflies seem to prefer the Sedum spectabile/  Hylotelephium spectabileAmazon is selling this plant for    9.99  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sedum-spectabile-Autumn- however you should be able to purchase it in your local garden centre for    5  better still  get a cutting from someone .     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5347743:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6893330:4:::6893330:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6899045:4:::6899045:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6887156:4:::6666075:4:::6666075:4:::5790028:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6882156:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5203100:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5816422:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6866291:4:::6699566:4:::6841809:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6895556:4:::6895556:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Sometimes a slice of lemon and an ice cube makes a drink refreshing. It   s not long since I bought a real lemon to make a lemon cake.Although concentrate lemon is OK I prefer to use a real lemon. I usually buy mine in Tesco since this is where it is most convenient for me to shop. Tesco lemons can be found in the fruit section. Today they will cost 35p each Sainsbury   s 30p and Asda 30p, 4 for a pound I always check my fruit when I buy it that   s why I prefer the unbagged loose fruit. I look to see if the lemon has a smooth skin and are a bright yellow colour, I make sure there are no brown spots and that the skin has no green tinge. I check the skin is not wrinkled. Tesco does have a few lemons with green or brown marks on the skin some that do not look a bright yellow and so not ripe, the lemon although soft should not be too limp and saggy, the skin not wrinkled. I am not too worried if the lemon is misshaped not a pure oval. I can usually find lemons at Tesco which are ok.I put my lemon in a plastic bag then in my trolley get the rest of my shopping then go to the till, no need to weigh as lemons are sold per item not by weight.I get home unpack my lemon and store it in fridge it will keep several weeks if stored in fruit bowl only stores a few days.I sniffed it and it smelt like a lemonTo use a Tesco lemon for cooking. I will wash my lemon if I am using the skin  to wash other peoples germs off I imagine a lemon is touched many times ,also I wash it to remove any residue of sprays used on it when growing .(I am not sure if  these lemons have been sprayed with pesticides but best wash it  just in case.)  I use a sharp knife to cut it in half then twist the lemon on my lemon squeezer a lot of juice comes out of   a Tesco lemon I think they are a good fruit I can then use the juice on a pancake with sugar or some in a cake, lemon on cut apples will prevent the apple from going brown. I store unused juice in the fridge or if I only squeeze half I cover other half with cling film and store in fridge. Home made lemonade is lovely on a hot summer   s day.I sometimes grate the lemon peel after I have washed it, I grate it straight into a cake mix to make lemon cake, I use the fines rasp on my grater.Another way to use lemon is in home made beauty preparations  See http://www.care2.com/greenliving/lemon-juice-kitchen-cupboard-beauty.html Tesco lemons would be ideal to use in these recipes.I am usually happy with the lemons I buy at Tesco they are of fair qualitySometimes Tesco lemons have a sticker on them with the country they were grown in.There are many recipes where you can use a Tesco lemon see http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/lemonLemons although they are not a sweet fruit  tasting  bitter sour they taste good usually used with sugar  or a sweetener as they  have a zingy taste that makes your lips pucker.

I prefer to buy the loose ones rather than those packaged as I can choose each garlic bulb. There garlic bulbs can be found in the vegetable section usually nears the onions. When I choose my garlic bulb I look very carefully to make sure it is not damaged or  any of the cloves are shrivelled I like a  bulb of garlic with good plump cloves , There are usually somewhere between 10 and 15 cloves on a  Tesco garlic bulb. I also check that the garlic is not withered and soft sometimes in the garlic tray there are bulbs that do not meet with my satisfaction.When I chose my garlic I choose one that is  firm and plump not soft or shrivelled not spongy . So I do feel them.I like one with the white papery skin still on it; I do not choose garlic with a green shoot where it has started to grow. Tesco garlic sometimes is a bit pinkish I think that must be the variety.Tesco garlic bulbs are usually a reasonable quality. I pit my chosen garlic bulb into a little plastic bag which are hanging up somewhere nearby. I then complete my shopping and go to the till. I place my goods including the garlic on the  belt next to the till  The assistant types in garlic and the price comes up this week  the price is 30p  as is  Sainsbury price too at  Asda  price is 26p. I pay for all my goods and go home I unpack my garlic and place it in my garlic potTesco   s garlic will keep several weeks if kept dark and cool open to the air, that   s why my earthen ware pot is good. Do not keep garlic in plastic bag it will go manky.I use Tesco garlic to make garlic bread, garlic mushrooms, spaghetti Bolognese and other tomato pasta dishes.

       " '5247778::::London Pottery Co. Teapot::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::25.08.2011::::    The London pottery co seems to make mainly teapots. I am using a green London pottery tea pot at the moment I have had it for about 4 years. I have had and broken other London pottery tea pots too.London pottery tea pots are made of earthen ware they are a classic shape I like the rounded shape of a classic teapot.The pottery of these teapots is quite thick they are substantial they do not feel fragile.  They will break, one of mine did when dropped from a table onto stone floor.+Size. Capacity You can buy 2 cup/550ml capacity, 13 x 11 x 18cm 4 cup, and 38fl oz - 15 x 13 x 22cm 6 cup, 48fl oz - 17 x 15 x 25cm capacity  .8 cup, I do not think they make an 8 cup pot 10 cup 21cm x 19cmx 32cm. The amount of water that they hold to make that quantity of tea is good.I have a 6 cup because I sometimes make tea for 6 people also hubby and I often have a second cuppa in the morning.+ GlazedThese teapots are glazed inside and out with a shiny coloured glaze. +colours  There are many colours available you should be able to find one to compliment your kitchen or tea service. There is a green one (mine) Red, black brown, blue tallow orange white, and pink. There are also glazes with designs on spotty ones, hearts and flowers ones with leaves on a sheep one or a chicken teapot+HandleThis is a sturdy curved handle I find it comfortable to hold while pouring.+Spout This is a good shape and it pours well no drips+LidRound lid fits well designed so it will not fall off when you are pouring tea.=WashingI just rinse mine in warm water sometimes was it in hot soapy water is dishwasher safeApparently you can use it in the microwave, I have not needed too.I have had a London pottery farmhouse infuser teapot all this is the teapot with a stainless steel infuser to place inside it this is good as it is basically an internal tea strainer. I prefer tea made with real tea leaves rather than tea bags. However you can use either loose tea or teabags in this teapot  the tea bag will not go half way up the spout  and then get stuck.

       " '5247778::::Swizzels Matlow Love Heart Mini Rolls::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::23.08.2011::::    These little mini rolls of love hearts are really sweet. I have seen them a several weddings. As a child too many years ago I remember eating love hearts these were from the larger packs.  The first love heart sweet was made in 1933 by Swizzles Ltd and I believe much the same as now.I am not sure how long the smaller packs have been available, but it is several years now. I did in fact buy lots of these mini packs for favours at my daughters wedding a few years ago.The grandchildren had a mini pack as a treat recently so as I was offered a sweet I had oneA mini pack weighs about 10g it holds 7 sweets. These sweets are the standard love heart size.  The sweets are arranged together to make a cylinder and packaged in pink foil then have a paper outer with a few pictures of love hearts on.Each pack is about3.1/2 cm longAppearanceI believe that love hearts are a sweet bought for their appearance and the message on them rather than the taste, so I shall tell you about their appearance first.A love heart is a small circular sweet 19mm in diameter they are about 4mm thick. Just inside the circumference is an embossed heart shape inside this heart shape is a short message of 1, 2 or 3 words these words are written in capital letters. The heart and the words are topped with a red colouring.Messages There are many messages that are written on love hearts   ones I can remember are BE MINE , MY BOY, LOVE ME, I LOVE YOU ,New words and messages  do get added to love hearts,  EMAIL ME and FAX ME were added a few years agoColoursEach love heart is a single colour there are 6 different coloured hearts each pack usually has 1 of each colour. The colours are red, yellow, and white, green, orange, purple .Each of these colours is a different flavour.Flavour. TasteThe flavour of love hearts is slightly fruity, not a strong flavour. Red is a cherry flavour, yellow is a lemon flavour, white is vanilla, green lime, orange tastes orange Purple, I am not sure it   s a berry perhaps a mix. These sweets are sweet and all taste slightly sherberty.SmellSweet sugary a hint of fruit  depending on the flavour , not strong smellingTexture These sweets are hard they are ideal for sucking or chewing, not many chews before they disappear though. When the heart is in your mouth it begins to disintegrate quickly into a slightly gritty powder this is slightly fizzy, has a slight sherbet effect they are not as fizzy as refresher sweets though. The Effervescence produces a tiny amount of foam. Trying to suck one to see how long you can make it last does not take many seconds.Ingredients  There are no artificial colours in love hearts and they are Suitable for vegetarians they are Gluten free in 18g of love hearts there are 63 calories so in a min pack of 10g I think that   s about 34calPriceThese sweets are inexpensive in the shops cheaper to multi buy on line   A pack of 100 rolls will cost you    8.75 at http://compare.ebay.co.uk/like/320660960969? 100 A single pack will cost http://www.bubbleandsqueakballoons.net/love-hearts---mini-tube-1-3579-p.asp  15pThese mini packs are ideal for party bag fillers, wedding favours or sweet treats for many occasions.

       " '5247778::::Philips HD4644::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::21.08.2011::::     Recently yet another kettle failed in my house it just stopped working, fuse was ok so rather than getting someone to mend and charge me more than a new kettle I bought a new one.  I bought a Phillips 1.7 l 3000 W 1 cup indicator kettle. This was purchased at Amazon.  RRP    28.09 Amazon price    19.981PackagingThis kettle came in a card box with a picture of it on it and inside these was some card to keep the kettle from moving about in the box too much.Instruction leaflets were in the box too. These instructions are easy to read.  AppearanceThis kettle is a cordless jug kettle it is slightly curved. The body of the kettle is a white plastic it has a small spot. The base is grey as is the lid; the handle is both grey and white  Capacity This kettle will boil a single cup up to 1.7L. The see through plastic gauge at the side of the kettle measures the water fill in cups up to 6 cups then the maximum 1.7 litres. It is fairly easy to see the water and levels on the gauge. One of the reasons why this kettle was bought was because of its one cup boiling capacity. The last kettle would boil nearly 3 cups as its minimum. This kettle should save me some money on my electricity bill.The one cup gauge is accurate  it is enough to fill a mug  for my really huge mugs  about  half the size bigger than a standard one I need to fill it to the 3 cup mark for 2 big mugs full. If I make a mistake and switch the kettle on when it is empty it will automatically switch off  Operation Position the kettle on the base the way the base is moulded confused me at first and I thought the kettle fitted into the base the wrong way up. However I realised this pretty quickly and put the kettle onto the base correctly. Next I plugged the plug which is attached to the base on a cord 0.75m long into a socket on the wall. This cord can be wound round under the base for storage. A light is visible when the switch at the base of the kettle is depressed to switch it on it switches off when boiled. Before using the boiled water for a cup of tea Phillips advise you to rinse the kettle then fill the kettle boil it discard the water then repeat this once more. I had another  new kettle different brand recently which although I rinsed boiled rinsed boiled for  many times  the water still tasted of plastic I returned the kettle as  cups of tea tasted vile. The water from this Phillips kettle does not taste of plastics     Noise Yes there is some noise when it   s boiling but I have had both quieter and noisier kettles before.  Filling and Pouring This kettle can be filled either through the spout or through the lid which can be opened wide with the lid latch.    Boiling time The time it takes to boil this kettle is quite rapid. , if you wish to stop  the boiling  before it has finished then  just push the lever up .  Descaling and cleaning I live in a hard water area usually fill kettle with filtered water. There is a scale filter in this kettle to stop particles of scale being poured into   your drink it is advised to clean the scale filter regularly either with white vinegar or a descaler. Do not immerse the kettle or base in water and only clean the outside with a soft cloth and mild cleaning agent I am happy with my new kettle boils efficiently , looks good.  I hope it lasts longer than other that I have had. There is a 2 year guarantee on it Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on Polly put the kettle on well all have tea , Sukey take it off again     ::::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6894799:4:::6894799:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5816422:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6830048:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6841809:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6880805:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6887156:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6866291:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6894652:4:::5203100:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6891381:4:::6891381:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Henry Watson Pitcher 1 Pint::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::20.08.2011::::    The original Suffolk terracotta country pitcher is from a range made by Henry Watson Potteries which was founded in the early 19C.I have owned my pitcher for several years now. I think I purchased in John Lewis. Looking on line I notice this pitcher is available at several on line shops priced    16.75 at http://www.henrywatson.com/retail-shop/collections/original-suffolk-terracotta.    19.95 at http://www.amazon.co.uk. This red brown thick earthenware jug will hold 1 pint. It is h10cm x 7cm. This jug is a classic style rounded body a little spout for pouring and a handle.The handle I find a good size for grasping and clutching with my fingers curled round it. The inner of the jug is glazed and non porous. The outside non glazed has writing on one side saying    The original Suffolk country pitcher. Ideal for use at home or on safari   Now this is a classy jug .It is a light red brown .It looks good. When you pick it up although not heavy it feels substantial. This jug would break if it were to be dropped. This jug is country kitchen style looks great with my pine woodwork. I keep mine on an open shelf in the kitchen. To be honest I do not use this jug everyday. I use it if I have guests. Milk looks good in it at breakfast time, or custard or sauce at dinner time. This jug does not dribble it pours well. The jug is not tainted by the flavour of the sauces I have used it for before. It has not discoloured.I wash mine with warm water and washing up liquid but it can be washed in the dishwasher (I do not own one).I find this jug useful on many occasions it is versatile will hold cold e or hot liquids.I love my Henry Watson pitcher and the other products in this range.     ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5719918:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6880805:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5347743:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6874193:4:::6874193:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6866291:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6894652:4:::6657747:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6882156:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::La Boulangere Croissants::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::17.08.2011::::    When camping in France recently I bought a pack of 2 prepacked croissants from a Shop at  an Aire de repose on our way southwards through France.These croissants cost me 1.08 euros which is about a pound.  These were in a clear plastic bag with the name and logo of La Boulergere, which I think means the bakers wife or the baker   s girl.  La Boulangere is a French bakers which was founded in 1985.I opened the packaging easily and removed the croissants. The croissants were a light golden brown colour they smelt    bready   .The croissant was slightly crescent shaped   with the appearance of being a rolled up dough, they were not huge , big enough but not large. My croissant felt soft, it was unlike most croissants it was not flaky and crumbly.One advantage of these croissants was that they travelled well not falling to pieces. This croissant tasted nice beady and slightly buttery. I thought this croissant more bun than croissant like really thought as it was not flaky like the ones bought in a French bakers, I did not loose flakes of the pastry dough everywhere.  I felt it was quite an English style croissant, I thought it quite sweet.Although these were nice I prefer croissants straight from the bakers which are all flaky and more buttery.     ::::5505847:2:::5505847:2:::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::5552133:2:::5552133:2:::6898488:2:::6898488:2:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6823885:3:::6823885:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5261772:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6220775:3:::6220775:3:::6741192:3:::6741192:3:::6840624:3:::6840624:3:::6044343:3:::6044343:3:::6757552:3:::6757552:3:::6743627:3:::6743627:3:::6657747:3:::6894890:3:::6894890:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6830992:3:::6830992:3:::6894623:3:::6894623:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6880805:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6773030:3:::6773030:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::6889612:3:::6699566:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::6864647:3:::6864647:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::6886167:3:::6886167:3:::6843355:3:::6841809:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5722409:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6866291:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Carrots Loose Class 1::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::16.08.2011::::    My family like carrots, I do not grow enough for our needs so I usually shop in Tesco so frequently you will find some of the Tesco   s loose carrots in my trolley. These carrots are easy to find they are displayed in the fruit and veg section which is just inside the door at my local Tesco s. There are usually quite a lot of these carrots in the serve yourself bin that they are kept in.I usually do the rest of my shopping first then get my fruit and veg last.These carrots are the ones with the green leaf tops already removed. The look as if they have been washed they are usually quite clean no soil adhering to them. I usually check the price first. I notice on line today they cost 70p per kilo.Next I tear off one of the plastic bags that are available to put them in. Then I choose my carrots. I am quite fussy and do not choose the one that is very green or the one that has blemishes or cracks on it. I check the carrots are firm not limp; they usually are fine. I imagine the turnover is quite fast so shelf storage not too long. I then choose the carrots by size and shape; I like my carrots fairly straight with not too many divided pieces. I like my carrots a medium size. So my carrots selected bag tied so they do not fall out. I could weigh them at the counter scales are available but I usually do not bother the checkout assistant will weigh them when I pay.When I have paid I take the carrots home. I do not usually buy many so rarely have the problem of them going limp and unusable. I remove them from the plastic bag and  store mine in the fridge they last longer that way , mine will last a couple of weeks.I use the Tesco carrots as a cooked vegetable with meats, casseroles and pies, I also use them raw in a carrot salad, and my granddaughter loves a raw carrot to nibble on. They make a good carrot cake too. To prepare  these carrots for cooking and eating I will wash and scrape the outer    skin    off , sometimes I use a veg peeler to  get the outer     skin off    I chop of the head (carrot top)  and tail (root end) either put  these on my compost heap or send them to my grand children   s rabbit. I will then chop the carrots as circles or batons ready for cooking.If boiling they take between 10 and 15 minutes to cook.I find the flavour of these carrots good and the grandchildren like them too.I find these Tesco carrots perfectly acceptableCarrots have about 35kcal per100g they are fat free, Cholesterol free high in vit A and a good sauce of fibre.     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6723241:3:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6239059:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6657747:4:::6882156:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5261772:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6890814:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6751010:4:::6699566:4:::5790028:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6841809:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Suttons Borage Seeds - Herb Seeds (Culinary)::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::15.08.2011::::    I have several Borage plants/Borage officinalis growing in my garden, these plants are self set from Borage plants which I grew from a pack of Suttons borage seeds a few years ago.In case you are not familiar with the borage plant I will tell you what Borage is.Borage is an annual herb. It will grow between 30 and 90cm /12-36in tall and spreads to about 30cm/12in wide. It   s quite a straggly and floppy plant. The leaves and stems of borage are hairy and prickly. The leaves dark green and about 7cm/3in long. The stem is rounded and hollow. The 2cm/3/4inch flower a beautiful blue is 5 pointed petalled star shapes, the plant is sometimes called starflower. In the centre of the flower there are 5 stamens with black anthers they stand out making the flower really pretty. These Borage seeds RRP is    1.69 they are available at garden centres and some supermarkets which sell seeds now. You can buy them on line at many outlets one is http://www.capitalgardens.co.uk/borage-seeds-p-7712.html.  You may pick up some borage seed packets in the sale now as it is past their sowing time.*Sowing and growingThe sowing time for Borage seeds is April to May.Borage seeds are small and black, to sow these seeds first open the Suttons seed packet which gives full instructions. I sowed mine straight into the garden soil in my herb garden. According to Suttons there should be about 70 seeds per packet which should be more than enough for a garden.  My borage germinated well I watered it when the weather was dry .The borage needed very little attention really grew well. Because they are hairy I prefer to use the borage leaves while they are young. The Borage flowers in June right through the summer. Borage produces many flowers and seeds and will self set all over the place, mine has. In the autumn the plant will die down to a mushy mess I will have pulled mine up by then and put on the compost heap.I was happy with the results from my packet of Sutton   s borage seeds. They self set everywhere and have continued to do so for a couple of years. So even though they are an annual plant I have not needed to buy a new packet of seeds.*How do I use borage? I grow borage as it is a good attractant to bees; bees are necersary in the garden for pollination. I have occasionally used the young leaves in salads and I have used the flowers to make salads pretty and have frozen them in ice cubes to add to summer drinks. Borage flowers are traditionally added to pimms. I tried to candy the flowers once   brushing with egg white then dipping in sugar There are many recipes for using borage at http://www.herb.co.za/herbal/borage_more.htm*Taste  Well both the leaves and the flowers have a taste a bit like cucumber since I do not like cucumber I do not like the taste of borage much.I anticipate that because I sowed  some  Suttons  borage seeds and because they self set  so well I will have borage in the garden  for many years I could always  collect the seeds    from the plants and sow myself  where I want them to grow rather than the plants popping up   all over the garden .* I would recommend Suttons seeds if you wish to grow borage next year.      ::::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6239059:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5347743:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6838035:4:::6838035:4:::6506577:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6880805:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::5690767:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6866291:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6891381:4:::6891381:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6834688:4:::5816422:4:::6699566:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::6889871:4:::6889871:4:::6882537:4:::6882537:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5786498:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Salted Butter::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::14.08.2011::::    Tesco value butterI shall not be entering a discussion on wither eating butter is better /worse than eating margarine for information on this see http://lowfatcooking.about.com/od/faqs/f/buttermargarine.htm.In my family we eat both and we do both like a really creamy dairy butter, however to keep costs down I purchase Tesco value butter. We use the salted variety this value butter is also available unsalted I believe unsalted is cheaper.This butter is sold as a solid rectangular butter block measuring about   L11cm, xW9cm xH5cm.~Price When we  first started eating this butter it was a lot cheaper but now it costs    1.21 per 250g pack  to compare it to other 250g solid butters  lurpack cost    1.60  as does  Anchor butter. Yeo valley organic butter costs    1.50. Presentation.. The butter pat is enclosed in a thick greaseproof paper with the standard Tesco value blue and red packaging. I can remember my mum saving butter papers for lining her cake tins. I put the Tesco butter into my original Suffolk butter box it fits perfectly. I do leave the butter paper on unless we are having guests.~StorageI usually find the best before dates a satisfactory time from the date I purchase the butter. I store unopened packs in the fridge. Butter can be frozen too. When I am not using the butter  for a while or it is hot I will keep the opened in use pack in the fridge, however it usually resides on my kitchen table in the butter box as it is  easier to spread than when  removed from fridge just before use. Store butter in butter box as butter will pick up other flavours does not store it next to an onion or it will taste oniony. stored open for a long time it will taste rancid and not nice.~Looks This Tesco value rectangular butter pat is a light yellow colour.~Smell Not much very slight buttery creamy smell if you were blindfolded you would recognise it as butter. ~Texture soft, smooth, hardness depends on how cold/warm you keep it.  This butter melts well on crumpets or in a saucepan if you are using for a sauce melts well in a bowl over hot water or for a few seconds in the microwave.  Spread ability is good I have some flat   knives these are best.~Use Our Tesco value salted butter is mostly used on toast for breakfast or on crumpets, scones or toasted teacakes at afternoon tea. I have also used this butter when making shortbread or garlic or herb butter.  This value butter can be used to make sandwiches and for baking although for baking you might prefer to use the unsalted brand. For the limited baking that I use salted butter for I do not really notice the difference, if the recipe includes salt then I do not add it.~ Taste Mild buttery not very creamy but creamy enough. Does not taste of salt but the salt does enhances the butter taste, I suppose its what  suits you  which taste you get used to but I prefer salted butter  on toast. Salted butter has a longer shelf life than unsalted butter too. ~Availability Most Tesco shops  if not all  stock this butter or you can buy it on line http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk~Nutrition745kcal per 100g 2  salt yes it contains dairy milk so not good for dairy intolerance.

       " '5247778::::Trespass Antibacterial Travel Towel::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::13.08.2011::::    Trespass Large Antibacterial Travel Towel I had been thinking about buying a micro fibre  travel towel for a couple of years and when I was in Trespass shop a few weeks before going on holiday I found they were in the sale  so I purchase this large antibacterioral travel towel . The RRP is    17.99 I note today http://www.gapyeartravelstore.com they cost    14.99.This towel comes in a black carry case/bag this has a mesh side to let the air in. The case also has a short carry strap too. I had a choice between a pink or a light blue it   s also available in pink. I chose the blue I am not a great pink lover, nor is hubby.I chose a large bath towel size   75 x 130cm this is about the size of a standard bath towel, there is a smaller size available, but I do like a towel to wrap right around me after a shower or bath.This towel is a great size for taking with you when travelling it measures 20 x 12cm inside its case and it   s very lightweight. I wish these towels had been around in my backpacking hitchhiking youth they would have been ideal.Unpacking my towel for the first time I wondered how I would get on with it as I like a nice big fluffy bath towel to dry myself on.  Initially it did not feel a warm and cosy towel. This towel did not feel warm and cosy like a normal towel. The towel was soft though however I was please with how absorbent this towel was. It dried my body well quickly and it did absorb all the drips after my shower. After   I had used it, it did not feel too wet but I dried it on the washing line I had made out of string in the camp site. I showered in the morning and by the time I removed the towel from the line late afternoon it was dry, I used it some evenings and it was dry in the mornings too. We had a normal towel with us too and the microfibre one did dry quicker.This towel has an antibacterioral coating this prevents moulds and smells. I think that for a travel towel this is a good thing as I have know travel towels not getting dry properly and  being in  bags a lot of the time so not aired and they do get smelly. Read the washing instructions; wash on warm water any washing detergent except no bleach. Do not use fabric conditioner it will reduce the effectiveness of drying and I read that best washed apart from cotton fabric items, other towels that lose their fibres as the fibres will get stuck in the microfibres like lintI was very pleased with my purchase it was ideal for our camping holiday. This towel will also be good as  my swimming towel  small and light to carry to the pool and quick to dry afterwards I shall be looking around for another when they are in the sales .      ::::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6890814:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6800944:4:::6882156:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6699566:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5347743:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6239059:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Pasta Quills::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::12.08.2011::::    I like pasta meals they are tasty, quick and easy to cook. Unless I am using spaghetti I usually use Tesco value quills. Yesterday I bought some I looked on the pasta shelf and found the clear plastic bag containing  500g of pasta quills   a packet of these with red bold writing proclaiming PASTA QUILLS the blue Tesco value stripes were there too. This pack of pasta cost me the grand sum of 19p that   s 3.8 per 100g. These Tesco value quills are much like what is described as penne pasta, little tubes of pasta the ends cut in a diagonal.Looking along the shelf at other pasta I notice that even the other basic pasta   s cost more than twice as much.  You need between 75 and 100g of pasta per person for a meal so under 4p per person. This bag will feed 6 people.  This pasta can be used for with a variety of sauces home made or bought in a jar. This pasta with out sauce on tastes bland it   goes well with many flavoured sauces. To make a basic tomato sauce pasta meal from a jar you will need a 500g jar for 4 people.   To stretch the quantities of sauce add some vegetables or meat to the 500g of basic sauce. Most of the sauce jars have recipes on them. If you are making a  meal using a pesto sauce from a jar then add a couple of desert spoons of pesto per person   a 190 jar will make 4 servings . For home made pasta sauce recipes there are many recipes. A recipe book will have them in or look on line there are many pasta recipes   one example of a web site with many recipes suitable for this Tesco value pasta is http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/pastaI have now opened my pack of Tesco value pasta quills I have not used them all so I empty the remainder of the pack in to storage jar. You can just keep the remainder in the packaging it comes in, use a twist tie to seal the top but I find it   s easier and less messy in my store cupboard if I use a jar to store unused pasta in. I cook my Tesco pasta in a saucepan on the hob using about a litre of boiling water for a 100g of pasta. I do not add oil to my cooking pasta or salt some instructions for cooking do. I keep the water boiling well I do not put the lid on my saucepan. I stir the pasta frequently making sure it does not stick. In about 10 minutes the pasta quills are cooked. I like my al le dente soft but firm, If cooked too long it goes soggy. I usually taste test a piece before turning the heat off. I have my colander ready and strain the water away No need to rinse this pasta with water unless you are making a pasta salad with it then I will rinse with boiling water from my kettle.Now all I have to do is stir my sauce in and serve. I will often make up a larger quantity of sauce and pasta than I need and freeze for a night when I do not want to cook. It freezes fine.~NutritionThis Pasta is made with wheat it contains gluten. There are 348kcal per 100 gThese pasta quills are good they taste fine as good as some other more expensive ones.         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Don   t play with your food dear, well you can if it   s for a play activity not your dinner.  Playing with Pasta  Here are some ideas for an activity or two using Tesco value quills to entertain your children in the summer holidays.This value pasta is cheap so ideal for children   s sensory play.   It can be used cooked or uncooked, use it uncooked one day then cooked another. Cook it and the children can see the changes from soft to hard have both so they can compare, learning the science of the changes that are made if adding water.Put the pasta in a bowl or the water tray  give your child some containers some spoons  they can explore and fill and empty containers learning the maths language for full , empty , more , less. Pre School /early year   s children will play with pasta for ages. Extend the play by getting teddy or dolly and having a pasta picnic   teddy will happily eat dry pasta. (Your child will probably try it too)~Threading These quills are also ideal for threading and making necklaces. To  make these pasta quills coloured  just put the dried  pasta and add a few drops of colouring  into a   plastic bag or a bowl  either shake the bag or stir the pasta in the bowl and the  quills will pick up the colour.  . Let your child thread the pasta onto wool or shoelaces to make jewellery. If using wool wind some sellotape round the end to make the wool have a firm end its easier to thread.  ~Art  To make a picture using Tesco value quills all you need is some thick paper and some PVA glue let your child stick the paste coloured or uncoulred onto paper to make a picture.  Let your children play explore, experiment with this pasta learning and occupied~Added notes  + TasteThese pasta quills taste much like any other pasta bland maybe slightly wheaty. No real flavour so they go well with a stronger flavoured sauce.+ Texture The texture is much like other pastas , uncooked hard and brittle. Cooked depending on how long you cook it from al le dente to soggy and mushy. Better when cooked till its just soft about 10 mins     ::::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::5389183:3:::5389183:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6689426:4:::6657747:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5790028:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6190414:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6896441:4:::6896441:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6816341:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5347743:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6834688:4:::6891190:4:::6887156:4:::6699566:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5362774:4:::6844462:5:::6840867:5:::6840867:5:::6841809:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Kiwi Leather Instant Wax Shine::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::26.07.2011::::    I have used many Kiwi shoe polishing products today I used Kiwi instant wax shine for black leather on my shoes.This polish comes in a black plastic bottle 14cm tall 4 cm in radius containing 75ml.  This has a red collar on where the lid fits on. A picture of some shoes and instructions are written in white on the bottle and it sports the red KIWI logo.  This bottle is not completely cylindrical it is shaped well so I get a good grip on the bottle it   s easy to hold and apply the polish.I pull off the lid to this bottle and expose a two layered foam pad for applying the liquid polish to my shoes. I apply a little pressure to the pad against the shoes that I am polishing and the pad becomes engorged with polish. I have used this polish several times before and the foam pad still in good condition I have found some other makes where the foam applicator pads do not withstand many applications of polish to shoe and crumble...I invert the bottle and start polishing my shoe. The polish comes on to the applicator  pad in measured dosages  at a good rate it does not  pour out and over soak the pad but a little polish is dispensed on to the pad and I rub the foam pad over my shoes giving my shoes a good covering of polish. The polish is quite thick not thin and runny like another liquid shoe polish that I have used.This polish makes a good covering on my shoes and as it   s an instant shine it shines well without buffing.  I feel that this polish does protect and nourish my shoes well. I use this both on my best court shoes and my leather trainers and the results are good. Using this polish takes little effort not as much as using a solid polish and brush and with a busy lifestyle I find this a benefit.I have had trouble locating this polish for sale using the internet when I was price checking and wonder if it is available anymore. I found http://www.corporatestix.co.uk/ShopFront/upload/cleaning-products/kiwi-instant-wax-shine-black has some for    1.70Kiwi has been producing shoe polish in Melbourne Australia over 100years ago William Ramsay first produced polish and began hawking it about locally by horse and wagon locally. His business expanded and kiwi shoe polish sold in New Zealand and in 1912 arrived in England.I rate Kiwi shoe polishes good and like the instant wax shine one that I have been using good      ::::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6506577:4:::6838035:4:::6838035:4:::6841809:4:::5816422:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5255134:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6890814:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5347743:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::3957:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6145850:4:::6866291:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6693128:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6894799:4:::6894799:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6887858:4:::6699566:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840580:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Henry Watson Original Suffolk Butter Box::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::25.07.2011::::    I really like terracotta kitchen ware and have several items from, the original Suffolk range, ideal for use at home or on safari. I have had this Butter box for several years now. It is in use everyday, my husband does like a little bit of butter on his toast in the morning and I can not bear the sight of butter in its paper wrapping on the table. A 250 g pack of butter fits ideally into this butter box.  However I do leave the butter in my pot with its wrapper on saves the pot  getting greasy , this is unless I am serving  a  cream tea to guest with jam, cream and butter then I put the butter unwrapped in the pot it looks nicer.The inner of the pot is glazed so the butter is easy to wipe out and clean.The 250 g of butter fits snugly in the terracotta butter box. The box measures H6cm  L12cm , W9cm.This is a very attractive butterbox and is ideal for storing your butter in either the fridge or on the table .Mine goes in the fridge when it is very warm as the butter melts too much, however most of the time it is on the table butter at room temperature ready for spreading. The butter keeps well in this box. The terracotta is a warm brown colour very attractive. The terracotta pot is quite thick about     cm which makes it quite sturdy. The butterbox a classic design.One of the long sides has the same design on it as the other pots in the range. Some black swirl embellishments and the words Butter box and other detail written inside a space that is enclosed in a black line. The writing looks traditional and old.  This butterbox and the other terracotta Suffolk pottery items are ideal for a country style. There is a rectangular lid which fits snugly into recessed top of the butterbox this has a little pottery knob in the centre of it. I find the lid easy to put on and of the pot using this knob. Sadly I dropped the lid to my bvutterbox onto a hard floor and broke it cleanly in 2 so it was stuck together with glue it holds together fine after a couple of years.Yes I would recommend this item and the others from the original Suffolk potteries range.The RRP of this box is    19.75 you can buy it direct from http://www.henrywatson.com/retail-shop/collections/original-suffolk-terracotta /original-suffolk-terracotta-butter-boxI looked on line at the prices and Amazon is selling it for    19.50. most other on line shops were a similar price . I think this is a tad expensive, however it is good quality and things are expensive these days . I think it   s possible that you will be able to buy this in the high street from a good department store or shop that sells pottery; I think mine came from John Lewis many years ago.I have been very satisfied with  my Henry Watson  original potteries butterbox.     ::::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6874193:4:::6874193:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6145850:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6693128:4:::5347743:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6701923:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6894799:4:::6894799:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::3957:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6887858:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6834688:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6699566:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5439461:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Original Suffolk Terracotta Sugar Storage Jar::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::20.07.2011::::     Henry Watson   s, the original Suffolk potteries have been crafting pots since the early 19c. I have several of their Terracotta storage jars. I really like the look of terracotta. One of the jars that I have is the sugar one. I have owned my pot several years now and have had no problems with it.This jar   warm brown terracotta is a cylinder with a 1cm tall, 11cm in diameter. On the front   the traditional printing says Sugar and The original Suffolk potteries ideal for both home and safari are written in black the words are enclosed in a black oval line.  The top of the jar has a 1cm ridge the terracotta lid fits inside this. The lid which has a rounded knob in the centre has a rubber seal .When I push the lid onto my sugar jar it fits well. I had not realised till today I have a small chip in the kid , this does not seem to make mich difference to the pot though.The inside of the jar is glazed this helps keep moisture out and the sugar dry I have never had a problem with damp sugar inside this jar. The terracotta is very thick.When I open a new 1kg bag of sugar it is too much to fill the jar and I have to keep some in the bag with the top folded over.I really love my Henry Watson original Suffolk pottery jars that I have. This sugar jar looks smart enough to have on the tray with the cups/mugs when serving tea to guests.I just looked on  Amazon and this sugar jar costs    14.50 upwards http://www.legendcookshop.co.uk/henry-watson-range-kitchen-storage-cannisters/ is selling for    14.29. I Think I bough mine at John Lewis but that was many years ago.I really like my sugar jar it looks good and keeps my sugar dry and fresh.

       " '5247778::::SuperCook Baking Cases::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::18.07.2011::::    Supercook was bought out by Dr Oetker a few years ago and now all Supercook products go by the name Dr Oetker. When I looked on line to get the correct price for these supercook /Dr Oetker paper cases I notice on my supermarket it calls them supercook paper cases but the picture shows the packaging as Dr Oetker. When I type Supercook into my search engine the second site listed is Dr Oetker with the www address http://www.oetker.co.uk/oetker_uk/html/default/homeNow I have bought this product both when it was labelled Supercook and recently when labelled Dr Oetker the product identical not updated just the packaging.There are 100 cake cases in the firm clear see through plastic resealable packaging which now has a Dr Oetker label strip wrapped around the lid.These 100 cake cases cost 55p at the moment in Tesco. These cake cases are for little fairy cakes not the bigger cup cakes or the smaller petit four cases.These paper cases are a plain white not coloured or pattered you pay a bit more for coloured and pattered cake cases. These paper cases are made from a quality baking paper.  This paper is fairly thick it fits into a standard bun baking space superbly.These cake cases stay in shape when cake mix is put into them and baked.When the little cakes removed from the bun tray with these on them it is easier to wash the bun tray. The cake cases are fine to be kept on for serving them you could take them of but that   s not so usual. These cake case come  away from the cake easily rarely do I find cake left stuck inside one some times the cases leave a little ridged effect to the cake edges where the cases have been taken off.I have made a variety of cake mixes and used these cake cases all results good.These cake cases are easy to remove from the little cake, I have had to help some young children remove them though.Would I recommend these ? yes     ::::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6781956:3:::5790028:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::6701923:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6752066:3:::6752066:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6728386:4:::6728386:4:::5295842:4:::5295842:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6841809:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6891190:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6866291:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5203100:4:::6889612:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5362774:4:::5347743:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6887156:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6887858:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pyrex 2.0L Round Casserole::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::17.07.2011::::    Amongst my many Pyrex dishes I have this 2 litre casserole dish I have owned it for more years than I can remember.I often use this dish it is ideal for a casserole for 4-6 people.  The width 22.5cm the depth 13.4 cmThis round dish with two lip handles either side has a lid with two matching handles. These handles do make lifting the casserole out of the freezer easy. The lid fits loosely. The dish is made from clear Borosilicate glass (Borosilicate glass was first discovered in Germany in the late 18c and Pyrex was introduced in1915 by American firm Corning Pyrex now made by Arc International) This Pyrex glass is tough stuff I have dropped it and knocked it about not deliberately and not on very hard surfaces and it has not broken. Pyrex has a manufacturers  guarantee of 10 years(not against dropping probably) I have  Pyrex  dishes which are over 30 years old some inherited from my mother and they are still going strong.I can/and do use my 2 litre casserole dish in my microwave, its ideal for putting things in to defrost, or to reheat. I use my casserole dish to cook casseroles in the oven; I put a bacon joint in it to roast sometimes. The Pyrex 2 litre casserole dish will withstand heat to a 300 degrees C. After cooking that delicious casserole in it you can take the dish straight from oven to table (remember to put a mat ready to receive it) I find the food in it retains its temperature quite a time. I have sometimes frozen a meal in this dish as it is freezer safe. After serving my casserole from this Pyrex dish I often put it in to soak in water it makes washing up easier, if you have a dishwasher it is safe to wash it in here.I do not find washing up this Pyrex dish hard, it does not stain or retain flavours so the sweet desert cooked after a curry will not be tainted.   This 2 litre Pyrex casserole dish can be bought  in many shops as part of a graded casserole set or individually . At http://store.makro.co.uk/p-8814-pyrex-round-casserole-dish-2-litre.aspx    it costs 11.99. At http://www.wilkinsonplus.com/oven-to-tableware/pyrex-classic-casserole-dish-clear-2ltr/invt/0950840/ it costs    8.00I would certainly recommend this dish, ideal as a wedding present and ideal for those going into self catering accommodation at UNI this SeptemberEuropean Pyrex is still made of Borosilicate glass North American Pyrex is made of tempered soda lime glass composite. I have no experience of the soda lime glass to compare.Thanks for reading, Mary     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6728386:4:::6728386:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6866291:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::3957:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6826738:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6880805:4:::5552133:4:::5552133:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6657747:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6823885:4:::6823885:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6735325:4:::6840580:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6830048:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6887858:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6889612:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6699566:4:::5362774:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Firethorn (syn. Saphyr Red)::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::16.07.2011::::    Fire thorn is the common name for Pyracantha, if you have ever got a thorn from one stuck in your finger you will understand why they are called Firethorn.There are many species of the Firethorn/Pyracantha shrub some producing yellow berries some orange some red.I have several Pyracantha/Firethorn bushes in the borders edging my garden I am not sure which species they are they seem to be different varieties some producing a red berry one an orange berry. Previous owners of my house and garden planted them. This shrub is a long lived one ours well over 25 years old. I suspect one is the sapphire red species the description I have read on line seems to fit it.*Flowers All of the firethorns produce a white flower. Mine flowers in May to June. The Firethorn flower grows in clusters they are simple small 5 petaled flowers. I have not noticed my flower   s attracting butterflies but they do attract bees and a few other insects. The flowers are individually unremarkable to look at but in mass over the bush look very attractive. On mine the flowers just finished and the berries beginning to form.The berries will be at their best in the autumn.*BerriesI prefer the red berried varieties of the Firethorn/Pyracantha I like their bold colour and from their performance in the garden I think the birds prefer the red berries too.The Firethorn is a really good bird bush as the birds especially the blackbird, really love the berries and some birds will nest in them. I am not sure which birds will nest in the firethorn but I do know that when pruning a couple of times I have found nests in among the twigs.I have a fairly tall pyracantha in the front garden and I frequently see birds  just sitting on the twiggy branches pecking at a few insects, eating the berries or just using it as a viewpoint. The berries on my Firethorn hang on for a long time , if the birds let them and I have seen birds at the berries in the snow.I had not previously thought about eating the berries myself but read today that although bitter they can be used to make a jelly see http://www.howtogrow.co.uk/recipe-pyracantha-jelly.html*LeavesThe Firethorn is evergreen it leaves are small green and shiny. *Pruning If it had not been raining today I was going to go and gently prune, tidy up my Firethorn in the front garden as the new growth is making it look straggly. I shall prune the  straggly twigs  just to a few mm above where I can see the flowers have been and the berries  beginning to form pruned back any harder I shall lose the red berry show in the autumn. I expect to prune my Firethorn/ Pyracantha again in August. So I can see the red berries well. I shall if necessary seriously prune the Firethorn in the winter to make it bushier.Next years flowers and fruit appear on the previous year   s growth so I shall be careful not to prune this year   s growth too much.However a good hard prune will not do the shrub any harm I needed to give the firethorn hedge at the bottom of the garden a good prune, cutting it back hard. This affected its flowering and fruiting but invigorated and tidied up the hedge. When pruning a firethorn it is best to wear good thick gardening gloves as the thorns are long and prickly I got one embedded in my thumb one, it hurt and was difficult to remove.*Position, care and use Firethorn can be grown as stand alone shrub but usually grown as a hedge. They like full sun or partial shade. Sapphire red grows well as a hedge.My hedge of about 4 shrubs at the boundary fence at the bottom of the garden is a fierce thorney one this is a really good defender fence against any Scallies who might try and get into my garden this way. So it is an ideal shrub to grow as a hedge along a boundary where you are concerned that intruders might get in. The Firethorn can be grown as a hedge or can be grown against a wall, trellis or fence. It really is a hardy shrub. Few diseases will affect it. Firethorns can grow up to 4 metres high this does depend on the variety. Sapphire red grows to 250cm   s The Firethorn grows well on most soils I have a well drained chalky soil. Best planted in the October but if pot grown can be planted at other times of the year. I do very little to look after mine it   s a hardy shrub. Suited to exposed or sheltered positions.*Propagation and buying new plants. Although I never have done this the   firethorn can be grown from cuttings see http://www.pyracantha.co.uk/pyracantha-cultivation/how-to-take-pyracantha-cuttingsCan also be grown from seed I have dug up several small trees from the garden where berries have fallen and they have self set. There are many small Pyracantha plants for sale at http://www.hedgenursery.co.uk/browse/all-pyracantha-hedging-4734/?gclid=CO-Xlcr1haoCFYUY4QodUxE7yg including the sapphire red.

The recycled warehouse makes these storage jars in 0.25 litre 0.5 litre, 1 litre and 1.5 litre capacity sizes.These jars are made of a green tinged recycled glass; the glass itself is a thick glass which is ideal for storage jars. These jars are cuboids they are flat sided the top of the jars has a slightly sloping shoulder and a circular lipped opening 8.1/2 cm in diameter. Into this circular hole fits a cork lid 2.1/2 cm in thickness. This cork fits the hole snugly.I think these jars are attractive I have them on my kitchen windowsill. Inside I store tea and teabags, but they could be used to store a variety of things.A set of 3 0.25 litres sized ones cost    8.34. The size that I have costs      .12.51 for 3 the 1 litre set of 3 costs    16.48 a single 1.5 litre jar costs    8.34. The recycleware house also sells several other recycled glass jars and objects in fact it sells many items for the household, office, personal and domestic products made from recycled materials.The glass jars are quite sturdy do not chip easily. With a large opening they are easy to wash and clean I really like green recycled glass not just ascetically but also because it is recycled using old unwanted or broken glass. I do not know if these can be washed in the dishwasher I do not own a dishwasher so it did not concern me.  see the website http://www.therecyclewarehouse.com/epages/es115204.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/es115204_es122396924382/Categories/ 22Dining/Kitchen 22/ 22Storage 20Jars 22     ::::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6145850:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5646482:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6843584:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6657747:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6846862:3:::6846862:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6824315:3:::6824315:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6691451:3:::6895012:3:::6895012:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6757811:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6654507:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5805376:4:::6880805:4:::6781956:4:::6866291:4:::6850650:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6506577:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6878095:4:::5347743:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6292077:4:::5203100:4:::6887156:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6689426:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6830048:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Suttons Lemon Coriander Seeds - Herb Seeds (Culinary)::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::11.07.2011::::    I noticed some Suttons lemon coriander seeds in the shop when I was buying some ordinary coriander seeds. Since my husband loves coriander I thought I would give them a try. These seed   s cost    1.69. There are 100 seeds in the packet, no I did not count them but Suttons say there are 100 in the pack. The packet measuring 13cm x 7cm is a foil lines one to keep the seeds in good condition. A picture of the coriander seeds is on the front sowing instructions on the back. These lemon coriander seeds can either be grown outside in April or May at a depth of 6-13mm, or in a pot for the window sill.I like a few herbs on my window sill where I can pick them and put in my cooking pot easily.So I sowed some of the small seeds thinly in a pot and watered them. They germinated in 10 days. Coriander likes the sun; my window is a sunny one. By about 3 weeks I was seeing small dainty leaves not big enough to use yet.  Cropping time is about 28 days after sowing.I watered them well and we went away for a week while we were away the water dried up and the plants grew tall and the leaves stayed small. I put the pots out in my garden and watered them, sadly to say I forgot to keep watering them and they shot up flowered a small umbel of flowers which quickly went to seed Sadly I was unable to harvest enough lemon coriander leaves to use in my cooking. I still have plenty of seeds to try again. If I am growing them in the house I can sow the seeds at any time. Sutton,s seeds are usually very reliable so I think it was mt care rather than the seed   s.The reason my lemon coriander crop failed was due to lack of water, when a plant lacks water it races on to seed if it can. However I did sniff my Lemon coriander and yes it smelt vaguely of lemons, still of coriander too. I did taste the smallest amount and it did have a citrus lemon flavour. From the flavour I detected I think that the Lemon coriander herb will go well with a salad I think a cous cous dish would be good with this coriander or with a chicken dish. Coriander is often used in recipes with lemon so I think that one of these recipies and omit the lemon.Anyway wish me luck with my next planting.     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6701923:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6506577:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6654507:4:::6779046:4:::6779046:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6751010:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6657747:4:::5347743:4:::5203100:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6887858:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6829585:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6841809:4:::6830048:4:::6816341:4:::6887156:4:::6866291:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bizzy Bee Non Scratch Scourers::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::10.07.2011::::    I needed a new scourer as my old one had gone manky so I looked in my cupboard to find a new one. I had a pack of 2 bizzybee non scratch antibacterial scourers.I bought mine from Sainsbury   s they cost    1.15 they are also available at ocado for    1.42. I sometimes use similar Spontex scourers which cost    1.10,Two of these scourers are packaged together in a card wraparound which has info on use printed on it. The bizzy bee logo of a bee buzzing on a flower is printed on the packaging. These scourers 12cmx2.5cmx 8cm are a good size to hold in the hand and scrub a pan. I am holding one in my hand it is squashy. I can feel the rough scouring exterior of this pad although it does not feel too abrasive. One of the reasons why I bought these scourers is because they are effective on non stick pans .I use wire wool /brillo pads on the barbecue. I own several non stick baking and cooking pans which do get fat burnt on and I also have pans which do not have a non stick surface.I have used them on metal baking trays, on pyex dishes, ceramic dishes and on barbecue tongsI find these bizzybee scourers effective on both to scour the residue fat with a bit of effort rubbing and on scratching away at the burnt on fat it will come away. I dampen my scourer and have on occasion on really burnt on pans also use a cream cleaner on it.I find these pads really effective on anything but the worst burnt on left on grease. After use I will rinse my scourers if they are not too claggy and I will reuse them many times. I also wash these in the washing machine they come up well.These bizzy bee non scratch scourers also have an antibacterial agent in them to inhibit bacteria growing and help them last longer. I have previously bought these scourers and being happy with them have bought more to use; yes I think they are good. My daughter washing up for me yesterday said Bizzy bee I use them too I think they are good.     ::::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6781956:4:::6893918:4:::6893918:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5347743:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6800944:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6892298:4:::6892298:4:::6845486:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6657747:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6829585:4:::6866291:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::5722409:4:::6691451:4:::6689426:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5362774:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6844462:4:::6751010:4:::5203100:4:::5790028:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6887858:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6887156:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The only thing I knew really was the rhyme in the Owl and the pussycat where They dined on mince and slices of quince,Which they ate with a runcible spoon;I suppose they were really dining on the fruit from the other tree rather than the flowering Quince.If our Quince is anything to go by then it is a very hardy tree ours is in a very poor chalk soil right against the wall of the house, it gets very little loving care. The twiggy branches have fierce thick prickly thorns. I think theer are varieties without thorns.In April-may before the leaves appear the blossom flowers it   s a very pretty dark pink flower about 5cm in circumference. Quince flowers can be  white or pink through to red in colour depending on species. I find bees are attracted to the quince flowerThe glossy green leaves appear just as the flowers are finishing. The leaves on my tree often fall or go brown due to disease. In autumn they turn red.The flowering quince fruit like the Quince fruit is a cross between an apple and a pear it takes a long while to ripen and is edible however it does not taste good uncooked. The fruit is green and ripens to a yellow.The fruit takes a long time o develop and ripen as late as October for a really ripe fruit,  I have both tasted my quince raw and cooked. Raw they are not very exciting I did not like the taste it is possible that the quince I ate was not especially ripe though. I tried cooking them, not much success here either.They smell pleasant though.A Quince is self pollinating so does not need another tree nearby to help it produce fruit.The Quince blossoms are very pretty but if I were to want a tree in my garden I do not think that Quince would be my first choice.  .Seehttp://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/29/nigel-slater-recipes-quince A plant will cost you    7.50 at http://www.hedgenursery.co.uk     ::::6890814:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6781956:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6265842:3:::6265842:3:::6834688:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6887858:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6866291:4:::5203100:4:::6841809:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5262587:4:::5262587:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6844462:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Kitchen Foil::::House & Garden::::30::::very helpful::::07.07.2011::::    I have10 metres of 45cm wide kitchen foil in my kitchen I bought it in a roll from Tesco. It is not very often that I do not have any foil in my kitchen ready for use.This roll of foil comes in a car box, when opened there is a fairly sharp serrated cutting edge.When I unwind as much  foil from  the roll as I need  I fold it over the serrated edge and quickly tear it, It usually makes a good straight tear in the foil and I can remove the piece that  I need.This foil has a shiny side and a dull matt side, now which side do I put   facing inwards which outwards? Well I usually put the shiny side facing outwards. I did look up which side of foil to use a long time ago and the difference in cooking times and finish is minimal so really it makes little if any difference.I use this Tesco kitchen foil when I am cooking. The last time I used any was last weekend when we had a barbecue I used some to make a parcel of mushrooms,   I also wrapped some tomatoes in Tesco   s foil to barbecue. I have also wrapped bananas in foil which I had cut a slit in then inserted chocolate in.I use Tesco   s kitchen foil when I roast a chicken or turkey. I wrap fish in it to cook. I find wrapping in foil a good way to roast a garlic head. I find cooking in foil clean as the fat does not spray all over the oven and the pan I have cooked in is not as dirty. Tesco foil stops the skin of meats burning but removes the foil for     to     hour before end of cooking to allow skin to go brown.I have used greased foil to line cake tins with if I think the   outer cake might burn.I have occasionally used this foil to wrapp sandwiches inand wrapp foods that I put in the fridge.You can also use Tesco kitchen foil for some easy children   s art project I have made foil people and animals with children using the instructions at http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/the-foil-family-66628*Never use foil in the microwave. I find Tesco kitchen foil as good as many other foils that I have used. The price is    2.60 for the 10 metres of 45cm width size Asda and Ocado price for the same sized foil in their shops is the same. Tesco also sell this kitchen foil in a 30cm width size this costs     1.43     ::::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6701923:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6844462:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6145850:4:::6800944:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6845486:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5805376:4:::6190414:4:::6743330:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::5690767:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6840580:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6880488:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::5347743:4:::5203100:4:::6292077:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5790028:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6239059:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6866291:4:::6880805:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6829585:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6893925:4:::6893925:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pyrex Classics Measure Jug::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::05.07.2011::::    Pyrex Classic Measuring Jug 1ltI have written a review previously about my smaller Pyrex jug, but today I am reviewing my larger 1 litre jug. This jug is made of thick heat resistant see through clear Pyrex glass. It is dumpy in shape not tall and slim measuring 15cm in diameter at the top 12 cm diameter at the base so the sides to slope outwards a little. It measures 10     cm tall. The thick glass handle is a hooked one it is easy to hold. There is a small pouring spout opposite the handle. It pours well not dribbling. On one side of the jug there is red writing on a gauge showing marks measuring200ml300ml, 400ml, 600 ml 700ml, 8ooml, 900ml 1 litre. These marks have the numerals written on every 200. There are also pint measurements too up to 1     pints the pint gauge has 8fl oz,     12fl oz 16floz, 1 pint 24 and 26 fl oz then 1     pints measured  . I find this measuring jug useful when I want to measure these quantities. As I am usually cooking for 2 I find the smaller pyrex jug the most usefukk . When thev family comes I frequentkyg use this larger 1 litre jug. I use this jug in the microwave to make custard, or reheat soups. I use it when I am scrambling eggs. I use it to cook frozen vegetables I use it for cooking many thing in the oven.Pyrex  glassware is very hard wearing the glass dores not discilour much , it shows no scratches. Pyrex glass is hard to break . I have dropped my pyrex several times and it has not briken ,  probsavlrb differeny if dropped  onto a congreteIexpect my Pyrex rto lsft many years.There are many kitchen and cookware items made of Pyrex glass. These jugs are great  if you were buying a wedding present I would recommend them    .

       " '5247778::::Tesco Greaseproof Paper::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::04.07.2011::::    Greaseproof paper is a paper that will not let grease or oil through it. It is ideal for use when baking, which is where I use it. At the moment I have a roll of Tesco   s greaseproof paper. This paper is on a roll inside a brown box.  When the box is opened length ways one edge is serrated top make it easier to tear the paper in a straight line. The roll is 37.5cm wide and 20metres long. This will last me a long time There is no inner card roll as there is with foils.This paper is suitable for use in freezers fridges, microwave and oven. I use my greaseproof paper to line cake tins if I am making a large fruit cake or other large cakes. I line the cake tin with greaseproof paper then brush oil on the paper. This prevents cake sticking to the tin and makes it easier to remove the cake from the tin without damaging it. When the greaseproof paper comes away from the tin stuck on the cake it is easy to peel the paper off. If I pre make a quantity of pancakes then I separate them with circles of greaseproof paper which I have cut out. Mum used to cut out circles of greaseproof paper to put on top of her home made jam.Greaseproof paper is ideal for wrapping greasy foods such as bacon or cheese. Last week I baked a cake in a tin which I had lined with Tesco greaseproof paper. The cake did not stick to the tin and came out easily. The greaseproof paper was easy to remove by just pulling it away from the cake. I then disposed of the paper in the rubbish binI have used greaseproof paper at work in the children   s art covering shapes of greaseproof paper with tissue to make stained glass effect pictures. See http://artykids.wordpress.com/category/colours/page/5/ for the idea we used. Tesco greaseproof paper is as good as any other that I have used. It costs    1.46 for the 20 meter roll.      ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6846862:3:::6846862:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6145850:4:::5347743:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6800944:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6759284:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6841809:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6887858:4:::6735325:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6892298:4:::6892298:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6728386:4:::6728386:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::6751010:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6866291:4:::5203100:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Red Valerian is a Perennial and will last for many years.Roots The valerian has strong fleshy tap roots which will go very woody with age.  Leaves and stem Tall smooth stems grow and pointy oval leaves grow in pairs of the stem. Many small bright red florets are produced at the top of the plant. These sprays of flowers resemble lilac to look at. A mound of this plant can measure 75-80cm wide and produce many flowering stems*FlowerMany small bright red florets are produced at the top of the plant. These sprays of flowers resemble lilac to look at.This can be a tall plant growing to 80cm tallThe flowering time is May till August. Mine have been flowering quite a time now in fact some have gone to seed. Red valerian self seeds fairly easily I am sure some of my plants are self set.*Scent I just got down having a sniff and they do not smell over attractive, the smell is a bit rank a bit earthy.*Position.Valerian grows well in my chalk soil. It also used to grow quite well in Dads clay soil. I have often seen red valerian its seeds escaped from gardens along walls or hedges it seems to survive well and be a hardy plant liking a poor soil.*Availability You will find this plant for sale in most garden centres off and off line. You can buy either he plant or the seeds. The time to grow from seed is March AprilAt http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk a pack of 3 pants in 9cm pots can be bought for    9.95 the seeds can be bought from http://www.greenchronicle.co.uk for 99p. Valerian seeds are available from most seed merchantsValerian is a native of the Mediterranean and has been introduces and naturalised in many other countries.Sometimes this plant is called Jupiter s beard.*why I grow red valerian This is quite an attractive bright coloured plant ideal for the back of the border. Red valerian attracts butterflies, bees and other insects; they feed on the nectar and pollinate the plant. I have a wildlife garden and use as many nectar rich flowers as I can to attract butterflies.This plant has attracted a few butterflies in my garden to feed on it not many but enough to make it worth having. We have seen Ringlet butterflies, on it and other species too.

       " '5247778::::MV Sports In the Night Garden Iggle Piggle Tri Scooter::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.06.2011::::    A good condition second hand tri scooter featuring Iggle Piggle and the night garden was donated to my class of 5/6 year olds. The children love it. This toy is played with everyday by   those few students in my class (I work with special needs children) who can scoot and it frequently disappears when another classroom borrow it at their playtime.This tri scooter is suitable for over 3 year olds I would put 6 or7 years as the oldest. Depending on your individual   s child   s size and abilities of course.The maximum weight this scooter can bar is 20kto g. so not for me to zoom around the playground on.The handle bars are adjustable to a height from 62cm -68cmThis scooter new comes with a little back pack featuring Iggle piggle and a squeaker we do not have this previous owner did not pass it on to us.  The handle bars have two orange soft handgrips on them; these are fixed fairly firmly on. The frame of this scooter is steel it is covered a pale blue colour which has a few in the night garden transfers on it. The stem of the handle bar will twist from left to right making the scooter steerable. Alo The upper section of the stem fits into the lower section; it is here you can change the height of the steering column. The steering column goes down to the single front wheel this has an orange inner and blue    tyres    these tyres are non blow up ones, they are solid The flat footplate is orange and has in the night garden pictures on it the footplate is from an anti slip PP- propylene. The two back wheels are fitted to the back. My children at school get lot of fun from this scooter.  It has 3 wheels so it is good for children who have not yet got good balance and are learning.

       " '5247778::::Frank Coopers Original Coarse Cut Seville Orange Marmalade::::Food & Drink::::20::::very helpful::::26.06.2011::::    Frank Coopers Original Coarse Cut Seville orange MarmaladeFor breakfast I will sometimes eat toast and marmalade. The jar we have opened at the moment is Frank Cooper   s Original Oxford marmalade.I notice that once opened this jar has to be refrigerated and eaten within 6 weeks. Ours does get refrigerated but I never remember when I open them, I suppose I ought to put a sticker on it with the date. If I was to store this jar unopened that I bought last month (May 2011) it has a good best before date on it of April 2013. This Frank Coopers original course cut Oxford marmalade comes in a squat glass jar containing 454g. This jar is sealed with a tight fitting gold coloured metal lid. The label with Frank coopers logo looks traditional and old fashioned, gives the impression that you are buying a traditional good marmalade.This marmalade is on sale today at Asda for    1.44 Tesco and Ocado for    1.49, Sainsbury   s for    1.62. To compare price at Tesco with other brands    1 Hartley s Olde English Thick Cut Marmalade costs    1.35, Duerrs costs    1.17 Tesco own label thick cut costs 61p. Now to spread some on my toast and tasteHaving undone the tight lid I get an orange smell. I put my knife into the dark golden coloured marmalade. The marmalade was very thick with lots of thick uneven roughly cut pieces of Seville orange skin in it. Putting some onto my toast the gel of the marmalade spread fine but there were so many thick shreds they were difficult to distribute easily over the toast.Now to taste, this is a very bitter sour tasting marmalade not over sweet. Husband although not liking sweet things found it to bitter and refused to eat it. I however plodded on, it really was like eating a sour maybe not quite ripe orange it was a very strong flavour. I was not over keen on it really. However if you like a bitter marmalade try this one.There are 272 kcal per 100g 15g is what they reckon will spread on a slice of toast that   s 42kcalNot being one to throw food away I shall cook with it. I shall make a marmalade cake and an apple and marmalade tart as using it with other flavours should take the bitterness away from it and disperse the huge chunks of peel throughout the baking.

       " '5247778::::Tomy One Water Whistler::::Family::::30::::very helpful::::25.06.2011::::    Its summer time, time for those paddling pools to appear in the garden. This Tomy water whistler toy is suitable for both bath and paddling pool; we have two for the school swimming pool. This toy is suitable for a child aged over 18 months.This water whistler from Tomy is a soft rubbery dolphin. It is available in blue or pink. This rounded cute looking dolphin with big black eyes has a bow tie the pink one is a purple blue, the blue dolphin has a yellow bow tie. The water whistler and squirter at the base and in their mouths are matching colours The dolphin is about 14cm long. It is a good grab size .It feels soft and rubbery. This dolphin is easy to squeeze. When placed in the water for play the Dolphin will float. So here we have a science lesson and opportunity to learn the word floating and its meaning.While floating this dolphin will squeak a little like real dolphins do. When your child grabs it and squeezes it will squirt water from its mouth, it actually produces quite a good jet of water. I have had fun in the swimming pool both squirting the children with this and also being squirted back. The children do like and play with this toy.Unfortunaly the round plastic fitting that fits in the base and helps the squeaking and squirting had come out. However I suspect that at home this toy would not get as much or as rough use so it would last longer than our school ones have.We still use the broken ones in the pool though they keep floating along.Ours at work is a couple of years old now and the rubbery plastic not deteriorated, the colours a little faded but that   s all.Tomy is a firm that has been producing toys for 80 years now I have seen and played with many Tomy products.This dolphin water whistler cost    5.99 I have seen it on line in both blue and pink from    4.49 at http://www.amazon.co.uk most retailers seem to have it for just over the    5. mark.I think this may be just a little too expensive.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6890749:4:::6890749:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6880805:4:::5347743:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5790028:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6292077:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6834688:4:::6887858:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6866291:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5808829:4:::6878095:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5816422:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Cookingtime Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller::::House & Garden::::20::::very helpful::::21.06.2011::::    I have been trawling through the kitchen utensil category, to find if there were any items that I own to give my opinion on. Lo and behold I found this Strawberry huller. Since we are in Strawberry season I thought a review on this item would be helpful.I did not buy mine but was given it from my mum.  This is not a very expensive gadget http://www.cookingtime.co.uk are selling it for 75p I expect you can buy it in department stores or cookery utensil shops.This Strawberry huller is basically a small thin piece of stainless steel which has been bent in half to make a small pincher, tong like tool. It measures about 3 cm wide by 5.8 cm long. The words stainless steel is inscribed on this huller. The ends of the huller are rounded and there is a circular indentation in the ends with ridges on. These are for putting your thumb and finger on to grip the Strawberry huller. The hull of the strawberry is the leafy top of the strawberry; this has a white core which attaches to the strawberry.To serve or cook with strawberries this is removed. I am quite experienced at hulling strawberries. I used to live near a field where I strawberry picked and my parents also grew strawberries. I would sit on the lawn in the summer and hull the strawberries for mum so that she could jam, or freeze them. This I did with my thumb and finger or with a sharp knife. Quite a simple if tedious occupation.Why I should have been given a Strawberry huller by mother is beyond me I expect she thought it a novelty and might be handy.Now to use the metal huller I would have a bowl of strawberries   by my side and a bowl or piece of paper to put the hull pieces on. Now gently holding the strawberry by one thumb and finger, the strawberry huller held by the thumb and finger on the other hand, I put the curved edges around the green top of the hull close to the strawberry, then twist and pull. Hopefully this will remove the green leaves and the white core leaving a small round hole in the top of the strawberry..Personally I did not find this huller easy to use, it did not always easily remove those green leaves and hull completely, I found I would often leave the green and the core in the strawberry. The ripest strawberrires were the best to dehull. After a while I would find gripping the stainless steel grip ridges with my fingers uncomfortable.I no longer hull the amount of strawberries I used to as a child and a teenager so really do not need a tool to help me.I no longer use this strawberry huller, in fact I have no idea where it is I rummaged in my kitchen draw but have not found it.I notice on line that there are other similer strawberry hullers where you pinch, pinch twist  the strawberry hull and I have used one, however I have found them pretty hopeless. HoweverI have used a different type of huller which you simply inserting a point into the stem at the top and twisting to remove this get s better results.   I still prefer to use just my fingers and occasionally a knife.You can find this strawberry huller at http://www.cookingtime.co.uk for other styles of strawberry hullers just type strawberry huller into your search bar     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6728386:4:::6728386:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6880805:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6145850:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6190414:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5805376:4:::6887858:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6816341:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830048:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5203100:4:::6890814:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6657747:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6866291:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6829585:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::6850502:5:::6850502:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Canon LP-E6 Lithium Ion::::Cameras::::40::::very helpful::::19.06.2011::::    Rechargeable Battery LP-E6, for the Canon 5D Mark 11 and 7D camerasCanon (and other camera manufacturers), frequently build equipment with a unique fitting so that if you can   t use parts made by rival manufacturers. This includes the rechargeable batteries. So on buying new 5D cannon camera new batteries and charger had to be bought.. Rechargeable batteries are quite frequently suitable for a limited number of cameras; and you have little choice but to fit the manufacturers own brand as the connectors and housing for the battery are formed to prevent other very similar looking batteries being used. No DSLRs and very few compact cameras will accept    standard    batteries, so if you upgrade your camera and want a spare battery you are forced to buy a specific model (though you may already have apparently similar batteries, previously purchased but now incompatible, in other cameras). This battery, the  LP-E6 battery  is for  the 2 Canon cameras (EOS 5D Mark 11 and 7D)  This battery as with many  rechargeable batteries has a specific shape and connector arrangement, so it needs a purpose built chargers the chargers come in 2 versions the LC-E6 (American model) and LC-E6e (European model with detachable mains cable). The LP-E6 battery doesn   t fit the recharging unit in the way you intuitively expect. It doesn   t slide in from one end but has to be positioned very close to its connectors and then pushed down into the recharge unit before being slid the last 2 or 3 millimetres into place. This is fiddly and can be frustrating on first use. While it could be argued that the design of the housing and connectors might well have been made compatible with the batteries from earlier Canon cameras (and easier to fit to the charger), this LP-E6 battery is capable of a longer life and permits very rapid firing of the camera. Previous batteries might provide a less satisfactory experience. It is possible to buy Chinese mimic versions of the LP-E6 battery for approx 1/3rd of the price of the original Canon battery. I haven   t tried one but a quick scrutiny of the manufacturer   s description suggests that they hold a slightly lower charge and deliver a slightly different current, and some do not    talk    with the camera about the amount of charge being held. Various forums discuss the merits of saving    30 by buying these cheaper versions and most discussions have a mix of     mine seems to work fine    through to     waste of money gave up after 3 recharges   , with the predominant opinion being that Canon overcharge for their undeniably superb and safer bet of a batteryThis battery   s Dimensions are  (W x H x D):38.4 x 21 x 56.8 mm Weight (Approx.): 80g.

       " '5247778::::Nestle Aero Bubbly Lamb::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::16.06.2011::::    Nestle chocolate lamb. I bought several Easter treats for my grandchildren, and this lonely little lamb got forgotten in my cupboard until today when I decided I was in need of a chocolate fix. *SizeThis chocolate lamb weighs 25g measures 6cm x 4cm it is about 2cm thick at the largest points this chocolate is shaped so in reality it is not as big as it sounds The RRP of this chocolate bubbly lamb is 62P         A 49G bar of CDM will cost 56P. Still we all know Easter shaped chocolate is expensive.*AppearanceLooking at this lamb it really is quite attractive its little feet at the bottom lots of bubbly chocolate to represent its woolly coat, then   a smiling little smooth chocolate face with 2 eyes and a mouth indented. I expect there is a large run of trays of sheep molds  which  molton chocolate is poured into by a machine  before the chocolate  sheep cool and  then packed in  foil backed plastic wrapper with the picture of the sheep on it.I bit mine in half so I could describe the interior. Yes it is bubbly small bubbles just like a large aero.*Aroma.As soon as I opened the packing I could smell a lovely chocolate smell.*Nutrition.All the nutritional info is on the back of the pack. It is a milk chocolate. With no artificial colours, but it may contain traces of nut. There are 145kcal per lamb.-Ingredients areSugar, dried whole milk, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, vegetable fat, lactose   proteins from whey, whey powder, emulsifier (Soya lecithin), butterfat, flavouring*Taste.A good Dairy milk chocolate taste, smooth and creamy a good chocolate, but not terrific. Yes I enjoyed eating this Nestle Aero bubbly lamb. It took me all of 5 bites to eat it. I do not think this lamb is available in the other Aero flavours.*AvailabilityWell if you had wanted this lamb in January this year you would have been able to purchase it. I have looked on line today and note that the sites and supermarkets no longer have it available. I notice a few bulk buy sites say they have them, but I bet when you look further they do not. I suppose you might find some in a small corner shop somewhere. I am sure that once we get Christmas 2011 over with these cute little lambs will become available again. *Will I buy one next year? I doubt that I will be buying one as I think that they are expensive for a small amount of chocolate     ::::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6829585:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6161004:4:::6161004:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6878095:4:::5805376:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5203100:4:::6834688:4:::6816341:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6866291:4:::6826738:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5816422:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6836599:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6292077:4:::6657747:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pyrex Glass Round Casserole::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::15.06.2011::::    This category does not specify which size of round Pyrex dish so I am generalising.I have used, own and have had many Pyrex Glass Round Casseroles in varying sizes over the past 40 years. Pyrex glass casseroles are made in several different sizes. 0.75L, 1.25L 2.0L, 2.5L 3.0L, 3.75L and probably moreThe top circumference of the casserole is a tiny bit bigger than the base. The depth of these casseroles is good. Each casserole has 2 little handles formed out of the same glass. These provide somewhere to hold and grip your casserole when taking it out of the oven Pyrex casseroles have a lid. The lids have little glass  lips/handles to match the casserole dish. There are also round casseroles with a single glass knob as a handle in the centre of the lid. The lids fit well and are good for saving splatters in the oven.Not only do I use these circular Pyrex lids  with  little glass lips/handles to match the casserole  dish to cover food over the dish  but I have often used then as a little pie/tart plate or to place small items on to reheat in the microwave.The small size casserole is .75 L (I have 2) capacity wise they are just ok for 2 people. I sometimes make a fruit crumble in them, sometimes just use them to reheat food. I also have a 2.5L and 3L Pyrex casserole. These are ideal for cooking large casseroles in for if the family are visiting or for us to eat some and freeze some for another day. Pyrex dishes are really versatile; sometimes I will use one to mix a cake mix in. I cook both meat or vegetable casseroles in them, use them to cook puddings or cakes in. They are ideal for using in the microwave to cook vegetables In 1879 a glass was developed  by corning inc to  and was used in the first ever light bulb, in 1912 a heat resistant glass was made for lanterns This glass was very heat resistant and does not shatter easily. In 1915 the first Pyrex plate was made.  I think there will be very few households now without at least one Pyrex product. Pyrex is suitable for  the oven, microwave, fridge freezer, dishwasher, or hand washing.  Heat resistant to 300 degrees C. The surface does not scratch. The glass is clear so great for seeing what is happening inside as it cooks.Theses dishes have a 10 year gaurente.Pyrex casserole dishes are really versatile I would certainly recommend..      ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6845153:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6887858:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6844462:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5816422:4:::6657747:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6878095:4:::5203100:4:::6889199:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6757231:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Suttons Confetti Corriander::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::13.06.2011::::    Suttons Confetti Coriander, Coriander is spelt with one r.I like growing my own herbs both in the garden and on my kitchen window sill. Not too long ago I bought some Suttons seeds, one variety I bought was the confetti coriander. This cost me    1.69 for a packet containing 150 seedsThe plants that grow from these tiny seeds are hardy annuals. I planted my seeds in a small flowerpot containing potting compost. The seeds did not need to be very deep only6-13mm.I kept them watered and germination took 12 days. The packet says 7-14days. The germination ate was good most of the seeds germinated.I looked after the seedlings in a sunny windowed and kept watering them. They have not needed a lot of looking after. As they were on my kitchen window sill above the sink it was easy to water them when they needed it. I started picking the coriander leaves 30 days after sowing. They are still very small plants so have only used them in a salad. The plants will continue growing to give me more. *LooksThe leaves are very attractive fern like, dainty, lacy and feathery, daintier than a normal coriander leaf. I expect they are called confetti because of their daintiness.*SmellThe leaves especially when crushed smell quite strong. Not everyone likes the smell and taste of coriander*Taste.Leaves So how do they taste? Coriander leaves taste aromatic and fresh fresh, I think the confetti coriander has a bit more of a zing to it than the normal coriander, and a little sweetness.*Flower I shall grow some on to flower. The flowering time will depend on how watered I keep them. They should flower in about 1-2 months less if not watered well as the plant goes into panic mode to flower and seed before it dries out.*Seed I have yet to taste the seed but coriander seeds taste a bit nutty, spicy and have a slight citrus flavour.UseleavesI use coriander leaves to give zing to salads and add to plain yoghurt to have with curry. I will also add to curry.seedsI add coriander seeds to curries.

One item was the Casio CA-26 cradle. I needed this when I have a Casio EX-z750. This camera I no longer use. I dropped it down a mountain never to be seen again.The cradle I no longer use as I think it only fits the camera that I lost.  The camera can still be bought for just over    200. I looked on line for the price of the docking cradle but no success. I seem to remember it came as part of the camera package.The cradle measures 11cmx6cmx 2cm.The cradle is a USB cradle and AC adaptor.  When the camera is positioned on the docking cradle you can view your pictures, download them into your computer and recharge the battery this cradle will easily be attached to the computer with a cable. There is another cable with a 3 pin plug which can be added to this and will fit into an electric socket so you can recharge the battery while it is still in position in the camera.   When the camera is fixed onto the cradle and the electricity switched on the little light on the cradle will turn red this will turn green when the battery in the camera is fully charged. This takes a couple of hours.When fitted into a port in a computer the photos are down loaded.I had no real problems with this docking cradle, it was simple to use. It was a bit big to take on holiday just in case I needed it though I just looked on line and find http://www.amazon.com have some for 79.99.When I sort my camera equipment out a bit more I think I will sell this Casio ca-26 USB cradle on eBay     ::::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::3957:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6157866:3:::6157866:3:::5806017:3:::5806017:3:::6737129:3:::6737129:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5790028:3:::5314452:3:::5314452:3:::6855394:3:::6855394:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5719918:3:::6880889:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5439461:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6890749:4:::6890749:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6826738:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6816341:4:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::6887858:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5203100:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Zoo Mum - Ted Smart::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::12.06.2011::::    Zoomum .This is a hard back book for very young children .It measures 23cmx23cm. The 16 pages are very thin card and they are concertina bound. This book is quite hard wearing I bought it second hand for my granddaughter now still in good condition 4 years later I am passing it on to my special needs school.My edition was published by the book people, copyright 2004; I can no price information on it.This is a touch and feel adventure book it will engage your child   s senses of sight when they see the pictures, their senses of sound when they hear you telling the story and their senses of touch when they feel the different textures.The Story is about a penguin who lost his mum and goes off to find her.On the first double page spread we see penguin on his own, on the ice in what looks like a zoo or circus setting. The first words set the scene and we see penguin walking. Now put your child   s hands over the picture of the penguin and they will feel a soft flock, rub your hands over the rest of the picture, the edges of the ice path that penguin is walking is slightly raised... There are a few balloons pictured in the sky, these are very slightly raised so they can be felt.Turn the page and we see the lion the first of the animals the Penguin says    You   re not my mum and then points out a feature which is not the same as his mothers. In the lions case    your teeth are too scary   . The lion is a magnificent beast the picture of his head which takes up one full page is very realistic. We feel the flock penguin and the lion. I can feel the ridges of the lion   s mane I can feel a line where the lion   s eyes are closed, I can feel his smooth scary teeth. We read the book meeting the turtle, the giraffe, the peacock the whale, then at last we met penguins mum who feels the same as penguin except bigger. The final words we read are    you   re my mum and I love you.    All the illustrations are good large realistic and not fussy.There are not many words on each double page spread. At first they will be read by the adult. The words are repetitive and your child will soon pick up the words and repeat them with you .your child will tell you why the animal featured is not mum. . Looking at books and reading to your child is the first stage of learning to read, to enjoy books and realise the written words mean something.The texture as in this book are very soft   and some not always easy to detect. Some are flock and some are embossed, some a raised varnished area. This is a book for touching and feeling gently and softly.Tactile books are great for stimulating and engaging children. Baby   s first encounters are very tactile, they touch and feel things to help understand them, and everything goes straight to baby   s mouth which is very sensitive. Hopefully your child will not mouth and chew this book too much.Sensory books are good for young children they help the child keep interest in the story; they enhance the story and help add meaning to the words. Tactile books are good to use with partially sighted children to enable them to feel the shape or texture of things they might otherwise not be able to.  The book Zoo mum is a lovely book there are many, many books out there about animals and zoo   s I would certainly recommend this one for a first book or for a child with sensory deprivation.      ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5719918:4:::6887246:4:::6887246:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6843584:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6145850:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6826738:4:::5261772:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::5203100:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6887858:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5439461:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6850502:5:::6850502:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Strong Brown Bread Flour::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.06.2011::::    I have an opened bag of Tesco   s strong brown flour in my store cupboard. I bought it for    1.24 recently the Sainsbury   s equivalent is the same price.This flour comes in a two tones brown coloured bag containing 1.5 kg. The bag is easy to open and you can either store the flour in the bag or put it in a flour bin.This strong brown flour is made from wheat flour and contains gluten. Strong flour means that it has more gluten than ordinary flour this helps a loaf rise and be lighter.  Usually wheat grown in a hot dry area and grows faster has more gluten in it.There are 330kcal per 100g in this brown strong flour.This flour is a light brown colour and very powdery, not a good idea to drop it as flour gets everywhere. This flour absorbs water well.This brown flour is a strong brown flour so can be used for bread making, I have and it makes a reasonable loaf. I will often use     brown and 1/2white flour to make bread.I have also used this flour when making crumble mixes for apple or rhubarb crumble.  I use it if I make pizza bases too. Sometimes I add it to white flour to make pasty.Although I frequently use half brown and half white flour it is not because the flour tastes very    brown   . This flour is just a brown flour to get a better wholemeal flavour try a wholemeal flour.I find this not only suitable for bread making but a good all round flour.     ::::6691451:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6890814:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::5592334:3:::5592334:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6855394:3:::6855394:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6887246:4:::6887246:4:::6657747:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6826738:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6816341:4:::5203100:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

We have got a copy of this at school anyway but another one is good.Winnie the Pooh and ten busy bees was first published in 2002.The copy that I have was first published by the book people in 2004.This book is based on Winnie the Pooh  by Author AA Milne illustrated by E.H. Shepard I would be very surprised if anyone here did not know of the fun honey loving bear and his friends.Winnie the Pooh and the ten busy Bees    is a hardback book 23cmx18.5 cm with 22 pages. The inside pages are a hard card too.  The Pages are wipe clean. This is a very hard wearing book very robust, my copy 6 or 7 years old still in nearly new condition.This book is suitable for a 2 year old +. It is a counting from 10 down book.The front cover, a cloud blue  has a picture of Winnie the Pooh  hanging on to a string which is attached to a blue balloon, There are 10 1.1/2 cm round holes cut into the board cover to the book Each one has a plastic die-cut plastic bee moulding in it. As you go through the book you will discover  that each page has one bee stuck on it and  reducing number of holes which display the bees on the other pages peeping through them till the last page where there are    No busy bees with Winnie- the- Pooh, But Winnie knows just what to do. Come along Piglet. Come along Roo. It   s time for tea    and some honey too   Each number has a double page spread. The first side with the 4 line rhyme starting with the number of busy bees for that page.  This has the correct number of very small busy bees drawn on it and a pencil drawing of one of Pooh s friends, Roo, wol Piglet tiger, Christopher Robin Eeyeore and Rabbit. These animals feature in the rhymes. For example    Christopher Robin is jumping too   . There is a lot of word repetition too which aids learning.My Grandchildren both enjoyed this book being read to them and helping them learn to count. My special needs children at work also enjoy this book.What young children like to do is stick their fingers through the holes and feel the lumpy bumpy bees. These bees are a great aid to learning with this book. The child feeling and counting the bees initially with you but hopefully eventually on their own (some of my students might never achieve this) I will not just read the words but touch and get the children to touch and count the plastic bees. Sometimes the children will join in with the counting sometimes they need to be encouraged to repeat the number as I say it.The illustrations in this book are great mostly they just feature Winnie the Pooh and one of his friends in a grassy field they are not too fussy and busy. The children who have read this book with me like these pictures they will name the characters and I will ask the children what is happening, what the animal is doing, Eeyore is floating on his back in the stream.So while reading this book we are learning our numbers and some language skills too.AMAZON Price for this book new is    8.75 or used from 1p  The price on the back of my book is    9.99.I think that for some reason this book is no longer published , however it is available at many websites just do a search.I notice on line  that a Winnie The Pooh Busy Bee 123 Wallpaper Border is available for decorating that Winnie the Pooh bedroom. Would I recommend this book? Yes     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6691451:4:::6887246:4:::6887246:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6826738:4:::6838035:4:::6838035:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6874894:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6805406:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6701923:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6891122:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6887858:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6658557:4:::6658557:4:::6190414:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Canon Battery Charger LC E6::::Cameras::::50::::very helpful::::07.06.2011::::    Battery charger LC-E6, for the Canon 5D Mark 11 and 7D camerasCanon (and other camera manufacturers), have an annoying habit of building equipment with a unique fitting so that if you need accessories you can   t employ parts made by rival manufacturers. This includes the very expensive lenses (for DSLRs), the flash units, the wireless remotes and even the rechargeable batteries. Worse still, quite often these new bits of kit are incompatible with some of the parts previously sold by that same manufacturer. Generally speaking, canon lenses and flash units sold in the last 15 years fit most Canon cameras, though there might be a slight loss of performance with older parts on the newer equipment. However, the rechargeable batteries are quite frequently suitable for a limited number of cameras; and you have little choice but to fit the manufacturers own brand as the connectors and housing for the battery are formed to prevent other very similar looking batteries being used. No DSLRs and very few compact cameras will accept    standard    batteries, so if you upgrade your camera and want a spare battery you are forced to buy a specific model (though you may already have apparently similar batteries, previously purchased but now incompatible, in other cameras). Sometimes these changes in battery design provide real improvements in performance and sometimes they seem simply intended to extract extra cash from hapless punters who are upgrading their kit. And, as each rechargeable battery has a specific shape and connector arrangement, they all need purpose built chargers. This is the case with the LC-E6. It only recharges LP-E6 batteries for 2 Canon cameras (EOS 5D Mark 11 and 7D) and it comes in two versions, the LC-E6 (American model) and LC-E6e (European model with detachable mains cable). Speaking of shape and connector fit, the LP-E6 battery doesn   t fit the recharging unit in the way you intuitively expect. It doesn   t slide in from one end but has to be positioned very close to its connectors and then pushed down into the recharge unit before being slid the last 2 or 3 millimetres into place. This is fiddly and can be frustrating on first use. While it could be argued that the design of the housing and connectors might well have been made compatible with the batteries from earlier Canon cameras (and easier to fit to the charger), this LP-E6 battery is capable of a longer life and permits very rapid firing of the camera. Previous batteries might provide a less satisfactory experience. I have the LC-E6 version and despite being designed for the American market I prefer it to the European version for its ease of packing. As photo 1 shows 2 silver prongs extend from the back of the recharger unit and these are spaced to connect straight into an American domestic power socket. These prongs are hinged and swivel to lie flat inside the body of the charger making it smooth sided for easy transport (photo 2). With a small and inexpensive adaptor attached (as in photo 3) it can be used in England, Europe etc. When travelling abroad I always have to carry adaptors anyway (for other electrical devices) so this is not    extra    weight to carry. The European version (LC-E6e) is also a smooth rectangle but requires a connecting lead to a plug and an adaptor if travelling abroad unless you also get the lead with the European 2 pin plug at one end. This is a minor difference, but one that could add a few extra grams to your packing. Of course if you own more than one camera and have to take separate chargers for each the extra weight is even worse.The LC-E6 unit charges faultlessly and the state of the batteries charge is shown by a winking LED on the charger unit. From a slow (nearly flat) single flash, through a double flash (50  charged) to a faster rate of triple flashes (75  charged), until a continuously lit LED, shows full charge. Charging is reasonably fast with a flat battery recharging in approx 100 minutes, however, if you need to use it sooner that is no problem. The LP-E6 battery is capable of being recharged and used from any state of charge, without impairment to its future recharging abilities. In the parlance of those who talk about rechargeable batteries it has no    memory   . This    charge memory    prevents lesser batteries being recharged beyond the point at which they were previously charged, until eventually they become useless. As soon as you think that there is enough charge in the battery for any particular task you can remove it and use it without damaging either the battery or recharge unit.Even so, according to the manufacturer, the LP-E6 battery does eventually lose some of its power to hold a full charge (not that I have experienced this drop off in performance myself). So, another feature designed into the new LP-E6 battery is its ability to tell the camera how it is getting along with recharging. As it loses ability to gain a full recharge and deliver max performance it informs the camera, in terms of percentage capability. This is a different reading from that given from the LC-E6 charger which informs as to the   charge applied up to the battery   s maximum potential to hold charge. So a battery that has only got the ability to hold 75  of its original full charge will show a continuously lit LED on the LC-E6 recharging unit once that point (75 ) is reached.RRP is     80 .68 http://www.microglobe.co.uk are selling it for    38.80 Several other online shops are selling it for a similar price.     ::::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::3957:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6866291:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6857875:4:::6857875:4:::5719918:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6691451:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6876907:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5203100:4:::5790028:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6829585:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6887858:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6880805:5:::5511950:5:::5511950:5:::6850502:5:::6850502:5:::6576767:5:::6576767:5:::6654280:5:::6654280:5:::5769137:5:::5769137:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This battery charger will charge Panasonic Battery DMW-BCG10E, DMWBCG10E, BCG10E, DMW BCG10E.I have an almost identical battery charger which I had for a different camera. I occasionally try to inset my DMW-BCG10E battery and discover the hole is not the same size. It is so annoying that a newer camera by the same maker has different batteries and so needs new charger.This charger is one that fits to the mains. It has a 3 pin plug and a 150cm long cable. You can also buy it with either a European or a USA 2 pin plug as well. The plug and lead is removable from the recharge unit. The charger unit itself is black and rectangular it measures 7.1/2 cm by 5cm it is 2cm fat. It has a rectangular space just the right size to lay the battery into.  It is easy to position the battery, impossible to put the battery in the wrong way; I know I just tried every which way.When the battery is placed into the charger a red light shows, when the charging complete the light changes to greenI find my battery takes a couple of hours to recharge fully.Amazom price    24.95 AT http://www.uk-batteries-chargers.com/digital-camera-battery-chargers/products.php/Panasonic/DE-A66/  ITS 12.55     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5790028:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6690494:3:::6690494:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::6220775:3:::6220775:3:::6421517:3:::6421517:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::6654280:3:::6654280:3:::5439461:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6887858:4:::5203100:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6817953:4:::6817953:4:::5816422:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

But there is no need to do this. It will depend on what I am doing if I leave the battery charging for just a couple of hours or longer to fully charge. I find there is no noticeable loss of power if I leave the camera unused for any time.My camera has an indicator as to how well charged the battery is.Rechargeable batteries do eventually die but I have used   mine and recharged many times for a couple of years and it is still going.:Storage There is a warning not to store this battery at a very high temperature it will not work very well at very low temperatures either.

Self raising flour is one I uses for cakes and scones, some biscuits too anything which needs self raising flour.This is white flour, wheat flour which contains gluten. So it   s not suitable for some people with allergies. To make this self raising flour it also contains Calcium phosphate and Sodium Bicarbonate to raise those bakes.There are330kcal per 100g   I buy my  self raising flour in the shop it is stacked along with other baking items.  It costs 45p for the 500g bag. or 98p for 1.5kg. You could always shop on line at http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/tesco-price-comparison/Flour/Tesco_Self_Raising_Flour_This flour needs to be stored in a dry place or it will absorb moisture and get damp..Opening this sealed paper bag is easy, either gently tear the top or cut it.I its best to spoon the four out pouring it you might make a mess with flour spilling and flying everywhere.Weigh out the flour you need. If you wish sieve it, I do not really find this necessary.I find mixing flour in easy using a spoon, you could of course use a food mixer.I find little difference in this raw flour and the mixing of it compared to the Tesco value flour or more expensive flours.Now to the end product   ..  My cakes and biscuits rise fine using this flour .I make pretty good cakes even if I say so myself.There are so many recipes using self raising flour sweet or savoury I shall not be leaving one here , but do look at http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/self-raising_flour if you want some ideas. This flour could be used for sensory play with your child feeling it dry then adding water. Put some in a tray and practice drawing and writing skills.

I grow my own Basil; Basil sits in a pot on my windowsill. I recently got bored with green Basil thought I needed some colour in my life so bought a pack of Suttons Red Basil for    1.69. I bought mine on a visit to the local garden centre but Red Basil is available in many supermarkets or hardware gardening shops. On line look at http://www.thegardenshoponline.co.uk/suttons-herb-seeds-basil-red where it is available for   1.13 There are about 300 seeds in the standard Suttons foil lined seed envelope. That   s more than enough for my needs. The seeds are black small oval shapes.I nearly fill my small pots with compost then sprinkle a few, about 10 seeds onto the compost then I cover them with about 6mm of fine compost. When I have sown all the seeds I need I turn the top of the packet over several times to keep moisture out..As I am growing them indoors I can do this any time of the year. If I were growing outside in the garden I need to sow between March and June.I read on the packet that Basil likes very well drained soil mine is chalk so I might just give these a try in my gardenAfter sowing seeds I kept them watered and it took about 17 days for them to germinate, I had nearly given up.  The number of seeds which germinated was good. It takes another week or two before the red leaves are big enough to pick.  The leaves are a dark purple red. If I pinch the top leaves it will give me a bushy plant. If I leave until they are just beginning to flower then I can pick and hang them up to dry to save for winter use.Basil is an annual so I will need to reseed for the next plant, for continuous use in the summer I really need to  plant fresh seed every 3 or 4weeks. I very rarely let my basil flower but it does produce a small light pink flower.Basil is a very aromatic plant the leaves smell wonderful remind me of Mediterranean holidays      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6878095:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6657747:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5719918:4:::6691451:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6841809:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6805406:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6874193:4:::6874193:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6390014:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6880410:4:::6880410:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6866291:4:::5203100:4:::6887858:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I use this Pyrex roaster for cooking many items, roast joints chicken, or chops or sausages. Pyrex will withstand heat up to 300c I never cook anything that hot, it would burn.Pyrex glass is good it   s fairly easy to clean either by hand with hot water detergent and elbow grease or in the dishwasher.I find this glass does not stain It is scratch resistant mine after several years use has not scratched.

I have owned this card several years now. This card fits in my Panasonic Lumix camera.The card is very thin and measures2x3cm. It is blue with a black label giving information stuck to it. Looking at the back of it I see the brass gold interior where the plastic coating has been cut to expose the contacts. At one corner there is a small angle cut. There is only one way the card will fit into the camera.The card slips easily into the slot for it on my camera.Now point and click and it does the job in he camera. Wire my camera to my computer and the pictures will be down loaded, easy I have had no problem taking storing and downloading pictures using this card. I think I read somewhere it would hold about 333 images.I am not sure  about super speed seems fast enough to me. This memory card made by Jessops has no moving parts so unlikely to get damaged. When I am not using it the card gets stored in a small hard plastic wallet in my camera bag. The card being small I worry about it getting lost.I have had no trouble with this cards performance and durability.I found on line it costs    6.97 at jessops      ::::5806017:3:::5806017:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::6889612:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::6654280:3:::6654280:3:::5808829:3:::6829585:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6800944:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Cdiscount Natural Origins Herb Cutting Board & Chopper::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::02.06.2011::::     I have owned a chopping board and cutter identical to the one pictured here for a couple of years now so I am presuming it is the same product. I can not remember where I got mine from, but I notice Amazon is selling it for 12.99 free deliveries. This chopping board is made of rubber wood.The chopping board is circular it is 24cm in diameter. Its a good thickness 2.1/2 cm stands up well  on shelf with my trays. There is an outer flat lip of3cm before the very shallow cutting bowl.Around the lip of the chopping board the words chives, parsley, thyme and rosemary are written there are a few images of the herbs between the words. I find this quite attractive to look at. It will fit in my kitchen draw but does not look out of place if left out in my country styled kitchenTo go with this board I have a curved two handled chopping knife. The blade is steel the handles rubber wood.I like using this knife and chopping board. The curved knife makes it easier than using my sharp flat knife and a flat wooden chopping board.I use my chopping board and cutter if I am chopping herbs or some vegetables.I place the herbs in the centre of the board then hold the cutter by both handles. I then rock the cutter across the herbs cutting and chopping them into pieces the size I require. I can in fact cut herbs very fine if required. I have also cut cucumber, onions and carrots with the chopper. This chopping action is easy, easier than chopping with a knife. It may be easier to chop herbs in a mechanised chopper but I find the rocking cutting action that I have to use with this board and blade easy. I find cleaning the blade easy in warm soapy water and the board washes easily too. I have not noticed lingering herby smells on my chopping board that might taint the next item that I chop.I love the smell of freshly chopped herbs in my kitchen when I use this board and blade. I find the blade sharp enough for the items that I need to chop. I have as I said owned this for 2 or 3 years and I have not needed to sharpen the blade. The chopping board itself is still in good condition there are a few marks from the blade in the wood where I have been over zealous with my chopping action.I fully expect this Rubber Wood Herb Chopping Board to last me many, many more years.I notice on Amazon this sells for    12.95 with free delivery and    7.95 plus    5.95 delivery. I have not noticed one in an off line shop recently but imagine you would be able to buy one the same or similar somewhere.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6691451:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6657747:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6845153:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5295842:4:::5295842:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6750576:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6887858:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This 3 volt memory card is 2cm by 3cm it is very thin It is a solid hard blue plastic type of material. There is a little label that says Kingstone SD2GB on it.  On one side at the top I can see brassy gold coloured insets. These cards have to be inserted into my camera in the correct way. That   s not too difficult as one of the top corners is cut slightly and it will only fit into my camera in the correct way. I do not use a card reader as I just pug my camera into my computer and it downloads the photo   s from my card.There are no moving parts to this card so they will not break or wear out.  It has a lifetime warranty. I have used this card for a couple of years now taking many photos. They are made of non-volatile memory components. I find it easy to use .I just insert it into my camera and click and shoot. To download I then plug my camera into my computer and push the button on my computer as my computer asks and my pictures are down loaded. When I have saved my pictures My computer asks me if I want to delete the photos on my card I say yes and the card is emptied ready to begin recording my photo   s againI can delete them straight from my camera too.I am not exactly sure how many images this card will store but manufacturers say it will store up to 953. Still or 33 video images. I have a spare memory card in my camera case in case I need it but rarely do. You will find all the info you need to know at http://www.kingston.com/flash/securedigital.aspI bought my memory card in a high street photographic shop but you can easily buy it on line probably cheaper. At Amazon I notice it is on sale for as little as 70p plus delivery or 4.25 upwards with free delivery.I have found using my card easy positioning and removing it from   the camera good images easy to download, and it   s durable.  In my childhood when we were still using huge pin whole cameras that taking a photograph would become so easy with such tiny components.

Cakeboards ltd is a firm whose head office is in Burnley. This company started in the 1940   s I have in my kitchen cupboard some dainty little petit four cases I think I bought them for Christmas cooking. The designs on my cake cases are not the ones featured on top of this category but I expect this is simply that cake boards change their designs. I have had Christmas designs on petit four cases before but not sure if they were a cake board product. However back the cake board petit four cases that I have. The pack of 100 paper cases (it says approx 100 on the back) contains 2 patterns on the cake cases there are 50 with each pattern.These cake cases are 2.1/2cm in diameter at the base .The height 2cm. The sides of the cake cases are pleated.I have made many varieties of cakes and used these cases over the years I have made plain cakes chocolate caked cherry cakes difficult to make them into butterfly cakes because of the size. I have decorated cakes in these cases using butter cream or glace icing. If you wanted too you could use them to individual strawberries in or grapes, maybe a piece of cheese. Look pretty on a party table.Theses cake cases are so sweet and little they would be ideal for dolly   s tea party.These are ideal for dieters as a cake made in one of these is so small, however one of the cakes made in these is not enough for a hungry person.It is fairly easy to peel one of these cases of the cooked cake; you would not really want to eat the case. Feeling the case just now I think it   s made of some sort of waxed paper.A pack of 100 of these cake cases costs 70p in Tesco   sSorry no cakes baked Broken arm prohibits     ::::6860710:3:::6860710:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::5306962:3:::5306962:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5066197:3:::5066197:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6691451:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6657747:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6824315:4:::6824315:4:::6190414:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6889612:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6887858:4:::5439461:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6866291:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Lavender Furniture Polish::::House & Garden::::40::::helpful::::29.05.2011::::    I like polished wood. I love the smell of freshly polished wood. To polish my wood at home I have Tesco lavender spray polish. I am not loyal to this polish it seemed a good price 59p for 300ml.  Other spray polishes like Pledge or Mr Sheen retail at    1 or over Tesco value which I quite like is 31p. Sainsbury   s equivalent is 61p.I am not sure why I have lavender polish as I dislike lavender smells. however this polish does not smell too strongly. This polish comes in a tall cylindrical can with a press spay button central top no lid on it. The can is a silvery lilac lavender colour.First I shake the can then when the top is depressed it squirts out a spray of polish, the quantity just right for me to polish onto my table with a duster. I squirted the polish on my table and polished with my duster it did a satisfactory job, quite good. I did not have to use excess polish. My table looked better had only a slight lavender smell to it which will dissipate in time. This polish will help keep my wooden furniture in good condition and keep it looking good. Tesco sell a polish for the same price that is a natural smell I prefer that smell.This polish has beeswax in it. The instructions and warnings on the side of the can are v small.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Foil Round Trays::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::30.05.2011::::     I had better hurry up to tell you about the offer on these Tesco foil trays as it finishes soon.These cost    1.50 normally for a pack of 3 they are costing    1. 20 until 1 June so if you think you will need them this summer then stock up now.I had a pack of these for our Christmas party, but no longer have one to show you.Tesco describe them as trays I think foil plates a more accurate description. However theses trays/ plates come wrapped in clear plastic with a stuck on label giving you info.Theses are circular plates 30cm in diameter. They are made of a fairly thick silver foil.  The foil plate is shiny but slightly speckled in appearance. There is a narrow lip around the raised rim. The rest of the platter is flat.I bought these for a party and served little cakes from one sausage roll and quiche from another. These can be used to serve many things from. Good for serving a flan or quiche from.Although I have not and I do not have the instructions here I am sure you could pop them in the oven *not microwave to heat the contents on.The foods that I served on mine were non messy so I washed the foil plates /trays afterwards with hot water and washing up liquid. I have reused these trays a couple of times at home then took them to school with something   s on.I do not think these would last many washes a few maybe.I found them convenient as I was not sure that I had enough large plates for serving. Also saves the possibility of breakages at a party.I usually reuse where I can but at 40p each and at a large party it would not be the end of the world if they got thrown away. However do rinse and put in the foil recycling.Note, I have uses a similar round foil tray as the moon in a wall display in the class room. Yes I was satisfied with these they suited my use.     ::::3957:3:::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5805376:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6838035:4:::6838035:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6841809:4:::6654507:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6880805:4:::6876907:4:::6419938:4:::6419938:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6845486:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6657747:4:::5820231:4:::5820231:4:::5347743:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The box is about 10cmx 8cmx1cm.Once you have the clear outer wrapper of plastic off the box it   s easy to open by the flip up lid which runs along the top. Cadbury chocolates are one of the better tasting chocolates  I take one chocolate out of the box , each individual chocolate is a mini bar only measuring about 3cmx2cmx 0.5cm. This bar is not the individual wrapped two chunks of chocolate you sometimes get but a thin rectangular bar with the Cadbury swirl and the word Cadbury scribed in the centre. These chocolates are individually wrapped the outer a blue paper then the inner foil.These mini chocolate bars taste just like the large ones.  If you sniff one it smells of sweet chocolate. Cadbury chocolates are one of the better tasting chocolates and they are fair trade.. One of these miniature chocolate is a good size for the mouth, although one will probably not be enough these chocolates are ideal for sharing with a friend or maybe two. There are 25 calories per sweetThese little chocolates make a good addition to a toy sweet shopThese mini chocolate bars are good as a treat present. It is still possible to get that Cadbury mini chocolate bar money box dispenser and they do need refilling with these chocolates.I have not seen any of these boxes of chocolates since Christmas in high street shops but on line you can buy them uasally in quantity. http://corporate.cadburygiftsdirect.co.uk/products/323-dairy-milk-miniatures.aspx sells 18 boxes for    22.50 excluding VAT    27.00 including VAThttp://www.amazon.co.uk is selling 2 packs for    3.99.

They are all 350mm wide the smallest roll 25m long costing    1.28 that   s 51.2p per 10m, the next size 50m long only costs    2.04 that   s 40.8p per 10m. The largest roll 100m long costs   3.06 that   s 30.6p per 10 m.*Just in case you did not know.Cling film is a very thin plastic film which will cling to it and other things.*These rolls of cling film come in a card box which you open long ways to reveal a cutting edge.*I have a fruit salad in a bowl which I just prepared I have no lid or plate that will cover the top, so I unravel the edge of the cling film. This is quite difficult as the cling film is very thin. I make the film cling to one edge of the top of my bowl, and then carefully pull it tight over the whole of the top making it cling to the other side. I then cut the cling film from the roll with scissors I have tried tearing but cling film tears unevenly making a mess and not tearing where I want it too The top of my bowl with the fruit salad successfully covered I put it in the fridge. The cling film keeping bits from falling in it and keeping it fresher.+ Tesco   s cling film is good for covering foodstuffs .Ideal for wrapping sandwiches in if you have no sandwich bags, good for wrapping that slice of cake in so that it does not get dry. Tesco Clingfilm is good for wrapping and covering left overs.I have used Tesco cling film for art and craft projects with children too. Children first colour and decorate old tubes toilet roll or kitchen foil ones empty Pringles tubes ideal. Then cover the end with cling film to make the lens for a telescope or double the tubes to make binoculars. (ok so the vision through these tubes is not good, so what   s imagination for) I have also used it for covering sea scenes pictures that the children make with fishes this cling film gives a watery look alike film over their picture. Cling film is also great for covering up the paint pots with loads of unused liquid paints in them to stop the paint drying out.I find this Tesco cling film good as good as others that I have used. It   s handy to have in my kitchen drawI have never used it in my microwave but Tesco says it is Fridge, freezer and microwave safe I just looked it up and apparently cling film first used to wrap food in 1956. In some form it was discovered in 1933 and used to coat aircraft to protect them.

       " '5247778::::Red hot poker::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::28.05.2011::::    Red hot poker Have 3 red hot Pokers in my garden. This plant is a perennial and the ones in my garden several years old.The Red hot poker kniphofia uvaria is sometimes known as the torch lily. It is a native of South Africa and at some time introduced to the UK. It thrives very well here.There are several varieties of this flower which grow to heights between 3 and 5 foot. They range in colours of orange through to red. I prefer the darker red ones. They will bloom from late May through the summer till September depending on the varietyThese plants like 3 a sunny position certainly the one in the sunnier position in my garden does best. They like a rich well drained soil my soil is very chalky not very rich.The long thin leaves quite fleshy grow from the base. The flower grows on a tall spike. The flower spike is made up of many little tube shaped florets. Often the lower florets are yellow or orange and change colour to red as they progress up the spike.These flowers look great at the back of an herbaceous border bold and bright, like a rocket taking off for the sky..The Bees and other small insects quite like this plant if they can get their proboscis /tongues down the tubular florets apparently sparrows do this too. I n South Africa I read that humming birds will visit this flower to drink nectar. The Red hot poker grows on a tuber it is fairly easy to divide and propagate this way. I think my original tuber came from a plant that my dad divided at his home.I am pleased that several of my plants actually originate from my childhood home when I notice them in the garden I get a warm feeling remembering my parents and their garden.Seeds or plants can be bought at garden centres on or off line see Thompson-morgan.com/seeds/Red 20Hot 20Poker where a pack of seeds cost    1.49 a plant    7.99 When the flowers fade remove them, this will encourage new spikes. When tidying up the garden in the autumn I shall remove some of the leaves as they go a bit manky.     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6701923:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6876907:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6691451:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6190414:4:::6816341:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

A roll of this paper is handy to have around.This roll from Tesco in its mustard yellow box measures 375mm x 20m which is quite long lasts me a long time. This roll of paper costs only    1.46.This paper is quite heavy and stiff it is a waxed paper that does not absorb fat.I cut the required size of my roll line my cake tin with this greaseproof paper when I cook my Christmas cake. First cutting the base then some strips for the sides I then coat the greaseproof paper in cooking oil brushing it over with my pastry brush. I also use some of this greaseproof paper brushed with oil to leave my peppermint creams on to dry they are easy to remove after. I use grease proof  paper to line baking trays sometimes. I find as long as i grease it well its east to remove the foodstuffs I have made musical instruments with this grease proof paper, a simple comb wrapped with a single piece of grease proof paper then blown by your mouth as if playing harmonica will make a tune.OR cut a piece and place over empty biscuit tin the tie on and use it as a drum. Now a kazoo needs an empty toilet roll and you tie a piece of greaseproof paper over one end then blow from the open end it makes a buzzing sound.Crayoning with wax crayons over Tesco   s greased paper is fun for children too, I have just been reminded by Kate hurst that it makes good tracing paper too.

       " '5247778::::Lucky Ducks::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.05.2011::::    My grandchildren have had this Hasbro game for several years now. And now too old for it my daughter gave it to me for my school.Looking today I can not see many shops selling it. http://uk.toyssale.com/hasbro+toys+uk+lucky+ducks  is selling it for    9.99.I have played with this game and my grandchildren many times. It is a colour and shape sorting game suitable for children aged 3 years old and over.This game comes in a card box with pictures of ducks on it. I received it in this box which was still in good condition after several years. (Yes the game has been played with)Basically this is a blue plastic pond surrounded by a green plastic edge with a small green island in the middle. The island has a big red button to push. The shape is roughly circular. On each quarter section of the green grass coloured surround there is a small coloured shape. There is a red circle, blue star, orange triangle, Purple Square.This game needs 2 LR14 1.5v/3v batteries, fit under a green panel on the base you will need a small Phillips screw driver to get into it and change batteries.There This game is suitable for up to 4 players.To set the game up all you have to do is put the identical looking yellow plastic ducks on the pond. On the bottom of these ducks is a coloured symbol which matches one of the 4 on the pond surround.Each player decides which   matching ducks they are going to collect. The red middle button pushed then the fun begins.This is where the pond moves round and the quacking starts. The pond quacks it will quack whether there are ducks on it or not. We transported this from my daughter   s house to ours and when ever the car went over a bump it started quacking.This is where each child picks up a duck and sees if it matches their shape if it does them keeps it until they have all three, the first child with their three matching ducks wins.It is best that you introduce turn taking with this game and only one pair of hands is taking a duck. If it does not match their symbol then it is returned to the pond and the next person chooses their duck. The choosing of the correct duck is complete luck as there are no differences visible till one is chosen then turned over. If you see one of the other players picking up then returning your duck then try and watch it as they swim round the pond. This game can be played with the pond rotating all the time or switched of when it is someone   s turn to choose a duck.Yes my grandchildren enjoyed this game one the older by 3 years was prepared to play with the younger for a while.Benefits of this toy are learning to share and turn take. observation matching the shapes/colours. Learning 4 shapes and colours, as a shape and colour teaching game it is limited. I know of better colour and shape toys.My daughter only allowed limited play time for this toy as the quacking really is irritating.When I use this toy at work with my special needs pupils the sound is a good motivator, some of my children like really noisy toys. Picking the ducks up will give my pupils some extra motor control and hand eye coordination practice, I am sure they will soon learn that pressing the red centre button makes that quacking noise (perhaps I can wear ear plugs for the times we play this game)     ::::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6889991:4:::6889991:4:::6878095:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5223273:4:::5223273:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6864207:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5808829:4:::5790340:4:::5790340:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5285637:4:::6887858:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Xanthos remains of a Lycian City, Xanthos::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::25.05.2011::::    One of the places that I visited while in Turkey this Easter was Xanthos,  Xanthos was the capital city of the Lycian community in south west turkey before the Romans cameWe were staying at Kas on the Mediterranean Coast of Turkey. There are many Lycian places to visit in this area. Xanthos is situated just of the D400 near Kinik this is about half way 20 km between Fethiye and Kalkan not too far from Olu Denis.  For a map look at this link http://www.uzumlu-villa.co.uk/html/google_ map_of_xanthos.htmlWe found the site fairly easily and there was a reasonable sized car park nearly empty quite late in the afternoon at Easter busier I imagine in peak season. If you are on holiday in the area I expect you will see trips to Xanthos advertised.Although a lot of the artefacts from xanthos are in the British museum there is a lot to see at the site some of which is still being excavated. There are noticeable Roman archaeological items at this site too.We spent about an hour and a half here and would like to revisit another time.This is quite a large archaeological site spreading two sides of the narrow road. There is a fee of a few lire about 3 or 4 pounds worth to enter the site which has wire fencing around it. However we did not notice this till we came out I expect there will be staff on gates in season.Although the paths around the site are quite narrow and a bit bumpy I think if you were disabled, determined and had support with you that you would manage some of the visit. However it would be difficult.A lot of the stones and buildings were in good condition and worth seeing the amphitheatre interesting as were the pillar tombs with inscriptions. The best known tomb being the Harpy tomb with its inscriptions on We crossed back over the road and found many other ruins a Roman-Byzantine Street and what is described as a row of shops. There are a few mosaics more are covered which we did not see.For more details go to http://www.lycianturkey.com/lycian_sites/xanthos.htm I looked here before we visited.I enjoyed our visit this site and the other Lycian sites locally are worth visiting. The view from this site over the valley and to the sea is good. Do bring a picnic and drink I did not see any available.I just read that there is a kiosk selling non alchoholic drinks we did not see it though. Good shoes or sturdy sandals are advisable     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6390014:3:::6781956:3:::6829585:3:::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5285637:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6866291:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5203100:4:::5816422:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5439461:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6887858:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Asda and Sainsbury   s own cheap flour costs the same. Home pride plain flour costs 1.48 for 1 kg.I buy Tesco value plain flour for my baking., because I usually shop there due to its position being more convenient than the other stores.I find the results using this value flour as good as the when I use a more expensive flour.The flour comes in a boring white paper bag/packet with a red top and bottom and red writing, it has a small section of Tesco   s blue value stripes. I open my bag by tearing open the top seam. I do not store my flour in a separate flour container in my cupboard it is fine kept in its bag. With the top folded over.This is unbleached white flour. Made from wheat it does contain gluten and has 335 kcal per 100g. This flour looks as you would expect it   s a white powder.I did not put my nose in to smell it as I did not want a white nose.Flour does not have much smell.I use this plain flour in my baking making pastry and crumbles, Yorkshire puddings and crumbles. If I bake a cake with it I add baking powder as a raising agent. I also use this flour to make play dough for the children.Although maybe not the finest of flour I rarely find lumps in it unless I leave it unopened in a damp place. If it is lumpy I can always sieve it.Do be careful so that you do not spill this flour as it will make a white powdery mess everywhere. Talking about mess and flour, this is a good flour to use to make those flour bombs. Please throw them outside.

       " '5247778::::Striped Bloody Cranesbill::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::22.05.2011::::    Striped Bloody Cranesbill /Geranium sanguineum*CranesbillsThe cranesbills are members of the geranium/Geraniaceae family. There are many geraniums ranging from the wild herb Robert to the cultivated geraniums. The Geranium is easily confused with the Pelargonium also a member of the Geranium/Geraniaceae family, at one time the two were combined as the same genus but were spirited in 1789.I have known people get snotty when occasionally call a pelargonium a geranium and think they know better than me. (What s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet.)*Striped Bloody Cranesbill.+Care and positionStriped bloody cranesbill is a hardy plant and needs little careAny way I have a Striped Bloody Cranesbill in my garden. It has been there for many years. Given to me by my Dad a plant he had separated from one of his own.The  Striped Bloody Cranesbill seems to like my well drained chalk soil they also liked my dads clay soil. Mine grow well in a sunny spot and a partially shaded spot.+Appearance This Perennial ( long-lived grows many years) plant will grow as a mound to about 23cm/9 in tall 30cm/12 in wide.+ LeavesI like the leaves of this plant they are palmate which means like a hand they have many frond like divisions. The grey green leaves turn a red colour in the autumn.+FlowersThe flowers appear in May and June through to August .The nearly flat slightly cup shaped flowers has 5 pink petals which have darker pink stripes. The flowers are about 3 or 4 cm/1.1/4 or 1.1/2 inches in diameter. I have this pale pink variety and a darker pink one in my garden the darker pink one does have so darker veins stripes on the leaves but they are not very distinct, so may just be called Bloody Cranesbill. I think there is a white variety too.*The seeds. The seeds are formed in a seed pod which looks like a cranes bill, hence the name. Bloody either comes from the red that the leaves go in autumn or possibly for the red vein like stripes.+PurchaseYou can buy this plant in garden centres where you will get it for between    5 and    10 or on line at http://www.crocus.co.uk  where it sells for    7.99.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5285637:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::3957:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6866291:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5203100:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6876907:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6887858:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::That's Not My Tiger... - Usborne Publishing::::Books::::40::::very helpful::::14.05.2011::::    That   s not my Tiger is a book in a series of    That   s not my    books by Usborne books. It was released in June 2010.I was reading this book this week when we visited our school library .This book is a board book of 10(12 including the cover pages) very sturdy thick pages. It measures 16.2 x 16 x 2.2 cm.This book has wipe clean surfaces which is essential in a  book for a messy baby or child. I have known our book get licked and chewed basically slobbered on and it is easy to wipe over with a damp cloth and   the book is  quite resistant to a gentle chew.This book is suitable for babies and children from birth upwards I think a 2, 3 or 4 year old would still enjoy it. I work with special needs children and this book is very suitable for children who need more than pictures and words to enable them to access the book.Each double page is boldly coloured and has a picture of a tiger on it.  The tiger is orange with brown stripes. Each double page has a little white mouse get your child to find and point to the mouse. On the first of each double page there are the words    That   s not my Tiger    on the opposite side are the words which tell how this tiger is different either its ears are too fluffy its tail is so soft, its tongue is too rough and so on. Each picture of the tiger has a small sensory are that relates to the words and the feel. On the page where its ears are too fluffy there is a white fluffy fabric piece inserted into the ear. Or where the tongue is there is a rough pink fabric. On the last double page we find the right tiger. As I said earlier these board books are very tough if your child is reading on their own, but I am sure you will all be reading this with your child feeling the sensory areas and encouraging your child to touch them and feel the difference.  Babies love to hear voices, reading a story is a good way of calming and soothing a baby talking in a gentle voice. sitting with your child  on your knee or cuddled up next to you is a good way of bonding when reading  this book to your child you are giving  your child your full attention.A baby learns about the world by touching and feeling so letting him/her touch and feel the different textures in the book to learn about them and then finding things which are the same texture. The rubber squeaky toy is soft so is the blanket, teddy is fluffy and so is the cat. With my pupils I have feely bags of different textures to find texture that are the same, or different.While you are reading this book your child is learning the different words for textures good for language development. Reading a book with a child from an early age is the beginning of being able to read. An understanding that books are fun, that books contain information and eventually that those regular lines and shapes are words. Children love repetition and it is good that the first words are repeated through out the book. Your child will expect those words and then the joy of finding how the tiger is different.My early years special needs pupils really enjoy this book. I let the child turn the page over. I will need to take the hand of some of them to the textured part of the page others will find it for themselves. I will get my children to tell me how it feels or I will say the word and hope the child repeats it after meThis book is useful when we are doing a topic on animalsThe Author is Fiona Watt the Illustrator: Rachel Wells.This books RRP IS    5.99 Tesco are selling it for    4.49,    4.79 at Waterstones.    4.93 at Amazon.I have reviewed the hardcover board book but I think it is also available as a paperback.Yes I would recommend this book and the others in the series        ::::5633146:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5285637:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6885623:4:::6885623:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6857875:4:::6857875:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6840580:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6757811:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6866291:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6887858:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

This value turner matches the other cooking utensils such as the slotted spoon..This turner is only available in black it is made from a plastic nylon type material. The turner is 12 inches /30 cm long it has a hole at the top of the handle should you wish to hang it on a hook. I keep mine along with my assortment of kitchen tools in a draw.. The top 12 cm/4.1/2 inches of the handle is slightly thicker than the rest. There is also  a small ridged grip area  so it does not slip out of your hands when turning that egg over.  The handle continues for another 9cm/3.1/2 inches till it flattens out. The business end of the turner is 4 inches 9     cm long 3 in/ 7cm wide and has 5 long slots in it these help  drain all that excess fat off the fired egg. The turner is slightly flexible. My value turner is a couple of years old now and the edges of the business end a little scuffed I expect this is due to hot fat.Now I do not eat many fried eggs but this is a handy tool for when I do . It is also useful for assisting to lift omelettes out of the pan. I use this for lifting other items out of the pan too.Yes I would recommend this tool its cheap, does the job.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Dusters::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::19.05.2011::::    Dust dust, dust, I get it all over my house, so clean it I must. To dust I use old T shirts which I have cut to size and bought yellow dusters. Just recently I bought myself some Tesco value dusters, a three pack for 69p. The slightly better non value dusters cost    1.67 for 3.These dusters are presented in as clear plastic bag.These dusters are not quite square measuring approx 38 by 32cm. This size is fine for  my dusting needs.They are a yellow 100  cotton cloth with red blanket stitches around the edges. Very traditional looking.These dusters are not the thickest dusters I have ever seen.They are soft not fluffy, just soft.I have bought these dusters and used previously I use these dusters to dust and polish my shelves and furniture.I find these dusters fine for a quick dust over surfaces. I use one to dust my T V screen, I use one to dust my computer cabinet. They are ok if used to rub spray polish into wood.

       " '5247778::::Tesco High Baked Water Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::16.05.2011::::    I like a biscuit with my cheese I prefer a water biscuit to a cracker. I usually do my shopping in Tesco its more convenient for me So naturally I buy the Tesco high baked water biscuit (200g) Why not Carr   s which are also on sale at Tesco well because Carr   s water biscuits cost    1..49 for  the same weight.Not all water biscuits are called high baked  I guess Tesco just added that . It means they are baked at a high temperature I assume not that they are baked on a high mountain or bakery, biscuits need a high temperature to bake atLooking at price comparison for the same weight I notice that Sainsbury   s water biscuits cost 69 p Ocado   s  63p Asda   s 70p. I also notice that cream crackers are cheaper 25p for 200g in Tesco so to save money I might switch to cream crackers with my cheese.Back to Tesco water biscuits. They are presented in a blue paper wrapper with a picture of a cream cracker embellished with cream cheese and a tomato.These are a round  biscuit about 6 cm in diameter, a good size for a snack biscuit.These biscuits have been baked to a golden brown. They are quite thin and very crispy they have a few bubbles of air in them but are not as crumbly and layered as a cream cracker.It is possible to spread margarine/soft butter on them without breaking the biscuit. I do not have these on mine to keep the fat down. I would not recommend these biscuits for spreading activities for children as the biscuits break to easily use a digestive instead. The taste is quite bland slightly wheat a taste that will go with any topping. Carr   s more expensive are a slightly better taste.I like just a huge chunk of good cheddar cheese with mine. But equally they are good with any cheese. A soft cheese either a diet one or a full fat one with or without garlic and herbs. A sliced tomato or onion rings on top goes well too.These biscuit   s are good with a variety of toppings maybe ham or a pate plus some salad. You can be as inventive as you like these are good for party or tea time food  They contain 401 kcal per 100g.  22  kcal each. They are made with wheat flour and vegetable oil suitable for vegetarians but not those with wheat allergies. Tesco tells me they may also contain sesame seeds.After opening the packet they need to be stored in an air tight container or they go soft. Yes I like these biscuits     ::::5891:3:::5891:3:::6699566:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5285637:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6145850:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::3957:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6838035:4:::6838035:4:::6826738:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6800944:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6887858:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6689426:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6866291:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5518249:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6816341:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6834688:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5954627:4:::5954627:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Solidaster / Golden Rod::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::16.05.2011::::    I recently separated some of my Golden rod/ Solidago roots and potted them into some plant pots leaving the original plant a bit smaller. I looked at the plant pots and discover all the roots are taken well and I now have several new plants. I shall probably give these to the school fete to sell.Golden rod is a majestic perennial from the Asteraceae daisy family.  It has green narrow leaves that grow on alternate sides to the thick stem. Towards the top of the stem which can grow as high as 6 ft/182 cm tall (depending on the variety) small sprays of golden yellow flowers. These flowers are really bright. Flowering in August and September this plant is best at the back of a herbaceous border its spikes of stems with golden flowers brightening up the garden.This plant likes a sunny position. It will survive a poor sandy or chalky soil so good for my chalky Chiltern garden. I do not need to give my established plant much care I sometimes stake the blooms or they flop over when caught by the wind. Once planted the plants should last for many years. They are easy to propagate by the roots or seed. If the flower heads are not cut when they die then they will self set seeds in the flower border.This is a good plant for the wildlife garden as the flowers attract many hoverflies, little beetles and spiders. Golden rod is good as a cut flower it will give height to the autumn displays I can remember mum using it a lot at home and for the church.Smell well  it does have  a bit of a pong not really as pleasant one a bit musty like old socks..I believe Golden rod is an American species introduced here. It is a wild plant of the roadside in America.Apparently golden rod has medical properties I am not qualified to give those but I found several websites including   http://www.healthywaymagazine.com/issue35/11_.html and http://medicinewomansroots.blogspot.com/2007/02/goldenrod-new-uses-for-old-friend_22.html if you wish to look.To buy some look in the gardecentre or on line atAccording to old folk law if you have some  by the front door it  is said to attract prosperityBlondie wrote these lyrics to the song Golden rod  on her album The curse of Blondie in 2003What s that pretty flower I see?Tall and wild it waves at meMother says it s just a weedGolden Rod, Golden Rod     ::::6829585:3:::5518249:3:::5633146:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5285637:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6888593:4:::6888593:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6845486:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6887858:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5816422:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5217069:4:::5217069:4:::6699566:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6866291:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Suttons Bean (Runner) Seeds - Scarlet Emperor::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::15.05.2011::::    This weekend I meant to sow the last of my runner beans, I did not get round to it as we had visitors. Still I can sow them up to the end of June. I bought these Suttons Scarlet Emperor runner bean seeds from a local garden centre they cost me    2.65. I planted my first ones in April they need to be planted after the frosts.There are 50 seeds in a packet plenty to make a couple of sowings and give plenty of beans.. I rip open the large paper envelope that the seeds come in and see the   large 2cm long bean it is a black with mauve markings really quite attractive. I always sow my bean seeds about 38mm deep in pots in my green house. I have grown them outside in ready position but find that they get slugged, yum yum slugs love eating them.I water them keeping them moist and they will germinate in a week to two of weeks. Once they have grown a few inches tall I will plant them outside. I make a wigwam out of canes and plant the beans at the base. I will secure the bean to the pole with a tie so it does hot get blown down. Eventually the bean stalk will twine itself around the pole. They will grow to about 2 metres tall. I have also grown these up straight canes too. I weed around when necesarry.I continue to water these plants they will grow tall up my cane and flower. They have red flowers some runner bean variety has white flowers.  These flowers are attractive to both me and white butterflies bees pollinate them. The plants need plenty of water for the  beans to  develop.After a while small beans will be seen forming they will get longer and then harvest them they mature about 12 to 15 inches long From sowing to maturity takes about 12 to 16 weeks. These beans germinate and crop fairly well I have had this variety before.These beans are great as a vegetable with many meals , they do not need podding you slice the green  bean and steam or boil it for about 15 minutes. . You can not eat them raw they contain harmful toxin Phytohaemagglutin in which is destroyed by cooking.   Raw beans will give you dreadful stomach ache. If I have a glut of beans I can freeze them. Lots of recipes at http://everything-runnerbean.com/cooking-and-eating.html Suttons Scarlet Emperor Runner beans would be a good one to grow with children you could link it to Jack and the beanstalk. If you get a  see through jar  fill it with water screw a paper towel in it and then place a  bean  so you can see it through the jar and the bean will quite quickly split and grow roots.   Good for showing and explaining about growing, have a bean in a jar that does not have water too does it grow ?  No why not.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5285637:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6880805:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5655857:4:::5655857:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6866291:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6845486:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5203100:4:::6887858:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Rachels Organic Luxury Greek Style Bio-Live Yogurt with Honey::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::15.05.2011::::    I had some Rachel   s Greek style organic honey yoghurt a couple of weeks ago. Although I like Rachel   s yoghurts I usually use another brand as I usually find Rachel   s more expensive. Tesco are selling the large 420g pot for    1.89 two for    3.00 at the moment Yeo honey yoghurt is    1.55. just looked at my supermarket on line its 94p in Asda.Rachel   s Yoghurts come from a Welsh dairy and are organic the pots they use are made from recycled plastic. Their Ethos is one I totally agree with.I am not sure what the difference between Greek style and other ways yoghurts are made , but obviously the Greeks have a slightly different process.Rachel   s honey yogurt is presented in a plastic pot with a card sleeve giving nutritional info. The design on the card sleeve is slightly classier than Yeo or Tesco yoghurts. Putting my spoon in I help myself to a serving.  I find the yoghurt a nice  creamy colour . The yoghurt is a fairly thick but still a pouring consistency, I taste some yoghurt the taste is quite creamy its fresh and yoghurt and yes I can discern the honey flavour. It is a mild flavour not too sweet, not as strong a honey flavour as other honey yoghurts that I have experienced. This is a very pleasant flavour. I do eat yoghurt on its own but I also like yoghurt to add to foods I do not think this honey one would go with my curry tonight but it is good to use instead of cream on apple pie I like yoghurt on my cereal in the morning I prefer a vanilla or honey one to a plain also better than a  fruit one. The flavour of this Rachel   s honey yoghurt subtle not overpowering goes well with fresh fruit such as strawberries and raspberries. This yoghurt contains less than 10  fat.  There are 137 kcal per 100g It is unsuitable for those with dairy allergies as it is made with cows milk. It is free from gluten and suitable for vegetarians.Keep in the fridge and once open eat within 3 days, that   s no problem in our house     ::::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5285637:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6506577:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5261772:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6836599:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6699566:4:::6866291:4:::6239059:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6874894:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6840580:4:::5203100:4:::6887858:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I find shortbread is often given to me as a Christmas gift.I have just finished a 250g box of an assortment of Walkers shortbread biscuits.I find the packaging of walker.s shortbreads always attractive its traditional red plaid and pictures of Scottish scenes   This box has the traditional red tartan and a sash of a blue/green tartan by the side of the picture of the shortbread biscuits. Joseph walker started making shortbread in 1898 in Scotland and the family still produces fine shortbread there.There are 3 styles /shapes of shortbread biscuit in this box. There are shortbread fingers, rounds and triangles. Each golden biscuit has little prick marks in it. The rounds and the triangles have marked edging like fork marks. These biscuits look attractive I personally prefer the rounds which do you prefer?I like it that these biscuits have not got masses of sugar which has been dredged on the top of them. These biscuits are each a good size they are quite a thick substantial biscuit.I have a bite they are sweet yet not oversweet, they are buttery. The biscuit crumbles into my mouth. These shortbread are good a natural flavour.I like these shortbread biscuits with a cup of tea, but I have also served them with a fresh fruit dessert they go well with strawberries or a rhubarb fool.In 100g of shortbread there are 517 calories they also Contains Gluten, Wheat, Wheat Flour   Milk and may contain NutsSadly all my shortbread biscuits are gone now At http://www.goodfoodoutlet.com/walkers-shortbread-assortment-250g-on-offer-p88051  they cost  only    2.76 At the my supermarket website only 1 supermarket  seem to stock them at the present time  see  http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/ocado- where they cost    3,45. However if you can not get this specific box of biscuits there are many more boxes of Walkers shortbreads available.Thanks for reading, just off to see if I have a shortbread biscuit left somewhere     ::::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5439461:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5285637:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5806017:4:::5806017:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6866291:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6190414:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6870095:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6887858:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The 6 cakes are packaged in a card box. The box is easy to open. I picked up one of the round cakes it had chocolatly buttery icing on top ,t curls of milk and dark chocolate was  scattered  on top if  it. Underneath the chocolate butter cream icing topping was chocolate sponge. Each of these chocolate cakes looked as if they were 2 circular discs cut out of a larger cake and then sandwiched together with chocolate butter cream filling.The cake tasted good. The chocolate sponge is a good flavour nothing really exceptional though just a good chocolate sponge.  My sponge was quite moist. The butter cream filling tasted sweet and chocolatley a good butter cream. The pieces of chocolate decorating it were good too a good Thornton   s dark and a good Thornton   s milk chocolate. I enjoyed the taste of mine.  There was quite a lot of butter cream compared to the size of the cake.The size was just right I did not want to pig out on another .I finished my cake in about 4 bites. This mini chocolate cake satisfied my sweet and chocolate urge.So would I recommend? well yes  if you like chocolate cake and buttercream.Each mini cake contains 175 calories so not good for my dietThese cakes were bought at Tesco where they cost    1.80, that   s 30p a cake Asda and Sainsbury   s are also selling for this price     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5661865:3:::5661865:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5261772:3:::6657747:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::6691451:3:::6403007:3:::6403007:3:::6834688:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5439461:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5285637:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6887858:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6880805:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5790028:4:::6887646:4:::6887646:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6816341:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6866291:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Suttons Spring Onion - White Lisbon::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::08.05.2011::::    Suttons Onion Seed (Salad) Seeds - White Lisbon    I have recently sown some Suttons white Lisbon salad onion seeds. I have bought and sown this seeds merchant   s white Lisbon seeds other years too.Sutton seeds were first established by 1806 by John Sutton in Reading. Now I believe they are based in Devon. I have bought many different packets of Sutton   s seeds   before and find them reliable in germination and development provided they are given the right conditions of course.I bought my packet of salad onion seeds from a supermarket for    1.49. These seeds can be bought from many outlets, garden centers, hardware stores and supermarkets.It certainly is more economical to grow your own salad  onions than to buy them at Tesco I bought about 10 salad  onions in a bunch the other day cost 70p they looked like a white Lisbon onion so if I were to sow all my onion seed and eat them instead of buying  I would be saving several poundsThe seeds are packaged inside an outer foil lined paper envelope that has pictures of the onion on it and instructions for sowing and care.I had previous to sowing these seeds dug, raked and made a thin trench about     inch/ just over 1 cm deep. I just tore across the top of the packet and poured a few onion seeds into my hand. I thinly sowed these along the seed trench thinly. Then I covered over and watered. I did not use all the seeds in the packet according to Suttons there are approx 550 seeds so I sealed the pack for future sowings.The onion seeds are tiny little black round seeds I try to sow them thinly, however they still come up too close so I thin them out a little. I watered my onions regularly and it took about 2 weeks to see the thin green grasslike onion leaves growing above ground,My onions are not ready to pull yet , shame I should  have sown them earlier. These seeds can be sown  in the autumb.  Salad onions only take 10 weeks to  mature be a good size to mature. Use your own judgment you know the size of a salad onion you want to eat. I tens to sow a row of onion seeds every few weeks to keep me in supply the whole summer.I lightly loosen the soil around the onion then pull it up. I then cut of the roots and remove the very outer skin this outer skin often goes grey and papery. If the top of the green leaves looks tatty then I might remove then.I will harvest all my onions before they set flower as then the inner stem of the onion goes hard. These onions are good to eat I know as I have had them previous years. They are a mild tasting onion.So how do I eat my onion  gt; well I might just have it whole with a salad or a cheese sandwich. I sometimes chop them up and add to an egg or cheese dish to just give that hint of flavour.Growing my own I do not pick too many at a time they will store in the fridge for a few days but not too long.Yes these seeds are good if you do not have a garden you could always grow them in a container full of soil     ::::5285637:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6781956:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5790028:4:::6752066:4:::6752066:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::3957:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6843233:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5347743:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6866291:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6887156:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6830048:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Aqua Princess Hotel, Kas::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::05.05.2011::::    Aqua princess  Kas TurkeyDid you wonder where I went just before Easter? probably not, however I shall tell you about the Hotel Aqua Princess in Kas Turkey where I have been staying.  My husband booked this hotel on line through travel republic for 10 days and we booked the flight separately. The hotel cost     227.55 for two people staying half bourd  for 9 nights  last night was  the thursday before good friday for the 9 nights just before Easter .We arrived at the hotel about 6 o   clock on the Wednesday evening in our hire car. We had previously checked on line and also had a map to help us find it. Finding the Aqua Princess was fairly easy as it was the last hotel on the coast road going out of Kaz.We parked in the small amount of parking opposite the front of the hotel. As it was Easter and early in the season there was no problem with us parking there everyday I imagine in high season it might be more of a problem. We got out of the car and looked at the hotel it was a tall thin building. I noticed lots of steps. The reception was in a small cabin like room at the front of the hotel looked like an add on. There was someone inside who greeted us we exchanged information and  he gave us our keys     no problem  he carried my suitcase and escorted us   up, up the outside stairway (no lift)We now reached a flat terrace area with  seating and a pool. We went through the open doorway into a small bar area then up some more stairs. These stairs then opened out onto the first floor  and bedrooms , however we were not  on this floor so up ,up, up the narrow stairs we went to the second floor  thank goodness our  room was on this floors we did not have to go up to the third floor.We were briefly shown our room and how to work things then we were left on our own.First thing I did was crash out on the double bed. Bedroom~~~~~The bed was quite comfortable not to soft and saggy. I surveyed the room it was square the double bed central with heads board against one wall. Enough room about a metre all around the other 3 sides of the bed.  A bedside table was next to each side of the bed with bedside lamps on, a low wooden unit on one side of the room and a wardrobe at the bottom of the bed. Windows are on one side of the room and a door to the small balcony.There was a heater over the top of the door that we could use if we got cold, we did use it a couple of times          Pictures of Aqua Princess Hotel, Kas     ::::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5633146:4:::5285637:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6882625:4:::6882625:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5655857:4:::5655857:4:::6691451:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5805660:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5203100:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6292077:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6879236:4:::6879236:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6887156:4:::6781956:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6887858:5:::5511950:5:::5511950:5:::5997493:5:::5997493:5:::6860710:5:::6860710:5:::6413336:5:::6413336:5:::6403007:5:::6403007:5:::6845153:5:::6840867:5:::6840867:5:::6866291:5:::5515635:5:::5515635:5:::6880805:5:::6220775:5:::6220775:5:::6860964:5:::6860964:5:::6840624:5:::6840624:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Fresh Frozen Very Fine Whole Green Beans::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.05.2011::::    I have just finished eating my evening meal it was a beef casserole with a serving of Tesco frozen very fine whole green beans.I have these frozen green beans in my freezer after buying them at Tesco a couple of weeks ago. They cost 78p for the 1 kg bag.I had opened the green plastic bag with a picture of a knob of butter melting on   the pictures of green beans. I sealed it again for my freezer by putting a peg on it. If the bag is not sealed by a freezer tie or clip I find them loose beans get into my freezer.These beans are thin long ones with the ends cut of so although some are broken they are not short pieces of cut bean but measure around 12cm / 5 inches long.They are not a flat runner bean but a green bean with more of a cylindrical pod.Now I cooked my green beans in the microwave for about 4 minutes.  If cooked on the hob they do not need much longer. Full instructions are available on the bag. Do not cook to long as they go soggy and horrible.Serving these beans I notice they have kept a   fair green colour.*Taste  Well they are frozen vegetables so do not taste as good as fresh green beans. They do taste fine though. They work well as a vegetable which is easy to cook. I can not really describe the green bean flavour in words.* Recipes.Well basically they go fine as a vegetable with most meat dishes I think they compliment bacon /ham/pork well. I found a website with lots of recipes using frozen green beans including one for a vegetable bake or a green bean and sausage casserole.*Nutrition There   s not much in these beans no vitamins no fat  only 21 cal per 80g which is about a serving  Basically these green beans are a good frozen vegetable.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6880805:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5020054:4:::5020054:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5805660:4:::5203100:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6145850:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6691451:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6292077:4:::6887246:4:::6887246:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6866291:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::5816422:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6845153:4:::6887398:4:::6887398:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Onion::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::02.05.2011::::     I know my Onion   s?Allium cepa spring onion , brown cooking onion, shallots, red onions , white onions  White Lisbon giant Stuttgarter, Ailsa Craig., then of course there   s chives or ornamental onions grown for the flower.Well I think I know a little about onions. I have seen them grown and grow them myself in the garden for over 55 years. My parents used to grow them my mum cooked them I HATED onions the taste was disgusting, when mum chopped them onions made me cry. So I thought till I was about 11 years old when I began to like the taste of onions.I am growing some white Lisbon salad onions in my garden at the moment sowed them about 3 or 4 weeks ago and they are showing through the soil like little blades of grass. Most seed merchants sell white Lisbon onion seeds. I think my packet was a Sutton seeds one but it might have been Unwin s. I bought my packet at a local garden centre but I have seen onion seeds on sale in supermarkets too. A packet of spring onion seeds will cost you about    1.50-   2.00 Suttons are    1.69 I think some supermarket seeds are under a pound. There are about 500 seeds in a packet of Sutton   s spring onions so if you like onions in your salad. I would recommend you find a small space to grow some as it costs 72p for a bunch of about 12 spring salad onions in Tesco.* Growing onionsOnions can be grown from seed in September. I prefer to sow mine in early spring. its good to grow a few at a time then a couple of weeks later sow a few more  for  adding onions to salads all summer. Just sow a few seeds thinly about 2 cm deep, thin them out if they are growing too close. Water well. They only take 8 to 10 weeks to get to a size big enough for salad. Gently fork around the onions you wish to pull up or you will only get the green leaf not the bulb.It is possible to buy red spring onion seed too I have grown these previous years and they look really attractive on a salad plate.*Brown onions.These are the ones I use in casseroles.My dad used to grow his main crop onions from seed  starting September or October I have grown them from sets which are  very small onion bulbs which you plant just under the soil in spring   usually march. However they take up quite a bit of room in the garden and basic cooking onions are cheap in the shops. Red onions can be grown in the same way.*Red onionsThese are similar to brown onions except that they are red. They are really attractive I have used these to decorate flavour salads. Adds colour to many green dishes.Since  red onions are more expensive in the supermarket I think gtowing these  is good, the seeds are not much if any more expensive than the brown ones* Shallots are the onions which are longer than round. Dad used to grow these. *Pickling onionsNot me I still do not like many pickles it   s the vinegar. These onions are a small brown strong tasting onion. I have memories of mum steeping these in vinegar and dad eating them with a cheese sandwich.These are just a few of the onion variety.Onions are quite easy to grow. If the weather is dry water them as you will get a bigger bulb*Cooking with onionsThe onions that I have grown are for salads but I use onions regularly in casseroles, I have made onion soup and onion bread, I use them in a cous cous recipe lots of recipes at http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/onion*HealthyNot only do onions make your food tastier they are good for you . Well mum always said they were good for colds and flu. .More recent research has found other benefits too.Quercitin is an antioxidant found in onions and  they are high in vitamin C and chromium  they also contain vitamin B 6, vitamin A, calcium and phosphorus. Onions also have antiseptic.

       " '5247778::::Genpa Kas Turkey::::Shopping::::40::::very helpful::::27.04.2011::::    This last couple of weeks we have been on holiday in Kas Turkey, Kas is a small seaside town that used to be a fishing village but tourism is taking over. There are several hotels and private lettings also a camping site we had half board. We did not really need to buy many supplies mainly fruit bread and cheese we also bought a few gifts to bring home.One of the shops we stopped at and shopped in a couple of times was the Genpa store. Genpa is a Turkish chain of shops.We found this shop fairly easily when we drove into Kas.  The Genpa supermarket was not in the shops by the coastal roads but set further back.This shop is not a huge supermarket more like a small convenience supermarket .with three or 4 aisles of goods.I walked past the aisle selling a couple of small barbeques and cooking utensils, cleaning items, washing up liquid, washing powder.If you need disposable nappies for a baby then this shop sells them, there is also ladies sanitary wear here.Forgotten your toothbrush and toothpaste? Yes they are sold here.If you are camping and want either some tinned food or fresh meat to barbeque then a selection is sold here.Biscuits and snacks are available too.We could have bought wine here but did not.So what did I buy? Well we bought some  prepacked cheese for our picnic and a precooked packed sausage for another day we bought a packet of crisps, we bought a packet of some Turkish  tea to bring home as a present. The  last of the big spenders eh. During our time in Turkey we did not visit many supermarkets often so I can not really comment on the price comparisons. The prices here did seem similar to the ones in The Migros supermarket of a similar size in Kas.Its difficult to compare the prices in Turkey to the UK but a pack of 40 Huggies size 4 cost 11.90 Turkish lire, a lire being about    2.20. The cheese we bought a 400g pack cost 5.15 Turkish lire.When we visited the shop was not very busy. There were only a couple of tills in the shop. I found the staff friendly although those we met spoke no English, us no Turkish.Our experience of shopping here was fine no problem.I hope this review is useful should you be visiting Kas on holiday and wonder about shop   s. This is not the only small supermarket in the town there is the Migros which we also visited its very similar and I believer there are a couple of other small supermarkets too.     ::::6864647:3:::6864647:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::6005265:3:::6005265:3:::5439461:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::5261772:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5655857:3:::5655857:3:::6879236:3:::6879236:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::5633146:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6845486:4:::6853095:4:::6743330:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6845153:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6506577:4:::6691451:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6866291:4:::6145850:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::5805660:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5203100:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Fresh Frozen Baby Broad Beans::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::30.04.2011::::    My broad bean plants are in flower in the garden   but no beans yet, never mind I had some frozen Tesco baby broad beans in the freezer.These beans are available in a 750g bag. They usually cost    1.23 but at the moment cost    1.00 so I shall go to Tesco to replace the bag I have just finished. The    1.00 price is till 02/05/2011 One reason that I shall be buying more is that my 5 year old granddaughter likes them and it is often difficult to get children to eat vegetables, my 8 year old grandson does not like them. All the adults in the family like broad beans.These beans come in a bright green bag ready shelled from that furry pod. To open the bag you really need scissors or a blade to pierce the plastic.  Ready podded the frozen ones save time.I open my bag then pour the amount I think that I need into a bowl then I microwave them for about 4 minutes they need about 20 minutes if not micro waved.These broad beans are a small size picked before they get old.These beans are a dull green not a bright one as in the picture. I serve broad beans as a vegetable with many meals .I think they go especially well with gammon or bacon. There are many recipes for broad beans at http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/grapevine mostly for fresh but I think frozen would substitute quite well.I have known children refuse broad beans before because of the slightly tougher skin that surrounds it. I have been known to try and tempt children to taste by removing this outer skin.How do I describe the taste? difficult. The taste is distinctive but not too strong baby broad beans taste sweeter than old broad beans. These Tesco ones are a nice flavour.Info for dieters there are 59 kcal per 100g     ::::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6800944:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5470165:4:::5470165:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5790028:4:::5066097:4:::5066097:4:::6826738:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5439461:4:::6843584:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6866291:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6817953:4:::6817953:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Dried Basil::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::29.04.2011::::    Tesco dried Basil. I have a jar of this in my herb shelf. I do prefer to use fresh basil but sometimes do not have any handy when I need it. I looked at my supermarket and the 16g jar of basil costs 45p. A jar keeps quite a long time so I think this was a good buy.This Basil comes in a square based glass jar like the other Tesco herbs and spices it fits well on my herb/spice rack.The flip up lid lifts to reveal a sprinkler hole.The dried basil has been chopped very fine. The leaves that are bright green when fresh have dried a dark green brown.Opening the lid I get an aroma Basil smells a little like aniseed, liquorice, fennel it   s a green herby smell.So how do I use my Tesco dried Basil?If I am using the dried basil I will use less than if I am using fresh as the flavour is more concentrated. I usually find 1 heaped teaspoon of dried basil enough for most dishes.I add it to several dishes. I really like tomato salad with olive oil drizzles over it and basil added Basil adds a great flavour to tomatoes.I also make a cous cous dish using dried tomatoes, chicken stock, onions and basil.I sometimes add some to a chicken or beef dish.  I find the flavour of Tesco dried basil as good as other brands of dried basil that I have used.Looking at the label of the jar in front of me I notice that it may contain traces of nut or sesame seeds due to the factory it is produced in.It is best to store this and all dried herbs in a cool dark dry place stops the product deteriorating quickly. I store mine in a rack inside the door of my store cupboard. Would I recommend Tesco dried basil? Yes I have been satisfied with the results when I have used it. I do prefer fresh basil though.     ::::5719918:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6884301:3:::6884301:3:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6845153:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6800944:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6190414:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840580:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6654507:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6750576:4:::6830048:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families - Chocolate Rabbit Family::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.04.2010::::    .                                                                                                      For my granddaughters birthday along with the Silvanian caravan and car we bought our granddaughter the Silvanian Chocolate Rabbit family. I must admit it was quite hard to choose which Silvanian animals to buy as they all are so adorable to look at. These rabbits are suitable for children aged 4 years old, our granddaughter a month away from her 4th birthday .When my granddaughter opened her Sylvanian chocolate rabbit family as well as the toys she had information about this family telling her about this family of rabbits who make chocolates They all have names and characters that the company has made up. I prefer it that she makes up her own stories and characters for these toys.The Sylvanian Chocolate Rabbit family includes Father Frasier rabbit, Mother Teri, Brother Coco and Brother Coco. In a separate purchase we also bought the Chocolate Rabbit family twin babies.These Rabbits are small creatures made with a flocked furry fabric. You might have expected a chocolate brown rabbit family, but no they are a creamy white with brown tips to their ears. They are detailed with pink inner ears and brown dot eyes and a little pink nose and they have little furry tails. The tallest rabbit measures about 9 cm the smallest about 5 cms. The arms and legs of these toys are moveable This family are all clothed Daddy wearing red trousers a yellow check shirt, mummy a long red dress with an apron on. The girl rabbit a red and white spotted dress, the boy yellow trousers and a red check shirt.  The clothes are removable so that the rabbits can be undressed and dressed again They all stand independently fairly well. My granddaughter overwhelmed by all these toys opened the packets and sadly the tail fell of one of the rabbits almost immediately, she had really only just got it out of the packaging, she was very stoical about it and my daughter put that rabbit and the tail out of play. My daughter emailed the company and they sent her a new family, not just the one rabbit to replace. My daughter has kept the other rabbit and tail and thinks she will be able to super glue it on again. Sadly another of the rabbits has now lost its tail too so I think this must be a weak point as my granddaughter is not rough with her toys.This rabbit family and the other Sylvaianian toys are great for developing imaginative play. I love to play with my granddaughter and her toys watching and listening   to her, This family of rabbits do all the things humans do My granddaughter takes them on holiday in the caravan sits them in the car she pretend washes them sits them on the little toilet she feeds them all sorts of pretend delicacies, and of course the children chocolate rabbits are naughty they get sent to their bedroom. My granddaughter does talk normally with these chocolate rabbits but she often puts on that squeaky soft voice when it is the rabbits talking. I can see my granddaughter enjoying these rabbits for several years and I am sure that her Sylvanian family will extend to other animal families and accessories.     We purchased our Silvanians at Amazon where they now cost    13.99 at Sainsbury   s they cost    14.99.    14.99 seems to be the usual price on most internet shop sites.*A little History The Silvanian family were first made in Japan in 1984 , in 1987 they were introduced to England first launched by Tomy and now  distributed by Flair.WouLd I recommend ? yes  even though their tails fell of i think they are adorable and so does my granddaughter .______________      ::::6882625:3:::6882625:3:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5719918:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5522492:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6825517:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::21963:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6757811:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5720245:4:::5720245:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6723034:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5477966:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5805376:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6831176:4:::6831176:4:::6786865:4:::6805797:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6750576:4:::6378505:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6733652:4:::6733652:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5335750:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6739162:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5816422:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::6820455:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Garlic & Coriander Mini Naan Breads::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.04.2011::::    For my supper tonight I shall be eating a home made curry with a mini Tesco   s coriander and garlic Naan bread.  There are 6 in the pack I shall be eating one.  The mini Naans are about     the size of the larger ones, they measure about 16 cm by 11 and are about 1 cm thick. I shall be having rice too so no need for a large Naan. There are 185k Cal in a mini Naan bread, I do not really need top eat more calories than that. The naans are a golden brown colour the specks of herbs can be seen. There seems to be a good scattering of the herbs. The herbs are coriander, fennel and parsley the garlic has been added as a puree. For those with allergies these Naan breads contain wheat flour and milkMay contain Nuts and sorry contains Gluten too.To cook these Naan breads  I will remove 2 from  the plastic packing , one for me one for him, put them  on a baking tray then in my oven preheated to 350    F /,Gas 4,180   C for 5 or 6  minutes. I could grill them for 2 minutes but my ovens on anyway. These Naan breads are not suitable for microwave cooking.I bought these Naan breads when they were on offer and froze them. The usual price is    1.08 that   s 18p each bread.There are enough calories in a mini Naan bread there are 185 k Cal, I do not really need to eat more calories than that so a mini naan is better than a large one. If yoyu prefer a larger  garlic and coriander naan the tesco make them 2 in a packet cost 55pThese Naan breads taste good soft and warm they puff up a little when you eat them soon after removing from the oven. I can taste the garlic and herbs in the bread. The garlic and coriander is not too strong a flavour. These breads go well with a curry.  They are ideal for mopping up that curry sauce. They are also ideal to serve at a party buffet, making easy finger food all you need is a dip or two to dip them into.  I shall go and put mine in the oven now as my curry is nearly cooked then while you are reading I shall be enjoying them.     ::::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6883404:3:::6883404:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5261772:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5587751:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6886167:4:::6886167:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6845153:4:::6866291:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Flair Sylvanian Families Beechwood Hall::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::05.03.2011::::    ______________________________________ I bought a rather nice house for my granddaughter. It is a very traditional house. It   s outside and interior walls are cream coloured and it has a red roof. I rather like the exterior balcony with railings running around the upper floor. This house has a name its called Beechwood hall, Beechwood hall is an updated version of willow hall houses. Sadly this grand house is only a Sylvanian people house suitable for those Sylvanian rabbits, dogs, bears and other animals to live in. The wildwood rabbits live in my daughter   s house. This is a plastic construction. This house is not really very big 20.5 x 65 x 36 cm. The size is an advantage as it does not take up a huge space in my granddaughter   s small bedroom. It   s a good size in proportion to the Sylvanian forest animals that get bought to live here.However each room, there are 5 is very small and the furniture we bought only just fits. (The house comes unfurnished)  When buying furniture it is best to be aware of the size. The widows are small paned and look perfect for the style of house. The floor is a dark wood colour ready for you to put rugs on or leave bare. Beechwood hall opens in half so you can play with the toys inside easily. When open for additional play space  2 pieces of flooring can be added , a triangular piece for upstairs there is a safety railing you can fir to this piece so that the sylvanian do mot fall of their landing and a piece  for downstairs too , the downstairs additional floor is wood colour one side green grass the other.  There are some stairs which do not come fixed so they can go onto the landing or any other part of the upstairs rooms.There are 5 rooms in Beechwood hall, 2 bedroom   s, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.As you can see from the pictures we have not yet completely furnished the house. It was a tight fit to get the bathroom in the smallest room my daughter wanted it in and the bathroom that we bought does not have a toilet, goodness knows where that will go when/if purchased. The childrens bedroom with bunk beds just fitted in the next smallest upstairs room. It is very difficult for the Sylvanian s to get through the linking doorway they go into the rooms easily by the landing. The main bedroom is yet to be furnished.Downstairs the kitchen furniture made the kitchen look welcoming, the chairs and table can go on the extension flooring or we can put it in the other downstairs room which we have yet to furnish.Two interchangeable lights come with this house you can position them in any room and they need 2 AA batteries. It is possible to buy another light pack if you wish.I think this house although a little small is well designed and well made it should last a long time. It   s only the sylvanian animals that I do not think very durable. None come with the house we had to buy our own family. Being plastic it should be easy to wash this house if it gets dirty. I really have fallen in love with this house and its accessories, looking forward to  my granddaughter getting it fully furnished. Each room cost between    10 and    20 to furnish and there are loads of accessories tooThe RRP of Beechwood hall is    65.95 , Tesco direct has it for    59.97  John Lewis for    59.95 http://www.toysrus.co.uk has it for    54.99  Sylvanian families first released in Japan by Epoch are now distributed in the UK by Flair. I think this Beechwood hall has a lot of play value when fully furnished and with a family resident.  I have played with it alongside my granddaughter quite a lot. The size means that it is transportable so although I have played with it at her house it   comes here sometimes when they visit. My granddaughter is using her fine and gross motor skills, not that she really needs to practice using them. Her imagination runs wild and the resident family lives a full life of ups and downs they get hurt mummy makes them better, they are naughty and get sent to the thinking step. They cook and eat their meals, go to school, go on holiday. This would be a good house for a play therapy session.  This toy is suitable for an over 4 year old. but be careful as although the house is very durable I do not think the animals are .Would I recommend this house? Yes     ::::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6750576:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5633146:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5261772:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6835564:4:::6835564:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::5347743:4:::6701923:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5285637:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6840580:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6844462:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5439461:4:::6866291:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6699566:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Flair Sylvanian Families - Friesian Cow Family::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::29.12.2010::::    Sylvanian Families Friesian Cow Family My granddaughter loves the sylvanian families and their homes for Christmas this year we bought her the Friesian Cow Family. The manufacturer Flair give all the different families names and each character  personalities This family are called the Buttercup  family  to read about these characters and their names and personalities http://www.elc.co.uk where they are being sold for    15 has the details. However I prefer a child to give the individual toy a name and personality through their play.  These Friesian cows are suitable for a child aged 4 and over. I think that they are suitable for a child who does not play with them in too robust a way I do not think they would take a lot of rough treatment.Included in the box with the family is a script telling you the animal   s names so my granddaughter does call her Friesian cows by those names. This Friesian cow family is made up of 4, mummy daddy a brother and sister. There are twin baby cows which you can buy separate to this family pack. These little cows are adorable the adults are only 6cm tall the children about 1 or 2 cm smaller. These cows are covered in a short flock fabric over a plastic body. The flock makes them soft to touch my granddaughter was stroking them. Each of the cows is black and white like a real Friesian cow. The inner ears are pink. Each ones marking   s are slightly different I think I prefer the way the black splodge   s are on Daddy cow. These toys do look quite like the real animals that they are representing.These cows are all dressed in fabric clothing which can be removed. The clothing is very country clothing. Sister Annabel  wearing a yellow gingham dress. Brother Paddock Buttercup is wearing blue dungarees. These cows are in a standing position. The feet flat based and the hands like mitts with a thumb. Their limbs and heads do move. So these cows will not be played with as cows but as humans who just happen to be cow shaped.  Houses, shops cars and many other    human    accessories can be bought to enhance the play of these cows and the other Sylvanian family animals. These toys will encourage imaginative role play. Listening to my grandchild playing with them she put on different voices for each family member. She was talking in her little girl voice telling the mother cow that her brother had been naughty.  She then sighed in another voice and mummy cow told the children to play nicely and Santa would visit. {I could just hear my grand daughter repeating something my daughter might have said}  I can see my granddaughter loving and playing with her Sylvanian family toys for several years.My granddaughter has a few other Sylvanian family toys and for her birthday one of the larger houses will be bought to try and keep them all together.  These cows and some of the other accessories are very small and easy to lose unless taken care of. The Sylvanian Friesian cows were a new addition to the Sylvanian families this year 2010. The first Sylvanian   s were made by Epoch  in Japan in 1985 the first ones seen in the UK in 1987. Distribution  of the Sylvanian families stopped to the USA and Canada in 1996, and by 1998 Sylvanian Families  were unavailable in the UK  in 1999 Flair reintroduced them. In the USA I believe they are called  Calico Critters I think these  Sylvanian Friesian cows are cute, I think they are a keeper. The R R P is    16  99 however you can buy them at http://www.amazon.co.uk for    9.98 .  You can read about these and the other sylvanian family toys at http://www.sylvanianfamilies-online.com. The Friesian cows cost    14 .99      ::::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5261772:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6866291:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6785596:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6190414:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::5816422:4:::6845486:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5347743:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6816341:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families Victorian Living Room Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.03.2011::::    My granddaughter is slowly furnishing   her sylvanian house. She now has the country living room set. Her Sylvanian rabbits can now sit on the sofa and read a magazine. There is an arm chair to match the sofa these are a wooden structure with flowery upholstery. They look quite comfy if you are only a few inches tall. A fireplace which glows comes with this set it needs an AAA battery inserted into the space at the back to make it glow. There are a few logs available if the fire should burn out. Some fire dogs (little shovel and coal tongs) come with this set.There is a small coffee table, a telephone unit with a cupboard underneath. There is a magazine rack. Some accessories come with the furniture a telephone, a clock, some magazines lots of extras to make the living room cosy.Looking at the furniture it really is a time piece looks very similar to my parents furnishing. My parents now dead would be 90 years old. The wooden clock for the mantelpiece is identical to one we had. There are about 35 pieces in this set they are all realistically detailed.This set because of the size of some of the pieces is suitable for those over 4 years old.It is a bit of a tight squeeze to get all these pieces arranged in Beechwood hall my granddaughter   s house. I imagine it would overflow the smaller sylvanian house. My granddaughter plays with this set in her house arranging and rearranging the positions of the furniture. She positions her sylvanian people who then read the books talk on the phone or play with the fire, the naughty sylvanian children get told of for this. A chair and a cup of tea offered to visitors. Through her play I can see exactly what goes on in her real life.I am sure this house could be used for a play therapy session.My granddaughter does use her imagination as the queen came visiting one day another day a fire started.I do not think this will withstand a lot of rough play but with average play will be fine for many years I expect some small pieces might get lost. I expect my granddaughter and I will have many happy hours playing with this .Sorry no photos as yet have not had my camera handy since  this set arrivedThe RRP IS    18..99 but this set can be bought at several shops including http://www.spmodels.co.uk for    17.95      ::::6864647:3:::6864647:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6820455:3:::5439461:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6750576:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5633146:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5261772:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::6840580:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::5347743:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6879236:4:::6879236:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6390014:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6866291:4:::5203100:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5814197:4:::5814197:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families - White Bear Baby::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::12.04.2011::::    Sylvanian Families - White Bear baby with duck carriage toy.Since Christmas my granddaughter aged 5 has acquired many sylvanian accessories to go with Beachwood manor. One is the White baby bear. This cute small baby bear comes in a clear Perspex carry case with a   plastic handle. At the back of the carry case there is a scene setting piece of paper of wallpaper and a window this scene is the same in all the Sylvanian carry cases.Not is there the really cute round baby faced white bear  with a  blue ribbon tied in a bow around its neck ,but there is a little blue carriage  for baby bear to sit in .This carriage has 2 wheels and is attached to the white toy duck which also has 2 wheels . Mummy bear can either push baby on this toy or attach a piece of string to the front and pull baby around to have fun. Baby polar bear also has his bottle of milk and a dummy with him. When baby bear starts to cry (my granddaughter   crying for him) My granddaughter talks to him in her soft voice and gives baby the bottle baby bear sometimes wants to go to bed or have a cuddle sometimes he just cries and cries my granddaughter  hushing him more and more. It   s just like any mummy with a baby really.This toy is suitable for an over 4 year old it has some small pieces. .My granddaughter aged 5 can easily fit the buggy together and position baby in the carriage taking it out at will. My granddaughter usually plays with this bear in conjunction with her other sylvanian family toys. While she is playing she is practicing her motor skills and her imaginary skills, she is reliving real life situations copying parenting situations that she sees. Although my grand daughter   s language skills are good she is practicing them while playing with this toy, copying adult words and behaviour luckily she is copying good parenting skills and language, actually to listen too her playing she is a bit twee sometimes. I looked on line and this toy is available around    4. to    6 at various retailershttp://www.toys2buy.co.uk are selling it for    5.99.    5.65 at http://www.childrenspace.co.ukhttp://www.amazon.co.uk are selling several from    4.58 Postage puts the price up of course so you might be able to get it in a good toy shop or order it with a bulk buy to save postage costs.Would I recommend? Yes as my granddaughter has had a lot of enjoyment from hers. It adds to her play with her other sylvanian toys. Small enough to easily take anywhere and the carrying case is convenient for transporting this toy.  Some of the pieces are so small they might easily get lost . I just trawled through my  photos and discovered this puicture of the baby bear  on my  carpet     ::::5633146:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5790028:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6781956:4:::6145850:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6884550:4:::6884550:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6843584:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6691451:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6866291:4:::5261772:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5362774:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Sylvanian Families Children's Bedroom Furniture Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.03.2011::::    If you have been reading my recent reviews you know my granddaughter has had a lot of the sylvanian family toys for her birthday recently. Sylvanian families were first made by Epoch a Japanese company in 1985.  At one stage they were known as Calico creatures. For a short time they were unavailable in the UK. Flair reintroduced them and they are quite popular. She had Beechwood manor from her parents and we bought some furniture. The bedroom set that we bought was the Children s Bedroom Set  The bedrooms of the sylvanian houses are very small The childrens bedroom set includes more than 18 pieces and I was not sure that all the pieces would fit in but with a bit of juggling and repositioning we were successful.  The bedroom set includes two single beds that can be put on top of each other to make bunk beds. There is a ladder for the bunk beds. Bedding includes 2 each of mattresses, pillows, sheets and blankets, bedspreads. The beds fit together well the legs fitting into the bedposts. Once made the beds look quite cozy. To go on the bed waiting for the Sylvanian children at night are two teddy bears.There is also a storage unit with draws and shelves, looks a bit like a dresser desk. It was a bit of a squeeze getting both the dresser and the bunk beds into the bedroom. The draws of the dresser do open and shut. Some stick on numbers and tiles to put on the dresser come with the set, once on though they do not come off. There are books a bookstop, pencils and other accessories to put in the draws. I hope the Sylvanian s are tidy. To hang on the wall of the bedroom there is a calendar and a couple of pictures.No Sylvanian animal /people come with this set. However my granddaughter also has some Sylvanian  animals.This really is a lovely set   but it only just fits into the bedroom. The accessories really do make  it a    real    bedroom my granddaughter talks as the animals , she has rabbits she gets them to read a book, to do their homework and a mummy rabbit comes into the childrens bedroom  tells them to go to bed and  reads them a story.   The pieces are very small and this set is not suitable for a child under 4, especially if they still mouth things. My granddaughter at 5 I think a good age for it.  I do not think this suitable for a child who is not carefull, although the bed and unit are fairly strong the rabbits lose their tails easily. My granddaughter plays with the Sylvanian house her families and all the furniture she has she is using her real life experiences to create an imaginary world for her toys. While she is playing she is practicing her mothering skills. She is using her fine motor skills, opening shutting the small draws on the bedroom unit. This childrens bedroom set has gone a long way to help make  my granddaughters Sylvanian house a home. My granddaughter has had many happy hours playing with it so far and I anticipate this toy will be played with for several years. This bedroom set can be bought for    10 at http://www.johnlewis.com At Amazon its    11.95. . The R R P is    12.99. Would I recommend ?

       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families Cottage Kitchen Set::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::25.04.2011::::    I played with the Sylvanian families in Beechwood Hall.  Yes I know I am a bit old for playing with the Sylvanian families, but my excuse was I was tidying my granddaughters bedroom for her and a lot of the Sylvanian pieces just needed replacing in the house. I was in the country kitchen This was originally in the Japanese range known as Apple wood kitchen, when it became available in the UK the name changed. I rabbit put the two chairs by the round table there   s not really room for more than 2 chairs. Mummy rabbit put the cups and saucers on the table on the table and then busied herself making a cup of tea     boiling    the kettle  on the 3 ring stove the stove is tiny  looks like a baby belling. I can see there are some burgers cooking on the grill. While boiling the kettle a saucepan and a frying pan were put on the stove ready to cook dinner. While the kettle was boiling mummy rabbit went to the dresser to get the tea canister, what   s that mummy Friesian cow who is visiting likes coffee   that   s ok there   s a canister for coffee too. Ohh isn   t this  a lovely wooden dresser with a couple of shelves two draws and below them two pull out baskets. There a fruit basket and some fruit to put in it too everything is very detailed, very realistic. Now mummy cow insists on washing up the is a bowl and a drainer on the sink unit a hot and cold mixer tap and  plenty of cupboard space underneath with two  doors that open well .  There is also an open cupboard by the side of these I notice mummy rabbit keeps her flour bin there.Although I played with Sylvanian rabbit and cows they are not part of this set only the furniture and kitchen accessories are. In total including the table chairs stove, sink unit and dresser there are 30 pieces in this set an assortment of pots, pans, crockery and cutlery make up the number. There is a sheet of tile stickers so my granddaughter has tiled her sink unit and dresser  These will not restick if removed.This is a fairly well equipped Kitchen. This kitchen is very sweet a traditional kitchen when all the pieces are in place in the Beechwood hall there really is not much roomThis really is an old fashioned country kitchen very traditional. The Sylvanian families are a bit twee, traditional, sweet, old fashioned family girly even though there are male animal figures. The furniture of this kitchen set is well made it   s a little delicate would not withstand a lot of rough play. A child who is not rough will get many years from this set they only have to be a little bit careful.The pieces in this set especially the salt and pepper shaker are very tiny, so this not suitable for a child who still puts things in their mouths.  The company who makes Sylvanian families say they are suitable for over three year olds. I would put it higher as high as 5. My  daughter and I bought Beechwood hall and  a lot of the accessories for my granddaughters Christmas and 5th birthday presents  her birthday is the end of January. It was a bit expensive to buy the house and furniture all together.I do think it is more suitable for a girl really although I am all for equality of the sexes. My granddaughter loves playing with all her sylvanian families they partake in everyday life scenarios. My granddaughter talks in a twee squeaky voice for the animal   s pretending to be daddy rabbit asking the cow if she wants a cup of tea.Your child will have learnt some fine motor skills and spatial awareness before playing with this set and the families the parts are small   to open the draw would be difficult if you could not grip it properly. This set really does inspire imaginative play   the kitchen is the hub of any house and this is no exception my granddaughter makes her sylvanian families sit at the table correctly and eat their food drink there tea. The animals prepare and cook their meals  , do the washing up all with my granddaughters  help of course I  even heard mummy  rabbit and daddy rabbit  telling the rabbit children to do their homework. Ahhh Sylvanian family life, a bit like real life really.The RRP of the Sylvanian country kitchen is    18.99 . You can buy it fromhttp://www.amazon.co.uk price    20. or at http://www.argos.co.uk/   16.29. It is also available at many other toy shops on or off line. Sylvanian families were first made in Japan in 1985 by Epoch,  In  the early 90-   s While they were being distributed by Tomy toys they were known as calico creatures they are now distributed in the UK by Flair. The name Silvan means of the forest   a lot of the animals made are forest creatures. There are families of rabbits cows , badgers , mice, hedgehogs , beavers. These animals do lead human lives though they are clothes and have several houses and vehicles.     ::::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6750576:3:::5633146:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5261772:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6781956:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6758309:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6826738:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6834688:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840580:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6845486:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6817953:4:::6817953:4:::6866291:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families Village Postman Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.01.2011::::    NEW* SYLVANIAN FAMILIES Village Postman Set. This is one of the Sylvanian family sets that I bought my granddaughter for Christmas. I bought this partly because I thought it  was slightly in keeping for a Christmas theme  also because I know  my granddaughter is having a Sylvanian house and  accessories for her birthday that this postman would get some play delivering letters to it . Also I think the Sylvanian families are rather gorgeous and  will have a long play life.We bought the Postman set on line, you can get it for    10.99 at eBay    12,25 at Argos , Amazon is selling for     19.99 the RRP is    15.00 and at  http://www.sylvanian-families.co.uk you can buy the postman set for    12.00. Included in this set is the postman , a letterbox some mail and a bicycle. There is a another set available which includes  a post office and more items  its the Sylvanian Families Post Office and Postman.   *PostmanThe bear postman he is one of the Petite bear family.  Sylvanian families have called this bear Pete   but let your child call him any name they wish, my granddaughter calls her postman George. This bears Arms move from his shoulder and his legs move from his hips so he can sit on the bicycle. The Sylvanian bear is about 5- 6cm tall he is a light tan flock with a lighter nose muzzle. This miniature postman really does look the part dressed in his royal mail blue uniform with red buttons and his matching blue cap. *MailA parcel which looks like it is wrapped in brown paper and a few letters are included in this set. So the postman can cycle to the sylvanian house or shop and deliver the mail.*Mail bag There is a bag which the postman can carry and put the letters in its too small for the parcel though.*PostboxIncluded in the set is a red postbox. The letters can be posted and then collected by the postman as the postbox does open. *BicycleThe postman has also being provided with a bicycle to make his journey delivering mail round Sylvania easier his bicycle is red with a basket on the front so he can carry large mail items. The bicycle has a stand so that it will stand up while the postman is delivering the mail. The grey wheels of the bicycle will turn so that it can be pushed along.*Age suitability, play value. This toy was well received by my granddaughter aged 5 it is suitable for a four year old and over. My granddaughter had some other Sylvanian family animals for Christmas too, she played with the sets together the rabbit   s posted the mail and the postman collected and delivered it back to them. My granddaughter   s birthday is soon and she will be receiving a Sylvanian families house so soon the postman will be delivering mail there. My granddaughter has played with this postman and accessories since, he lives in the Sylvanian caravan with the rabbit family. I have seen him deliver mail in the blue Sylvanian car too. This figure and accessories has enhanced my grand daughter   s imaginary play. This set is one which would interest an older child too and a collector of Sylvanian family toys*Durability.These toys are suitable for gentle play not rough play, the flock does wear and although the creatures can be washed if they get dirty, best not do this too often. The postbox and the bicycle made out of plastic seem to be fairly robust. My Granddaughter is quite gentle and I anticipate that these toys will be a keeper one she will play with for several years then just keep because she loves them.*Sylvanian families The first Sylvanian families were made in Japan in 1985 . In 1987 they were available in the UK I believe they are known as  calico critters  in some other countries. There are many families dormice, rabbits, cows,  bears and  many houses and cars. The web site is http://www.sylvanianfamilies.com where you can see and buy them all.I really think they are adorable, I love playing with my granddaughters  Sylvanian families.     ::::5261772:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5633146:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5414290:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6757811:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6701923:4:::5347743:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6506577:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6840580:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5951201:4:::5951201:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6816341:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5203100:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5335750:4:::6739881:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sylvanian Families Small Bathroom Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::27.02.2011::::    One of the essential rooms to furnish in a new house is the bathroom and we bought the Sylvanian   family a small bathroom for Beechwood hall. My daughter bought the house for her daughter for her birthday and we bought some furniture sets. The small bathroom set comes in small plastic bags inside a card box I hope daughter kept the box for keeping the bath in when granddaughter no longer plays with it.This bathroom is suitable for a child aged 4 years old and older. It is not for a child who still mouths everything due to the small parts. Although Beechwood hall looks a very smart house the room that is most suitable for a bathroom is very small, there are 3 rooms upstairs 2 larger ones have been assigned as bedrooms.  We judged that this small bathroom would fit. The bigger Sylvanian Country Bathroom or the cottage bathroom set too big unless we were to use the second bedroom instead. The nursery bathroom is one suited to the school not Beechwood hall My granddaughter has bought her Sylvanian house here to play with when she visits I have also played with it at her house too, we rearranged the furniture made the bunnies and the cows wash and bathe. (No water was used)No animal figures come with the small bathroom set and there is no toilet either that has to be bought separately. Included in the bathroom set is a roll top bath, a hand basin  unit with a mirror, bathroom scales, a bath tidy and lots of small accessories there the essential bath duck  some soap, a sponge , toothbrush mugs and toothbrushes, toothpaste, a perfume bottle . There   s a bathmat and two towels too. Everything you need, except the toilet. It will be difficult to fit the toilet in when  my granddaughter gets one, still I expect much fun will be had rearranging the furniture and the rooms.All these are well detailed could be miniatures of the real thing.   The taps on the bath and sink are really lovely. They do look a little bit old fashioned styled but then the whole of Sylvania is very traditional and old fashioned that   s part of its charm.This set has play value there   s lots of imaginary play possibilities my granddaughter tells her Sylvanian rabbits to brush their teeth and then helps them, she then tucks them up in bed and reads them a story. I find it fascinating watching her play and listening to her using her funny twee little voice talking for the animals instead of her real voice. Parents could use this as a tool to help them encourage their children to wash and brush their teeth.While playing with this set and the Sylvanian family your child is using their gross and fine motor skills, eye hand coordination and their spatial awareness.The RRP of the small bathroom set is    12.99 Sainsbury   s is selling it on line for 8.99 at http://www.sainsburys.co.uk I expect large   Sainsbury   s have it. Tesco has it for    9.99. The one with free delivery at Amazon costs    13.70 This set looks and feels durable I expect some of the small accessories might get lost..I anticipate playing with my granddaughter and this bathroom in her Sylvanian house for several years before she grows out of it, even then my granddaughter might keep it as the house animals and bathroom are so nice.     ::::5261772:4:::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6800944:4:::6781956:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5347743:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5646482:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6657747:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6741170:4:::6741170:4:::6834688:4:::6857875:4:::6857875:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6843584:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6878499:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840580:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::5439461:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6826738:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::The Bucks Balti House, Aylesbury::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::24.11.2010::::    My husband I arranged to meet up with a friend that we had not seen for ages. We choose to go out for a meal at The Bucks Balti house. This is a curry restaurant in Aylesbury Bucks. The address is 120 the high street. This might be a bit misleading as it is on the road just out of the town centre out of Aylesbury towards London almost opposite the vale park. There are several other Indian restaurants in this area. You can not really park outside the restaurant but there are two multi story car park and another car park with in 10 minutes walking. The Restaurant is quite small seating for about 30 people. You can eat at the restaurant or they have a take out service. If you have a large party it is probably best to book a table by phoning 0871 9610396. We were eating early so did not bother to book. The restaurant is open 5.30 to 11. 30 This restaurant does not sell alcohol so we took some beer and some wine to drink. Since they sell soft drinks they do not let you take your own soft drinks in We were met as we walked through the door by friendly staff we choose our own table very few were taken. The waiter took our coats (it had been raining outside) we could see where they were hung up. The restaurant was not brightly lit and had green leaves strung on the ceiling and walls for d   cor (plastic I think). This looked a fairly respectable restaurant quite clean, not a dive. The atmosphere was friendly. The waiting staff are friendly, not pushy. We were given a menu which had some English explanation to the meals. We had decided we would have a starter and a main course I usually prefer starters to puddings. Starters begin at    2,10 for dhal or soup to    4.80 for a king prawn puri. I had a tandori sheek kebab for    2.60. Main courses start from just over    4 to just over    9. I had a chicken Dopiaza for    4.40 There are side dishes for between    2 and    3 3 course set meals for 2 people are available for between    22 and    26 Sundries are available with a chapatti costing 80p I did not have rice with mine but had a Nan bread costing    1.80. We could have had coffee but choose not to. The three of us had a starter each and a main meal with chapattis, rice or Nan it cost    32. I felt this was a good price. After we had eaten we were not rushed to pay and leave. There were other empty tables anyway. The bill was delivered to our table with a complimentary mint not wafer thin but a chuncky one. Now the taste I thought was good, I could taste individual flavours. the food seemed well cooked, husband said his although not bad could have been better. Our friend was happy with his meal. Yes I would be happy to eat at The Bucks Balti again.

       " '5247778::::La Riviere  Porte Puymorens, Porte Puymorens::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::23.10.2010::::    This summer we went on a camping holiday to France and Andorra. In France we stayed a couple of nights at the campsite La Riviere in Porte Puymorens.  Porte Puymorens is in the Pyr   n   es-Orientales it   s only a few kilometres to Andorra and Spain. This small Catalan village of Porte Puymorens has some skiing although the major ski resort is in Andorra just a few kilometres over the mountains. We were not there for the skiing but for the wildlife.  We had noted the location of this campsite on line before we left England as a possible stop. There is limited information at the website http://www.gralon.net or http://www.camping-enfrance.com. From this we got an idea of where it was and that it was a small campsite that was enough in for us for our 2 night stop. We arrived in Porte Puymorens and our campsite was on a turning towards the river. At The entrance was a building containing the campsite offices . A sign announced it was camping municipal. La Riviere. We arrived at a time that there was no one at the office so we did a little tour of the campsite and decided it was ok. The position was good in the valley with a backdrop of the mountains.As no one was obvious we proceeded to erect our tent in what we considered to be a good position. After we had our tent up and we had made ourselves at home I went to the office and found someone there. In August we paid 4 euros per night for our 2 man tent plus 2 euros per person. There was no charge for the car so for 8 euros we were set up for a night. The person in the office seemed pleasant enough.This was a fairly small campsite the web site says 60 places this includes some static caravans and I suspect the yurt that was opposite us was also static. The spaces allocated for each tent seemed sufficient, There was shade from trees which were planted around the site. Although we did not need /want one there were electrical hook ups available. The site was fairly flat grassy The rocky terrain under the grass did make it difficult to put some of the tent pegs in. Accees around the site was by a narrow road.. The sanitation block had a tap for drinking water and there was quite a large communal space with sinks for washing, I did not notice any laundry facilities other than hand wash. The male and female toilets were at opposite sides of the building only a few cubicles in each and a small number of wash basins. There were a couple of showers too  The  cleanliness   off this area was not all that good really my husband said the men   s was quite dirty the ladies I think a little better but I felt it needed  some updating. I did see someone cleaning them it was the same person who was at the office There was a disabled shower and toilet room which as no one was using when I visited this area I preferred to use. This room was fine a toilet with hand rail on one side and a shower on the other. This shower would have been accessible for disabled people as there was no shower tray rim.  The shower was good a good force and temperature. There was also a hand basin with a mirror. Although I do not use a wheel chair I have some experience of pushing them and think the space in this room sufficient.   Pets are allowed on site I noticed a couple of dogs. This site was fairly quiet most of the time except that the guy who was inhabiting the yurt had some friends visit him in the evening  they stayed there when we wanted to be asleep they were talking and laughing till the early hours must have been about 3 am before they left. I did not notice any swings or climbing frames for children , but there was a football pitch in the field which the site overlooked and I notices some people from the site using it , not sure if it belonged to the campsite or not. Near by there is horse riding and fishing as well as the mountains. I did not see a shop on site selling food luckily we had bought provisions with us. The nearest shop was a very small one in Porte Puymorens that sold the basics I do not think there was another shop for miles. There are a few hotels with restaurants in Puymorens but we did not need them. This campsite is in a great position with lovely walks without needing to go too drive its an ideal position for touring  this area of France and its so near the Spanish border and the Andorra one too however getting into Andorra might take ages with all the traffic from France queuing up at customs. I did get my feet wet. We experienced a storm with a lot of rain while we were here this is not uncommon in the mountains in August.  The site coped well with the amount of rain we had.  This campsite is fine if you do not expect many facilities just a place to rest your head. I would be happy to stay here for one or two nights again but not for a full week      ::::5439461:3:::5646482:3:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6781956:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6840580:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5261772:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5414290:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5817619:4:::5817619:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6657747:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6843584:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6816341:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6805476:5:::6805476:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Melissa And Doug Shape Sorting Clock::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::14.03.2011::::    Tick tock, tick tock its time to make the Melissa and Doug Shape clock. This shape sorter puzzle clock is one I have at work. It is suitable for over threes. Depending on abilities I think a 5 -6 or 7 year old would still get some use from it.This clock is made from wood. It is durable will last a long time, suitable for home or early years provision. Ours is in a classroom and gets quite a bit of use. The hands still go round easily and it looks in good condition the paint not chipped.The clock shape sorter is a good size 9    in diameter and 2        thick.It is really attractive to a child as the wood has been painted bright but not garish colours.   The inner of the clock has coloured markers every 5 minutes  the quarter past , half past quarter too and o clock is marked on The hands of the clock which   are easy to move are different colours one red one blue, the longer red hand has the word minute written on it the shorter blue one hours. These hands are not too loose and will stay in the position they are put.The numbers are written around the inner circumference of the clock this will help your child place the shaped number pieces in the correct place. The clock face is a realistic analogue face. I prefer this type of face clock for learning to tell the time ,although I am sure there are households which only have digital display clocks.Around the outer circumference of the clock 12 shaped holes have been cut out. To go into these holes are 12 shaped pieces these are all a different shape and colour. Each one has a number painted on it. These pieces are not too difficult for a 3 year old to position. This clock is a good learning aid. A younger child not able to tell the time will use it as a shape sorter learning the different shapes and colours. Do remember to talk to your child while he/she is playing with this tell them the names of the shapes and colours soon they will know them. Your child will be practicing their eye hand coordination and spatial awareness.The numbered pieces are also useful for teaching number and countingAs your child matures   this can be used as an aid to tell the time start at the o clocks repetition will help your child learn.There is a card that comes with this toy it has several ideas for activities and games.    We get lots of sticky fingers on this clock it   s easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth. This is a good clock the R R P IS    9.99.   I looked on line and many toy shops are selling for around the    9 or    10 pound mark. Amazon has it for    9.98Yes I defiantly would recommend this toy. Melissa and Doug are a good maker of toys, educational and durable.       ::::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6750576:3:::5633146:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6875788:4:::6875788:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6845153:4:::6800944:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5203100:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6145850:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6880805:4:::6691451:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::5362774:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6735325:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6292077:4:::6869878:4:::6869878:4:::6844462:4:::6845486:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5347743:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Assorted Pens::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::16.02.2011::::    Tesco Value Assorted Pens 10 PackI bought a pack of ten ball point pens from Tesco   s recently for 28p. This was a pack of mixed coloured pens 4 blue 3 black and 3 red. These pens are a standard ball pen size 16 cm long about     cm diameter.The pens have a cap for the nib which is the same colour as the ink and a clear barrel at the end of the barrel is a matching coloured twist cap twist it off and the ink stem is easy to remove. These pens have 6 flat sides this stops them rolling off the desk easily it also does make them easier to hold than a circular barrel pen.  The ball point nib is a medium one giving a good mark.The colours these inks give is fine a good red a good blue and black nothing wrong with the colours. I think it   s a good mix as I will use a blue pen most.Durability?  Well I can not tell you how long they will write for but the length of the ink stem is the same as other ball point pens.As with other ballpoint pens the plastic barrel will break if stood on hard. I have written with these pens before and they are fine. I think they are ideal for the school pencil case, or for writing that shopping list. At under 3p each cheap enough not to worry if they get lost, borrowed and not returned.     ::::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6873980:3:::6873980:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6320122:3:::6320122:3:::6818102:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::6786123:3:::6786123:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6786865:4:::6506577:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6378497:4:::6378497:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6816341:4:::6826738:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6817953:4:::6817953:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pig In The Pond - Martin Waddell::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::30.03.2011::::    This term we have been reading    The pig in the pond    by Martin Waddell illustrations by Jill Barton. This book was originally published by Walker Books in 1992. The pig is in the pond is available in several book sizes including the big book Size: 376 x 455 mm. This sized book is the one we read in class to the children. The story is about Neligan   s pig. Neligan is a farmer and one day he goes into town leaving his pig by the pond.It was hot it was dry, the duck and the goose swam on the pond. As time goes by the pig gets hotter and hotter the duck and the goose invite her in, but the pig retorts    pigs don   t swim    The tale goes on about how hot it is we see the pig getting hotter and hotter but still we read the words but pigs don   t swim . Eventually after the pig stamps her trotters    . yes you have guessed it the pig  jumps into the pond with a huge splash. Word goes round the farmyard    The pig is in the pond    each animal tells the next    the pigs in the pond    then goes to the pond to look. Each animal makes its own animal sound moo, baa, honk and so on so we have sheep cow, hen, dog and cat watching in amazement at the pig in the pond. Then Neligan returns Neligan looks at the situation then tales his clothes of and jumps in the pond with the pig. The other farmyard animals then follow him in.This book is a fun read for beginning readers or as a read aloud book it has 30 pages with a couple of sentences on each. The story is rhythmic the words fun and tell a good tale a silly story that children like. Certain phrases are repeated like    pigs don   t swim and    the pig is in the pond    as the story is read the children repeat the words with me. The pictures really make the book they are watercolour and pencil the images of the animals expressive the pig certainly looks hot and bothered.This story certainly provoked lots of talking about the weather and swimming we talked about the animals and about which animals can swim. We talked about the animals and the sounds they make there was a lot of baaa ing woofing and quacking going on in class. We also talked about feeling hot and what we would do.To help illustrate this book to children  have some props ready a  toy farmer , doll. a toy pig and  the other animals. I had a bowl of water handy too.My children enjoyed listening to this story enjoying the repatition  and the suspence and anticipation of knowing that eventually the pig would jump inYes I would recommend this book to read to your child at home or   for a nursery or early years class.     ::::6820455:2:::5633146:3:::5764692:3:::5764692:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6750576:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5439461:3:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6880805:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5470165:4:::5470165:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6145850:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6723034:4:::6654507:4:::5255134:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6190414:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6866291:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6830048:4:::6816341:4:::5347743:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Ground Cumin::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.04.2011::::    I buy my ground Cumim in Tesco. Cumin Cuminum cyminum, is a member of the parsley family. The seeds are used for flavouring. Cumin is a herb grown in eastern at Mediterranean climates not easy to grow in the UK.Cumin is packaged by Tesco in two forms   ground or whole seeds. I have the ground variety it comes in the same style glass jar as other spices and herbs. Tesco just recently has changed the style of their jars a little. The jars are still that square base shape but now also have a  square  black flip up lid instead of a round one There are 43g of cumin in a jar. It has a black cap with a pouring hole. Open the lid it smells like a sweet curry slightly peppery. The cumin is ground into very small powdery grains it is damp sand coloured.I like making home made curries and will often use cumin as one of the herbs. It adds a warm almost nutty flavour to foods.  The taste is not especially fiery. add ground cumin to chicken and lamb dishes. Adds a spicy touch to potatoes too .I will make a paste of cumin, chilli, oregano, olive oil and pepper and cover the chicken or lamb with it and grill or bake. There are many on line recipes using ground cumin http://allrecipes.com//Recipes/herbs-and-spices/spices/cumin/Main.aspx has lots. There are also some great recipes at http://www.cuminrecipes.blogspot. Cumin certainly adds an authentic curry flavour to dishes. You do not need a lot just     to 1 teaspoon for most dishes. Tesco does warn that it might include nuts and sesame seeds due to the factory it is produced in.At 40p for 43g Tesco ground Cumin is much cheaper than Swartz Cumin which is 1.41 p for 28g.Writing this review and tidying up my herb store has inspired me I shall read those recipe pages and use some of my ground cumin from Tesco in a new recipe.      ::::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5790028:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6145850:3:::6820455:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6829585:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::5439461:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::3957:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6691451:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6864207:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6884301:4:::6884301:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6816341:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6830048:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Whole Cloves::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::03.04.2011::::    Tesco cloves I was rummaging in my spice cupboard again and found some Tesco cloves.These cloves come in the standard Tesco herb/spice glass jars containing 35g. There is a black flip top lid with a hole big enough to pour a couple of cloves out at a time.Opening the lid I get a waft of the strong spicy aroma. The individual cloves are quite attractive they look like a red brown stud.These cloves taste strong too. I have tasted pure cloves   buy not liked the flavourCloves are aromatic dried buds of an evergreen tree which grows in tropical climate. They are picked then sun dried and become a dark red brown.I have string child hood memories of mum pushing some into an apple before baking cookingI have also made a pomander by pushing lots of cloves into the skin. of an orange When I have inserted lots of cloves .When completed for added aroma roll the orange through cinnamon and nutmeg. Then choose a ribbon and 75 -80cm long. Start by putting the middle of the ribbon at the top of the orange take both ends either side of the orange to the bottom. Cross the ribbons over, and take the pieces back up to top then tie in a bow. Dry then either hung up or in an airing cupboard.These make great Christmas gifts for children to give. The look and smell good as a decision on the chrisms tree, lemons work well too.I have made these several times and Tesco cloves would be ideal to use for these.There are many apple recipes using cloves but also they will add an extra spicy flavour to gammon if a few are inserted into the skin Cloves are also one of the ingredients of mulled wine making  that lovely spicy flavour there are many on line recipies of mulled wine just search.Although I have not used them for toothache apparently if you have bad toothache  just place a couple of cloves by the offending tooth and the pain will ease. So Tesco cloves would be easy to get and use for this.Talking of teeth do remember to take them out  before eating and breaking a tooth on it..Tesco whole cloves cost 65p  for the 35g jar At ASDA a 31g jar will cost   58p I think that   s a fair price                      ::::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6750576:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6829585:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::6820455:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5954627:4:::5954627:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6826738:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6758309:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6779453:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5439461:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Table Salt::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::28.03.2011::::    I was filling up my salt cellar so decided I would write a salty review. I do not like seeing a huge plastic milk bottle like container of salt on my table, I decant my salt into a small salt shaker cellar that matches my pepper one. The750gsalt container from Tesco that I have is plastic it is cylindrical it is white and has blue words and a blue picture of a plate and a knife and fork on it. The cap is blue tooThe cap has 2 small flip up lids about 1cm square one revealing a square hole for pouring the salt out of the other revealing 6 small holes more suitable for shaking salt out of slowly although beware the salt does not sprinkle out of these holes too slowly and you might swamp your chips in salt. The salt in this shaker has an anti caking agent added so I have never known it clog the holes it runs freely. This salt needs to be kept in a cool dry place to ensure its free running. Although I prefer to have the salt that I use on the table in a nicer smaller salt cellar I have known people use this direct on the table. I do use mine for adding to foods while I am cooking .I tend not to add much salt to food while cooking but something s do require a little to bring out and enhance the flavour. I do use this Tesco salt mostly for adding to food. I have been known to use it to make play dough with but I usually use the larger 1kg value bag I use this Tesco table salt to make a gargle for when I have a sore throat, good to use if you get an ulcer too. Table salt can be used successfully for cleaning too I can remember mother using salt for several cleaning tasks it was frequently used in Victorian times. Mum would make a paste of it to clean brass and copper. Salt is useful for cleaning lots of dirt and grime especially fresh red wine. http://www.lowsalt.info/serv03.htm has 101 uses for salt Salt is fairly cheap and you do not use much at a time. It is recommended that you do not consume more than 6g a day. Prepared foods often contain a lot of salt so you can cut down by not sprinkling so much on foods. Tesco table salt is only 21p reduced from 27p for a plastic bottle shaped shaker/pourer 750g container of Tesco table salt Saxa salt in a similar container cost 41p. I have previously reviewed Tesco value salt which is presented in a 1kg bag. Unless you really need a lot of salt or have a decent storage jar I would recommend this over the cheaper1kg value salt I talked about a few days ago. This 750g in the tub is much easier to store and pour. Yes I would recommend this salt its container is fine and the salt tastes like many other.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6723034:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6874894:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6805327:4:::6805327:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6691451:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6866291:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Trains 2735 Curved Rails::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::27.03.2011::::    I do have fun at work, last week I was playing trains with some 5 year olds. We were using the Lego Duplo train set we made straight track lines for the trains to run on and a circle too. The curved rail that we used to make our circle of train track was from this 2735 set which has 6 pieces of curved rail in it. In fact we needed two of these packs to make a complete circle as it takes 12 pieces of Duplo curved rail track to make a circle58cm in diameter. Duplo curved rails are suitable for a child aged about 2 years old up to 5 or 6 depending on your child   s abilities . Once you have the rails you will of course need trains to run on them.These curved rail pieces are grey coloured each piece is interlocking with either a male or female joining part at each end. Although you will need to assist your 18 month to about 26month old to position and fit these correctly once your child has been shown and practices a few times they  will find them easy to fit.Your child will be practicing their fine motor skills and reasoning skills fitting these together and working out which end fits in. I was using these at work to enhance our work on circles however you do not need to just make a complete circle these pieces can make the Duplo train set turn corners it does make that straight lay out more interesting.I think these are suitable for taking out with a board or onto the flat patio stones to play with in the summerThese train track pieces are made of a good strong plastic that will last for many play hours, many years. It is easy to wash and disinfect should they get dirty.  I have known children play with these circle pieces and Duplo trains happily for many hours.Yes I would recommend them whole heartedly.     ::::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6750576:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6882636:3:::6882636:3:::5347743:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6866291:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6845153:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6691451:4:::5722409:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6779453:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6781956:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Soya Too Whipped Cream In A Can::::Food & Drink::::20::::very helpful::::24.03.2011::::    When my grandchildren visit I do not like to think my dairy intolerant grandson misses out on treats like ice cream and cream if the rest of the family are eating them. I regularly buy Swedish glace dairy free ice cream both from the health shop and Tesco s. At Christmas I bought us dairy cream and went into my local heath shop and saw Soy too soy whip squirt cream in a can. It was    2.40 for a 250g tin, a little expensive really, but I though we would all eat it not just grandson. Soytoo also make a can containing squirty rice cream my health store only had the Soya cream. Christmas day was the first time we used this cream. I removed the cap gave the tin a shake then depressed the squirty nozzle and it squirted out. I was please with the result it came out light and airy the texture good like any squirty cream really. The taste was very good, not buttery like some good dairy creams but a very good creamy flavour I have heard some say it s a bit beany flavoured. Successful I gave it to my 8 year old grandson who easily depressed the nozzle and the cream squirted out to his delight he had great fun. I told grandson to stop when I thought he had enough cream on his pudding. Luckily I had some dairy cream in the fridge as after my son in law had some the cream stopped squirting ...... no more would come out of the tin no amount of shaking, turning the tin upside down would make more cream come out of the can. I am sure the can was not empty. When I looked on line just now I find other people also had this problem with the can. Shame as it will put me off buying more another time I may buy the rice one to try but it worked out too expensive for the quantity the can allowed us to squirt out. The ingredients of this cream are Organic soymilk (water, soybeans), organic coconut oil, organic fractionated palm kernel oil, organic sugar beet syrup, organic maltodextrin, tartaric acid, carrageenan, sea salt, natural vanilla extract, propellant (nitrous oxide). It is Gluten and dairy free I disposed of the can so I can not look to find the calories on line it says 643 kJ / 155 kcal fat 11 g I think that s per 100g Would I recommend? Yes if the can propelled all the cream and it did not stop after a few squirts.      ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6843355:4:::6750576:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6845153:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6701923:4:::6800944:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5790028:4:::6609678:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5203100:4:::6866291:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6716869:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil Dragon Warrior::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.03.2011::::    I believe this dragon warrior only joined the troops last year. I bought one at Christmas to join the other dragon warriors to defend a castle where I often play (alongside some children of course) This dragon warrior at only 7.5 cm tall fearlessly joins the other dragon knights. The helmet he wears is black with some red markings it has horns on top to make him look fearsome. Removing the helmet he reveals his smiling face with those two dot Playmobil eyes. This warriors arm will move up and down not bending though.His red clawed hand easily holds the axe or sword in fact he can hold one in each hand to fend of the enemy.The warrior stands in black boots with red trousers the uniform of the Dragon knights. He will stand to attention or bend at the waist his legs move together, his body will turn.A yellow gold belt is around the black jerkin that he wears over his red shirt.  Yes this warrior certainly looks the part. This Playmobil dragon warrior is suitable for a 4 year old and over my grandson aged 7 still plays with his Playmobil castle and knights. Playmobil is still suitable for children up to the age of around 10 depending on the individual child of course. This warrior costs from    2.50 at Amazon. The price at http://www.playmobildirect.co.uk   2.49 I found it several places on line for around    2.50.Playmobil figures are durable I would expect this one top last well too.I would recommend the warrior for a child who likes playmobil and knights and dragons. It is a good addition to the other playmobil dragon, castles and knights will give more opportunity for imaginary play, for setting the scene at the castle.       ::::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::6864647:3:::6864647:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::5347743:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6495932:4:::6691451:4:::5203100:4:::3957:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6880805:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6853095:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6866291:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830048:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Table Salt::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.03.2011::::    I just made some play dough (recipe at end of review) and used some Tesco table salt. This was not the one in a plastic tub but one in a clear plastic bag. This is a value product and has Tesco red writing on it with the blue stripes.This salt costs 23p for 1 kg. To open this bag I cut the corner with a pair of scissors I did not use it all so sealed it with a wire twist.  Then I put the bag inside a plastic tub I did not want salt spilling in my cupboard. This salt is much like other table salts it is white and grainy.It contains an anticaking substance so that it will pour easily I have never had any caking problems with  Tesco salt . but I remember someone who had a damp storage cupboard keeping a few grains of uncooked rice in the salt cellar.While I had this out I refilled the salt shaker on my table. This salt is ideal for any recipe that needs salt.*PreservingThis salt would have been fine for my mum to use when she salted beans to preserve them. In the days before freezers were common salt was used a lot to preserve foods. Going back to the late 50   s early 6o    s  to preserve a glut of beans my mum used to  slice fresh runner beans and put them in a jar which she would then fill with salt water (brine). This would then keep the beans so she could use them in the winter months when there were few fresh vegetables. This method would be called pickling. Going back to those days there were fewer supermarkets and less fresh vegetables available imported from other countries.However I will not be preserving beans like this.*Removing stainsTesco table salt or any other table salt can be used for helping clean those disastrous spillages of red wine. I have in fact used it for this unless cleaned quickly red wine will stain. I had a glass of red wine that was spilt on to my oatmeal carpet and I ran around  clucking   in despair like a headless chicken, oh no what do I do. I then remembered that salt is an old remedy. I dashed to the kitchen and got some salt .I then sprinkled it liberally over the wine. I then  looked on the internet to see the recommended procedure Apparently you leave the salt on the wine stain for 15 minutes then clean with a mixture of 1/3 cup vinegar to 2/cup water. I went back to my carpet and the salt had absorbed some wine as it had gone pink. I got my vinegar and water and cleaned and scrubbed. This method was sucesful I just looked on the internet and found a site for   uses of salt in cleaning. Some look handy so will try and remember some and use the website http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/home/uses-for-salt-cleaning-your-house-ga.htm has lots of good tips.*Gargling Another way I have used to salt is as a gargle. I often get sore throats and was recommended by a doctor to gargle with salt. See http://blog.beliefnet.com/freshliving/2009/04/why-salt-water-gargling-helps-your-throat.html For why, I also know that it is   recommended sometimes for tooth ache that is caused by infection  see http://www.buzzle.com/articles/sore-tooth-remedy-recipe-for-salt-water-gargle.html for info.*Recipe for play dough1 cup of plain flour    half a cup of salt    1 cup of water    1 tablespoon cooking oil    2 teaspoons cream of tartar    Food colouring or scents as desired*Method. Mix all ingredients well and stir over a medium heat. When it becomes a thick soft dough remove from heat and knead it when it is cool *AlternativelyPlace all the ingredients in a microwave container and cook for one and a half minutes in a microwave. Stir the mixture and then microwave again for one minute*Back to Tesco table salt. This is a refined salt chemical name sodium chloride  It tastes like other salts .I sprinkle some onto my chips. Salt is important in the diet but do not eat in excess or it can do harm The Government   s Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) for salt is 6g. Do remember though a lot of prepared foods already contain lots of salt.*PriceA 1 kg bag of Tesco   s salt costs 23p for 1 kg.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Porridge Oats::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::17.03.2011::::    Q) Why have I got a pack of Tesco value oats in my food cupboard when I do not really like porridge?A) It   s because I use them for baking. I use them in flapjacks and add them to fruit crumble mixes.*Price These oats cost 75p for a 1 kg bag ,  Tesco Scottish porridge oats cost 99p per 1 kg bag Quaker oats cost    1.58 for a 1 kg box. There are several other brands of porridge oats available too at a variety of prices.*Packaging   The oats are in a simple clear plastic bag. This has the standard Tesco value labeling blue and red.I open my packet with a pair of scissors and decant into a storage jar otherwise I tend to get oats all over my cupboard.*Allergy advice May have nuts and sesame seeds due to the factory where it   s packaged   using those products.

Oats are good as they fill you up and release energy slowly.SmellOpening the bag I sniff, it   s a dry smell not unpleasant not outstandingly yummy really words fail me it   s a cereal smell oaty. looks Small light brown rough flakes*TextureI sometimes use these oats for sensory play with special needs children. The texture is rough and fibrous when not cooked, its softer yet fibrous when cooked.*Use Oats are use in many dishes as well as for porridge. I have made flapjacks and other biscuits using Tesco value oats. They are ideal for coating fish. There are many recipe   s at http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/oatsI think these oats work as well as other oats that I have used.As I mentioned earlier I use these for sensory play with special needs children.  Allowing children to play with dry or wet oats allows children to explore the properties through touch. Oats are good as it does not matter if the child eats them. Adding oats to playdough   (flour, water, salt home made recipes are on line)   makes a god textured playdough to explore.*Taste Unlike some of my students I have not tasted uncooked oats. The taste can not be that fantastic as after a few fistfuls of them my students do not eat many, unlike when we use custard or other cereals like rice crispies or cornflakes.As I said I do not like porridge but I like the oaty flavour that these oats add to biscuits and my crumble it   s a wholesome flavour.*RecommendationYes I would recommend these for baking and sensory pla     ::::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5624457:3:::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5439461:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6874193:4:::6874193:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6876907:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6875788:4:::6875788:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6845153:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5719918:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::6824315:4:::6824315:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6752066:4:::6752066:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6866291:4:::6609678:4:::6879769:4:::6879769:4:::5203100:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6691451:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6735325:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::5362774:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840580:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Sainsbury   s has the same price and offer. Each pack has 2 steaks in it.Quorn is suitable for vegetarians made from mycoprotein (fungi) it is low in fat, high in protein.Each steak weighs 98g and has 107 kcal.  They are a decent size for a meal. They are presented on a plastic tray in a card sleeve.These steaks are shaped a bit like a teardrop and are coated in a green and red pepper and cracked black peppercorns. They  look a brown colour.Allergy suffers need to be aware that they contain  Barley Malt Extract, Gluten, Wheat,  Eggs, Milk and may contain Nuts.I put 2 packets of my 3 in the freezer and cooked 2 of the steaks under the grill they took 12 minutes will take a bit longer if cooked from frozen. These Quorn steaks can be microwaved or cooked in the oven they are fine on the barbeque, so a good option for veggie friends. These are good just served with chips and a veg or even just in a large roll or baguette with some salad. Or  they could be served with boiled or roast potatoes and vegetables.~Taste.The flavour is quite spicy, it   s peppery but not hot. I personally am not over keen on peppers but I liked these a lot and will willingly eat more.~TextureWhen cooked the outer coating slightly crisp the centre moist and soft they are quite succulent.

       " '5247778::::Ryelands Plain Chocolate Bar::::Food & Drink::::10::::very helpful::::13.03.2011::::    Ryelands  plain chocolate.  I could not see any of the Tesco value plain chocolate  that I liked on the shelf, So bought the Ryelands chocolate for 89p  2 FOR    1.70 at the moment.This chocolate comes in a 200g bar so it is cheap at 44.2p per 100g. This plain chocolate is wrapped in red like many other plain chocolate bars. The wrapper a plastic foil .A picture on the front of a few chucks of chocolate on a white oval background.Nutrition info is on the back of the pack giving the calorific values of 530 kcal in 100g, 155 kcal in 4 squares. Also Allergy advice saying it contains Soya may contain milk it may also contain nuts due to machinery usage.I tore open the pack and broke a couple of the dark brown chocolate chunks off, each chunk about 2.1/2 cm no markings on the chocolate. I smelt it, it did smell like chocolate. I eagerly popped a chunk by 2 cm. This is quite a hard chocolate took a time to melt in my mouth.The taste like poor quality cooking chocolate bitter, sour it is an unpleasant taste I did not like so will not be buying again, I was disappointed because I love dark chocolate.There are 530 kcal in 100g that   s 155 kcal in 4 squares. I looked at the use by date that   s not till 01 2013. I suspect I will not be using this chocolate by then it will remain in my cupboard or thrown away.Perhaps I will use it at school. Chocolate is good to show children changes I could microwave it show them its liquid stir in some cheap cornflakes and they will see the chocolate harden when it gets cold. There that   s a foundation stage science lesson.I looked up Ryelands found limited info but I think it   s a Tesco own brand as none of the other main supermarkets sell it and the packaging has info printed on that its produced in France for Tesco stores.     ::::6766749:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6829585:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5879281:4:::5879281:4:::6880805:4:::6735325:4:::6609678:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6845153:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6866291:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5790028:4:::5203100:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5814197:4:::5814197:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6874894:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5347743:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galaxy Orange And Shortcake Chocolate Bar::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::12.03.2011::::     I had a small chocolate hamper for Christmas from my beloved and in it he put a 120g Galaxy orange and shortcake chocolate bar. I looked at Sainsbury   s on line and find you can buy 1 bar for    1.39 or 2 for    2.00 until March.Galaxy chocolate is a smooth dairy chocolate and has pieces of orange and shortcake biscuit scattered in it.  This bar contains 90  milk chocolate, with 5  orange pieces and 5  shortcake. I opened then orange coloured paper wrapping then the silver foil.The chocolate bar is divided into 30 small rectangles (6 rows of 5) each one has a curvy design on it. I smelt the chocolate before I tasted it, there was a very light hint of orange when I put the chocolate right up to my nose it did smell mostly of chocolate.The first bite or two I could not discern the orange flavour, the chocolate as you would expect from Galaxy was a good taste. After a couple of more bites I found a few small pieces of shortbread this gave a  slight crunch to the bite, then I got a few chewy pieces of orange very small and these gave me a light  orange flavour. I was expecting a stronger orange flavour from this chocolate, the flavour was very delicate. I was a little disappointed as I had expected a stronger flavour of orange. The orange flavour no where near as prominent as in a Terry   s chocolate orange. However this was a pleasant bar of chocolate the Galaxy taste good and the added crunch of the biscuit pieces and the lightly flavoured chewy orange.There are 653 calories per bar 22cal per rectangle piece.  My opinion well this bar is nice but not that special to me, I would not bother to buy one for myself, I would choose an alternate chocolate bar.      ::::5633146:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6320122:3:::6320122:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5439461:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::6846862:3:::6846862:3:::6654280:3:::6654280:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6874894:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6766749:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6609678:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6292077:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6866291:4:::6880805:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5814197:4:::5814197:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6840580:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Dried Marjoram::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.03.2011::::     Inspired by sorting out my herb and spice rack this week I am writing my review on Tesco dried marjoram.Marjoram and oregano are related herbs both members of the Lamiaceae family, the mint family. The two herbs are often confused and interchanged. Marjoram is sweeter and milder than oregano. I usually use oregano in spaghetti dishes but marjoram sometimes there is not a great deal of difference in the flavour.Tesco   s dried marjoram comes in a square flat sided jar containing 10g costs    1.16   cheaper than named labels of dried herbs and spices.This jar fits nicely on my spice /herb rack spice jars seem to be a standard size. This jar has a black flip top lid which opens to reveal a pouring hole.Opening the lid I smell the sweet herb reminds me of   herby grassy hillsides. I pour a few of the finely chopped dried leaves onto my hand they are small green specks.I use marjoram in many recipes it goes well with tomato pasta Italian meals and is lovely   added to chicken dishes.  Barbequed chicken is fantastic when the skin has been rubbed with garlic and marjoram.I used some Tesco dried marjoram to make a simple tomato pasta dish recently I cooked some pasta and added some cherry tomatoes some garlic and some dried marjoram which I had saut   ed in some olive oil. Rule of thumb says dried herbs are about double the strength of fresh ones. The longer dried herbs are stored the less strong they are. Marjoram and oregano are related herbs both members of the Lamiaceae family, the mint family. Marjoram is sweeter and milder than oregano. I usually use oregano in spaghetti dished but marjoram sometimes there is not a great deal of difference in the flavourThe BBC site http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/search?keywords=marjoram has lots of good recipes using marjoram. Tesco dried marjoram is as good as any other dried marjoram that I have used, so no need for a posher brand.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6874894:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6657747:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6843355:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6880805:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::6609678:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6840580:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Schwartz Cinnamon Sticks::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::10.03.2011::::    Shwartz cinnamon sticks ciaoBear with me while I continue sorting my herb and spice cupboard out. The next item is a Jar of Schwartz cinnamon stick   s. These are left over from Christmas I bought them to make some mulled wine.  Schwartz cinnamon sticks are in a glass jar, the jar like other Schwartz herb jars a cylinder with a ridge bottom and top for easy gripping. This design looks attractive, the twist lid orange. This cinnamon spice jar fits well on my standard spice/herb rackI only have 1 cinnamon stick left but I think there were 5. These sticks measure about 6 or 7 cm long Opening the jar it smells good that lovely woody spicy smell.These cinnamon sticks are ideal for making an infusion, for spicing up mulled wine or for adding flavour to apple juice cinnamon cider is goodI wanted some ground cinnamon but did not have any so pounded a cinnamon stick with my pestle and mortar made 2 teaspoons full of ground cinnamon from one stick. Another use of cinnamon sticks is for adding smell to your decoration and presentation. A bundle of these tied with a red ribbon looks good on table or on Christmas tree, add a dried orange or apple slice to make it really nice.I have seen candles with cinnamon sticks stuck around themSchwartz cinnamon sticks are good however I do not think they taste different from the ones packages as Tesco own which I have had before. However Schwartz is a good reliable range and usually the one stocked in small shops as well as supermarkets A Jar of these Schwartz cinnamon sticks will cost    1.48 for 13g that   s    11.38 / 100gCinnamon sticks are made from thin rolls of the inner bark of the cinnamon tree. Apparently cinnamon was used by Egyptians in embalming. Would I recommend? Yes because my mulled wine infused with these was good,There are many recipes for mulled wine on line I can not remember which I used. Mulled wine uses red wine cinnamon sticks, orange and lemon peel, vanilla pods, honey, ginger. Smells and depending on the recipe can taste good, but I have had some pretty dire mulled wine in my time too.     ::::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5335750:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6831875:4:::6831875:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6735325:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6657747:4:::6781956:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5362774:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6840580:4:::6469822:4:::6469822:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6866291:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Gelert Money Belt::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::09.03.2011::::    A few years ago my mothering law gave me her Gelert money belt as she no longer needed it and we were going on holiday. I have had several money belts before excellent way of carrying cash at a festival or on holiday its great when camping.  This belt has been with me to Glastonbury and to Spain, to France, Turkey to Tunisia and many other places too.This Gelert money belt is fabric it is soft rip stop polyester cotton a light tan sand colour, the pale colour is good as it does not show much under light coloured clothing. Unlike some other money belts/bags that I have had before this is a flat one so not as bulky. I find this very useful as I can wear this belt under a jumper and I do not get an unsightly bulge that looks like I have a growth on my waist. Unless I overstuff it this money belt is quite discreet. I do not find this belt uncomfortable to wear it is not heavy.This has an elasticised waist belt that is adjustable this is attached to the zipped pockets.  The zipped [pockets are not detachable from the belt. I think the length would be suitable for both women and slim men. There are two zipped pockets to this belt, the zips are nylon zips. The zips go the complete length of the pockets so no gaps for pennies or cents to roll out of. The biggest pocket is about 26-27 cm long and about 12 -13 cm deep. The smaller is about 20--21 cm wide and 10-11 cm deep. There is enough room in the largest pocket for a passport or to squeeze a cheque book into, cheque book gets a bit curled up though. I put money notes into it too. I have carried my mobile phone in the top pocket too. My camera is too big/fat to go in .A piece of paper with our map/walking route photocopied on to it and a few emergency phone numbers goes in when we are walking The smaller pocket is ideal for a few loose coins. Money notes fit in well as does cheque/visa card. I usually put that in the large pocket though. The small pocket is ideal for tickets.  So that is about all that will stuff into this money belt at one time.I find this money belt useful especially when I have no zipped pockets on my clothes. I could put my money in a bag but when at festivals I prefer to keep my valuables on my person at all times. As well as being more secure it   s easy for me to get to.I can be discreet about taking money out of my belt, often getting it out ready out of sight if I am in a crowd as I do not want to draw attention to it in case someone mugs me to get my possessions.When on holiday I wear this when I do not want to take a bag with me. I wear it when out walking. When we are camping it   s a good place to keep my passport and tickets so I do not leave them on the campsite. This money belt is great for wearing anywhere you need an extra zippered pocket or two to keep your valuables safe on your person.I have had this money belt for several years now  5 or more , can not remember exactly how long, it is still good condition I anticipate it will last several more years. Yes this belt has got dirty (mud at Glastonbury) but being fabric washes ok on a gentle wash cycle.  Thinking about mud and wet yes since this is a fabric bag it might get wet inside so I tend to keep my money notes and paper items in a slim plastic wallet.Yes I would recommend this Gelert money belt unless you have anything fat to put in it.  The R R P is    5.50 this belt can be purchased on line at http://www.outdoorgear.co.uk for    3.19 or at http://www.thearmystore.co.uk for    2.99. There are several on line shops selling it at a similar price.     ::::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5335750:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::6874894:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6691451:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5439461:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6866291:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5203100:4:::5640881:4:::5640881:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Colour Match Set of 4 Coloured Mugs::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::08.03.2011::::    Colour matching mugs I had a smashing time with some mugs recently. I threw away some which were chipped and a couple where the glaze was cracking in the bottom of the mug.I happened to be in the Aylesbury home store   more in Cambridge close and decided to buy a box of 4 colour marching mugs. These mugs came in a white card box which I put in a place in the car where it would not get knocked or fall over .When we got home the mugs were all intact. These mugs cost me    5, they are also available from Argos or home base at    5.99. These 4 mugs are white each with a 2.1/2 cm band of colour around the top. These are different coloured bands one red one blue, one lime green one purple. This is a good idea as you can then tell which mug is yours easily. That way I do not get my mug muddled up with someone else   s in the room. Each mug is a regular height 0f 10 cm I measured it against 2 different mugs. It is a slimmer mug than some of my mugs the colour matching mug measures 7 cm in diameter. The capacity of the mug is 280 ml. The capacity is fine for a mug of teas/coffee or other beverage. These mugs can be washed in hot soapy water, they are dishwasher and microwave safe. So I will be able to reheat my drink when I have let it go cold while I am working at the computer. I have just taken a sip from this mug and it was fine this is not a thin fragile   bone china mug so I am not wary of holding it.  Neither is it a thick chunky mug, so it feels a bit more refined than some of my other mugs. Yes the drinking experience was fine. I am both happy to drink from these mugs myself or offer a drink in them to friends who visit. I can not yet comment on longevity as I have only owned them a month but unless I drop one I expect  these mugs to last several years.Would I recommend? Yes they are good for a cheap mug not lurid design, but not boring white either. Being mostly white these will go with my new white dinner set.     ::::6657747:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6831875:3:::6831875:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::6820455:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5719918:3:::6869878:3:::6869878:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5238639:3:::5238639:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6874894:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6691451:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6866291:4:::5347743:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bonne Maman Confiture-Reine-Claude::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::07.03.2011::::    I have just used a jar of Bonne Maman Reines Claude confiture in other words greengage jam. I bought this last year at a supermarket in France looking on line it seems this  type of Bonne Mamman jam is not in our large supermarkets, but its possible  that you will find it as a lot of Bonne Maman jams  are available in the UK. at http://www.frenchclick.co.uk it cost    2.65  .*Appearance  The jar of Bonne maman jam is distinctive with its 82 mm red and white gingham metal twit of lid over its wide mouth  the  glass jar has 11 facets , these do not just look pretty the facets also make it easy to grip and hold a jar. The jar stands 95 mm tall. The Reines Claude confiture is an amber colour through the jar.*Contents 50g Reines Claude greengages per 100g, total sugar 60g per 100g that does not add up so I guess they are including sugar from the fruit. There is no calorific value on the label or when I looked on line but as with all jams I am guessing it   s high.*AromaTwisting the cap of I get a lovely sweet ripe plumy smell.  This makes me remember the days when my mother use to make huge saucepans full of plum jam.*ConsistencyThis is not a runny jam it is thick with lots of greengages in it. If it is for spreading on bread then you will be spreading it quite thickly not just thinly smearing it on to a slice of bread. The greengages make it quite lumpy so not suitable for wimps who do not like bits in their jam.*Taste. This jam tastes good. It tastes sweet yes it does taste of greengages, a lovely plumy taste. Dipping my finger in just now I have a memory of licking/scraping the pan clean after mum has made some greengage jam the taste is so similar rich sweet fruity. *Price This jam as with the other Bonne Maman brands is more expensive than a Hartley   s or similar brand but I think it is worth it.  As I said I can not find it for sale in the UK by the main super markets but at http://www.frenchclick.co.uk it costs    2.65 in the UK supermarkets Bonne maman jams retail for between    2.000 and    2.50 depending on   fruits used.* Use I used this jam/ confiture to make a jam sponger pudding I put loads of it nearly a whole pot full into the bas of a Pyrex dish and put a 4 egg sponge mix over the top I served this with custard it was delicious, just like mum used to make. I could have used it to make jam tarts with pastry or simply use it to make a greengage jam sandwich.*StorageOnce opened keep in a cool place I keep mine in the fridge. * Recommendations If you like greengages then yes I would certainly recommend this jam* Reines Claude greengages, the fruit. When we go to France in August the Reines Claude greengage plums are ripe they are heavy on the trees and sold in the supermarket or the farmers markets. They are an oval plum with a yellowish green tint.  These plums are a cultivar which was bred in France from a wild greengage.I have had many to eat they are so juicy and sweet. They are a soft fruit with a stone in the middle I like taking a few of these to refresh me when walking in the Pyrenees but  I have to be careful if I sit on the rucksack containing them I get a squashy mess in my bagThe French Reines-Claudes plums are very round with a yellowish green tint. They are incredibly juicy and as sweet as honey. This greengage is called Claude (1499   1524), the Duchess of Brittany, who was the queen consort of  King Francis I of France  Thanks for reading my review. Its strange how foods even just writing about them evoke memories I am now thinking of my good old mum making jam and of being in France in the summer .     ::::9444:3:::9444:3:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6866291:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6834688:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6735325:4:::5816422:4:::6691451:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::6399658:4:::6399658:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6609678:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5203100:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6880480:4:::6880480:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Paprika::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::06.03.2011::::    Looking through my herb /spice shelf I discover some paprika   from Tesco.I looked on line and found this would cost 79p for 52g that   s    1.52 per 100g. Swartz paprika costs    1.47 for 34g that   s    4.32 for 100g. Tesco are  having a buy 3 for the price of 2 atr the mo  but its not worth it for me as I do not use paprika that much .I discover Tesco also sell smoked paprika same price I have yet to use this one. Tesco   s paprika comes in a squared jar with a black plastic flip up lid in the lower part of the lid there are small sprinkle holes. If I want a teaspoon full of paprika I remove the lid and my teaspoon just goes in to the pot. This paprika is a powder it is a dark red brick colour. This Tesco paprika is a mild one. The use by date on Tesco paprika is usually a long one it keeps well in a cool dry place out of sunlight. I sniffed my paprika I did not get much of an aroma. Paprika is  made from Capsicum annuum , bell peppers or chili peppers these are dried then ground to a powder. Strange that I do not really like peppers yet like food with paprika added. I dipped my finger into the paprika pot did not get much  paprika on  it. There was not a great deal of flavour immediately but after a while my mouth tasted spicy warm and sweet not too powerful a kick of spice but nice. Tesco paprika is slightly spicy and sweet in flavour. I like to use it when making a beef stew which I loosely call goulash .My Hungarian goulash is basically a beef stew with onions tomatoes and paprika.  Paprika also goes well with pork or chicken makes them spicy. To see recipes including paprika go to http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/paprika.Paprika is used in many Hungarian, Turkish and Spanish traditional foods. I shall buy Tesco paprika when I need some next as I am satisfied with the results I get from food with this powder added.      ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5238639:3:::5238639:3:::5646482:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6820455:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5437203:3:::5437203:3:::6750576:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6836278:4:::6836278:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6853095:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6880805:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6845486:4:::6716869:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6735325:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6874894:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5439461:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::3M Thinsulate Insulation 40Gram Fleece Gloves::::Sports & Outdoors::::30::::very helpful::::04.03.2011::::     In November I bought some black thinsulate gloves from Aylesbury market they match the thinsulate beanie that I have. I paid    2 for them I have seen them on Amazon for    2.45 also at    4. I am sure I saw these in an outdoor equipment shop somewhere too. However there are many fleece gloves around. Thinsulate are microfibres that provide good insulation. These gloves are available in child, ladies or men   s sizes. I bought the men   s medium they fitted me better than the ladies, my fingers are long.If you are buying gloves I would strongly recommend you try them on to see if they are the right size and if they will keep hands warm. Gloves are often one size or S, M, or L but I find that S. M. l does not mean a great deal one manufacturer   s M will be another   s S.These gloves are made of fleece some thinsulate gloves are knitted I prefer fleece ones. These gloves are available in black blue or grey. I bought black ones. These gloves have a thin fleece strap around the wrist so they can be adjusted tightened to keep them on better and the wind out.These are not a very thick glove which means I can use my hands better to undo/do up things while I have them on, but so far I have found they are good at keeping my hands warm in the frosty and cold mornings, I wear them while on playground duty. I did wear them in the snow after I had thrown a few snow balls as you expect they did get wet. I like the feel of fleece it is soft and comfortable.Unless I use these gloves when out on a conservation work party or  cutting things down in the garden I expect they will last me a couple of winters. It is March now and although looking worn these gloves are still doing fine I hope to  be putting them away in my winter  wear draw soon ready for next year.I was very happy with my gloves, so happy I bought some for other members of the family.     ::::5764692:3:::5764692:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6752066:3:::6752066:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6750576:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6699566:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5285637:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6874193:4:::6874193:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6880805:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6816341:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6869878:4:::6869878:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6691451:4:::6866291:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6367664:4:::5437203:4:::5437203:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Foxs Jam Ring Sandwich Creams::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::03.03.2011::::    Jam Ring Creams I do like a biscuit with a cup of tea .I was offered a Fox   s jam n    cream ring biscuit when I was visiting my friend the other day. She opened the red packet and revealed the biscuits in a plastic tray. The circular biscuits a golden light tan colour are really two biscuits. They are stuck together with a layer of vanilla cream. The upper biscuit has a circle cut out of the centre, a blob of raspberry jam oozes out of the centre this then has sugar sprinkled on it to look like frosting. This biscuit looks a bit like a jammy dodger. I took a biscuit and bit into it hard, but not over hard like a ginger nut biscuit. The biscuit is a little crumbly, but not very. The taste is sweet a plain nearly shortbread taste quite buttery, The vanilla cream is sweet and the raspberry jam is a good flavour I do not notice raspberry seeds  in it. It is a good biscuit a good bite a good taste. I think I prefer these to the jammy dodgers that I compared the look too.I counted the biscuits and there are 10 in a packet (150g), although you could say it was 20 as each biscuit is 2 as I described. Although suitable for vegetarians, Fox   s jam   n cream rings contain Cows Milk, Soya, Wheat and Gluten also made in a factory that uses nutsThere are 80 kcal in each jammy dodger biscuit there are 83 kcal per biscuit.  Although suitable for vegetarians, these biscuits contain cow milk, soya, wheat and gluten. So they are not good for some allergy sufferers.  A pack of these costs 99p at Tesco, 89p at Sainsbury   s 2 packs for one offer at both shops till 1st of March. For comparison Jammy dodgers also 150g packs are also 99p at both shops 50p at Asda. So do I recommend? Yes they go down well.     ::::6766749:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6657747:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6701923:3:::6831875:3:::6831875:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6834688:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6869878:3:::6869878:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6750576:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6735325:4:::6800944:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6864207:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6781956:4:::6691451:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6840580:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6830048:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6876907:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::5816422:4:::6866291:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5362774:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sabichi 12 Piece Porcelain Dinner Set::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::02.03.2011::::    . I decided I needed some more everyday dinner plates so while in Aylesbury after work I visited the Home Store and More shop on the Cambridge close retail park. I decided to buy some very cheap plates. I did not want a patterned ones most of the cheap patterned plates were not to my liking they looked cheap, so I decided on a classic white.My eyes and pocket were drawn to a plates as well but at that price it was worth it to get a matching set. Most of my crockery except for my best Denby are just oddments and do not match. I felt  happy that  my new crockery would not break in the boot of the car on the way home as it came  tightly packed in a cardboard box  which is mostly white with a picture of the crockery on it  A red band at the top of the  box and a black  band at the  side gives information That  it contained Sabichi  super value   12 piece  white porcelain dinner set. I wedged it securely behind some coats and other bags in the boot of the car. Getting the box of crockery I open it. There was nothing broken in between the plates and the bowls were sheets of corrugated card. This set was well packaged. I was pleased with the look of the 4 dinner plates when I took them out of the box. They were nothing exciting really just plain white. These are a large sized diner plates 27 cm in diameter which is slightly wider than some of the other diner plates in my cupboard.  These plates have a 4 cm wide rim. The plates are about 3mm thick so not   thin like my bone china and not thick like some of my more earthen ware plates The only markings on these plates are the words Sabichi living printed in the centre of the base of the plate.I have had several meals off this plate and it does hold a good portion. Although not a stunning design and as nice as my Denby plates I will be quite happy to use this if needs be when entertaining.It is not a heavy thick plate. I washed up in hot soapy water and it has washed well. Although I have no dishwasher (except my husband) the manufacturers say its dishwasher safe. I have not yet used in the microwave but it is also microwave safe.The side plates identical in look to the dinner plates. They are 19 cm in diameter these again are a larger side plate than most of my other ones. I have used one of these once to have my breakfast toast on. I have lots of other small side plates.  The bowls also with a 4 cm flat rim are a matching pure white with no makings except Sabichi living written underneath.The depth of the bowl with sloping sides is not very great only about 2 cms, looks like a deep saucer really.I am glad now that I bought this Sabichi 12 piece white porcelain dinner set. It is cheap enough that I do not worry that the grandchildren might break it. A simple white so it will go with any other tableware and food looks good on it too.I bought my set for    5 from Home store and more. I notice on line Amazon say this wide rimmed set not available through them however at http://www.sabichi.co.uk it is available at    13.50. Sabichi make many dinner sets of various sizes and colours there are a couple of other white designs one the embossed  Dot Dinner Set this has more of a classic bowl shape and there is a set called Blanc which has straight sided bowls. On line these are more expensive than the    5 I paid in the Home Store and More shop.Thanks for reading      ::::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5347743:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6868532:4:::6868532:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6844626:4:::6844626:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6826738:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6880248:4:::6880248:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6786865:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6787939:4:::6787939:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6654302:4:::6654302:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6750576:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6781956:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6735325:4:::5790028:4:::6840580:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6866291:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Roots and Wings Dark Organic Chocolate And Ginger Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::28.02.2011::::    The brown card box of Roots and wings exquisite organic ginger biscuits contain 8 discs of dark chocolate covered gingers biscuits. I received them as a stocking filler for Christmas from my husband and I have refrained from eating them till now. The total weight of all these 8 biscuits is 130 grams. Each individual biscuit measures about 5 cm in diameter nearly 1 cm thick. These biscuits are completely covered in thick chocolate. The chocolate tastes wonderful a rich dark smooth chocolate of good quality. I love dark chocolate I prefer it to milk chocolate.The biscuits are crunchy, they do not taste over gingery , but wait I find that in most bites there is a piece of stem ginger the stem ginger is chewy and as I chew the ginger taste erupts into my mouth to blend with the chocolate flavour mmm. I love chocolate and ginger the tastes compliment each other. These certainly are a good satisfying dark chocolate covered ginger biscuit, they do live up to the exquisite name  that they are given.These biscuits are not cheap for the 130g they cost    2.20 in Tesco These biscuits are made by Roots and Wings a fairly new company producing organic foods  see http://www.rootsandwingsorganic.com/ for further info on this company     ::::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6874894:3:::6786865:3:::5750745:3:::5750745:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6853095:3:::6391230:3:::6391230:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6800944:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6145850:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5203100:3:::6750576:3:::6403007:3:::6403007:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5770646:3:::5770646:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::6779453:3:::6691451:3:::5953084:3:::5953084:3:::6840867:3:::6840867:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::6873980:3:::6873980:3:::5439461:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6873003:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6826738:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6735325:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6781956:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6609678:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Fiddes Payne Mini Marshmallows Pink&White::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.02.2011::::    I wanted to make a rocky road biscuit cake/bar one of the ingredients are marshmallows. When in Tesco   s I bought fiddes Payne pink and white mini marshmallows. *PriceThese cost me    1.09 for a 200g bag that   s 60.6p per 100g . I could have bought the smaller100g bag of dr Oetker marshmallows but they were more expensive at    1.29 for only 18g working out at    7.17 per 100gAt Asda I notice they are 98p per packet.*PackagingThe Fides Payne mini marshmallows come in a pale pink and darker pink striped plastic bag. I snipped the corner of the bag to open it. *SmellThere isn   t one really just smell sweet.*AppearanceThere were lots and  lots of  Small pink white cylinders  of min marshmallows about  1.1/2 cm long 1 cm in diameter.  They had no icing sugar dusting. Look a little but like dense polystyrene packaging.There is about an equal mix of white and pink coloured marshmallows. Fiddes Payne also make a packet of purely white  mini marshmallows , no pink ones  I could not resist popping one into my mouth.*TextureThe texture is soft and spongy, quite chewy. They do not discover in my mouth, one piece can take quite a time to stay there if you let it otherwise its one gulp and its gone. *The taste Sweet no real flavour of anything but sweet.*Ingredients Corn Syrup, Sugar, Water, Gelatine, Modified Starch, Dextrose, Natural Colour (E120), Flavouring. It says flavouring but I can not detect anything other than sweet.*CaloriesIt   s really strange I can find no calorie /nutritional info on the bag at all.  I looked on line found no calorific info there either, most odd.*Recipes There are many recipes using marshmallows. These mini ones are a bit too small to toast around the campfire but great for baking sweet treats or decorating cakes and trifles.  Melted marshmallows are strange they go a bit elastic/rubbery strange textureThere are several recipes on the packaging of these marsh mallows or look on line at http://www.campfiremarshmallows.com loads of recipes there. A favourite recipe is to add a few mini marshmallows to chocolate crispy cakes or make a type of rocky road like I did.  I crushed 200g digestive biscuits could have used rich tea biscuits instead. melted 200g chocolate, 135g of margarine and the 2-3 tablespoons of golden syrup, stirred in the crushed biscuits and 100g marshmallows, I also added some raisins, could have added nuts but  didn   t do not like nuts.When mixed I put in baking tray and cooled, when cold cut into lots of pieces. This is a lovely chocolaty biscuit bar with chewy marshmallows   mmmmm. I have also used these to decorate cakes the white ones look a bit like snowballs. Children seem to like marshmallows these little ones good for helping them practice fine motor skills and that pincer grip when picking them up. Working with special needs children I have to think of ways to  inspire    encourage movement. These mini marshmallows are also fun to put into a hot chocolate drink they float and melt. Here we are learning about changes and the effect of heat.*StorageI bought my packet in January the best before date November 11. Once opened you need to keep them airtight as after a day they harden and will soon become as hard as bulletsFiddes Payne is a relatively new company established in 1993, selling herbs and spices in 1999 they started producing home baking items.Would I recommend these mini marshmallows? Yes they are fun     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6781956:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5347743:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6800944:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5790028:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6843355:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6609678:4:::5817619:4:::5817619:4:::6390014:4:::6701923:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::3957:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6735325:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6866291:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6873003:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6840580:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5203100:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6750576:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bruin My First Bruin Soft Cubes::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.02.2011::::    I have played with these 4 Bruin soft cubes many times with children with special needs. These cubes are suitable for babies from birth, they are safe.  Made of polyester fabrics.Most of the 6 walls that make up one of the Bruin softcubes is made of a slightly different fabric either colour or texture. The fabric colours are soft yellow, purple, blue and orange not bright colours.  Most of the sides have a design on them for example there is a picture of an elephant on one this is on a stripy background as is the picture of a bear on a different cube. The fabric that these designs are on is a non fluffy polyester texture, Then on a soft velvety fabric wall there is a butterfly stitched on, on another cube there is a harp outline stitched on I know children feel these outlines and trace then with a finger.Inside each of these soft cubes there must be a bell as they make a jingly sound when moved and shaken.I will hold and rattle one of these bricks for a child, see if the child will turn their head to look to find out where the noise is coming from, I play a game hiding the cube and rattling it out of thier sight to see if they will turn their head. Then as a reward I give the child the cube to hold and rattle themselves. I will hold one of these cubes just on the edge of a child   s reach and hope they will reach out to grasp and take it. I may use one of these cubes as a ball throwing it to the child it jingles as it goes through the air and lands in their lap. Although these are cubes they will not really stack together they are too soft but they will pile up together. These soft cubes are quite durable ours are several years old look tatty though. These  are from http://www.toysrus.co.uk/Babies-R-Us where they cost    9.99 .     ::::6804844:3:::6804844:3:::6860710:3:::6860710:3:::6654302:3:::6654302:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6843584:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::6743447:3:::6743447:3:::5439461:3:::6778028:3:::6778028:3:::5764692:3:::5764692:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5347743:4:::6781956:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6873003:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::3957:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6826738:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6874894:4:::6869137:4:::6869137:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6691451:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6866291:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6840580:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6816341:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6871656:4:::6871656:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Currant And Cinnamon Cakey Cookies::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::22.02.2011::::    I bought a pack of these cookies from Tesco last week it cost me    1.25 and I ate 1 last night.These cookies (I really hate that word) or biscuits come in a red packet with a picture of a few fat currant cookies on it, no mistaking what   s inside. I opened up the red packet and in a plastic tray were 8 of these fat round cookies (sounds a bit like me :-)). The packet contains 299g, so that   s 50g per cookie. There are 105 calories in each cookie. As well as currants and cinnamon they do contain wheat flour butter and skimmed milk.There is not a very long best before date on these cookies mine was only a few weeks. I expect this is because these are a moist cake like cookie that goes stale quicker than a hard bite biscuit.These cookies look quite attractive a   brown colour with quite a lot of currants showing a cracked not smooth surface, almost a home baked look. When eating the smell of food is important and these   smell of fruit and a little spice smell a bit like a fruit cake might.  I take a bite yes they are soft the currants are soft too. The cookie stays together well, it is not crumbly. Yes more like a cake than a biscuit, I would not recommend dunking these.  A pleasant sweet but not oversweet currant fruity taste I can only just detect the cinnamon which is a shame prefer a stronger taste.  I do like these and might buy them again if I am not baking. These cookies are quite satisfying they are filling so not too many, one would be than enough.If unlike us you do not eat the whole packet store them in an airtight container.So would I recomend? Yes these are good maybe not the best but good.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6843584:3:::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::6818102:3:::6691451:3:::6725337:3:::6725337:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6496990:3:::6496990:3:::6845273:3:::6845273:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5439461:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5975369:4:::5975369:4:::6609678:4:::6869137:4:::6869137:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6826738:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6866291:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Butterfly Wand::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.02.2011::::    My grand daughter loves pink and to be a fairy or a princess so my mothering law bought her a fairy wand from John Lewis as part of her Christmas gifts . This wand costs    2.50 on or off line to see it go to http://www.johnlewis.com/230858087/Product.aspx. This wand was unwrapped with delight by my 5 year old granddaughter it is suitable for over 3 year olds. This wand is made of a plastic which has a silver chrome effect. The top of the wand is shaped like a butterfly it is very sparkly. The butterfly has two curly antennae .Attached to the centre of the butterfly are pink marabou feather s wow they are bright really pink quite fluffy feathers, they seem to be attached well. There are 4 pink gems in the centre 1 in each butterfly wing s, the gems are plastic of course. This butterfly is very pretty attractive to little girls. The stick of the wand is a silver plastic with jewel effect too. The wand is about 35cm long. My granddaughter danced and pranced about singing with glee, making spells with her wand but oops after about 10 minutes disaster struck...... ~~~~~~~~~~ ~* The wand broke very near the top, I am not sure but I think my granddaughter may have tried to make her brother disappear, she only tapped him with it , it was not a hard blow. My granddaughter was disappointed fortunately she did not burst into tears we said we could probably fix it later. I do not know what happened to the broken pieces but we did not fix it I think they got thrown away. I could probably have done a fix for a short time by taping the wand together So although this wand looked great, it was not very durable and a waste of mother in law s money. I suspect a lot of wands suffer these stem breakages as the fairies wave them around.      ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5439461:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6750576:3:::6846862:3:::6846862:3:::6870095:3:::5719918:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6866291:4:::6691451:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6876907:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::3957:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6190414:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6840580:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6805327:4:::6805327:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6835564:4:::6835564:4:::6800944:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6830048:4:::6874894:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5857845:4:::5857845:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5203100:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::5362774:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Butterfly Tiara::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::19.02.2011::::     She is gorgeous in her butterfly tiara that she received for Christmas she looks beautiful and happy too. My granddaughter twirls and struts around the house her head held high. This tiara is only off her head for bed and for school. My granddaughter visits every weekend and she always  has her tiara on her head.My granddaughter is nearly 5 this tiara suitable for a three year old and over.This butterfly tiara is made of plastic it is covered in a silvery chrome effect it is very sparkly. The butterfly centre front of the tiara is bejeweled with pink sparkly plastic gems like the wand it has 2 curly antennae. There are silvery embellishments at the side of the butterfly. The base of the tiara that sits on my granddaughters head is covered in pale pink fluffy marabou feathers the tiara is really pretty. The tiara fits nicely on my granddaughter   s head I think it would be fine fitting for a 3 year old to about 6 maybe even 7 years old. The crown of the tiara must be comfortable as my granddaughter wears it for a long time, hours in one session and has said it is comfortable. This tiara is more long lasting than the matching wand she also had for Christmas and after examening it I think should last a long time.  The tiara is slightly flexible and not brittle.This tiara costs    3.50 from John Lewis I think it was worth it.   This is a very pretty tiara and I think well made it is comfortable to wear and my little princess has already had many hours of pleasure from it.As well as a princess my granddaughter is also a fairy with her tiara and some wings she has. My granddaughter also has a pretty pink dress she loves to bits and the pink Marabou feathers compliment the dress. I think this tiara is good play value allowing my granddaughters imagination to reach grand heights. It would also be a great prop for the school play.Yes this butterfly tiara is a success well worth the money spent on it.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5719918:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6843584:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5816422:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6843355:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6844462:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6845486:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5203100:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6866291:4:::6850640:4:::6850640:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Dried Thyme::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::20.02.2011::::    Have you got the Thyme? I have, I have some Tesco dried thyme I just added a sprinkle to the casserole that I am going to cook today.  This Herb comes in a black lidded square base flat sided jar containing 16 g it fits nicely on my spice rack. I could buy a replacement today for 50p compared to Schwartz at    1.12 for 11g.This jar of Dried Thymes sits in the herb section at Tesco on or off line. I opened my jar it has a hole for pouring the thyme out of not a small sprinkler holes. It smelt good, a summer smell like walking through herbs on the Chiltern chalk land where I live. I pour some out tiny little chopped portions of leaves. . I add Thyme leaves to any casserole, or sprinkle some on pork or lamb chops when cooking them. If I am roasting chicken sometimes I add  Thyme , if I were to make stuffing from old bread crumbs I could use thyme as it is an ingredient in some commercial  stuffing   s . How much do I use?  that   s difficult to say as I rarely measure . Dried herbs are stronger than fresh ones I would use about 1/2 less dried Thyme as opposed to fresh. For a beef casserole I would add     to 1 tspoon for 250g beef.  It goes well in a tomato dish I sometimes add tomatoes to my beef.Thyme is very aromatic I love the smell of foods while they are cooking with it. The Thyme taste is very distinctive gives a lovely aromatic taste to foods.There are lots of recipes using Thyme at http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes. The Tesco dried Thyme is as good as any other dried Thyme that I have used. Do be warned if you have allergies reading the label I discover that it may contain traces of nuts and sesame seeds I guess that   s because the factory produces them too. There is usually a good long best before  date on this product , mine is out of date  but it  still smells fairly strong  , The older it is  the taste will not be as strong so I shall use a larger quantity in my cooking  and try and finish the jar.I do have Thyme in my garden it grows well I do use it for cooking, not sure why I bought the dried Thyme. Thyme is a short woody shrub grows well on dry soils it has small leaves. In ancient Greece it   s a symbol of courage a sprig of thyme often given by the women to warriors before going to war. Perhaps I should give some to my husband before he goes in to teach his unruly class at school Thyme is often alluded to in fairy and magical stories William Shakespeare Quote:  quot;I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows.    Spoken by Oberon in Act 2, Scene 1 about where Titania sleeps. So from Tesco   s dried Thyme my thoughts go to Shakespeare and back again I must go and put my casserole in the oven and continue sorting my herb and spice rack.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Ground Cinnamon::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::18.02.2011::::     I enjoy baking and I spice that I often use is cinnamon. I have a glass jar containing 40g from Tesco. This is a small squared flat jar with a black lid. This jar fits well on my and most other spice racks.The top of the lid lifts to reveal sprinkler holes in the lower part of the lid. These holes are a good size and the small brown grains (they are almost a powder) of cinnamon fall through it if the jar inverted and shaken. Remove the complete lid if you wish to delve a teaspoon in, one will just fit. I love the warm sweet spicy aroma of cinnamon when I open the lid makes me hungry for spicy biscuits or hot cross buns.I find the Tesco ground cinnamon as good as any other that I have used. This Tesco ground cinnamon cost 65p for 40 g Swartz ground cinnamon costs    1.48 for 33g cheaper is Asda where 32g of cinnamon cost 50p.  Tesco has the cinnamon on offer at 3 jars for    1.20 till the end of March. Although the best before dates are quite long time into the future I am not sure that I would use that much before the grains lost a lot of flavour, as they do when they get old.I love home made hot cross buns which have cinnamon. Cinnamon goes very well with apple and if making an apple pie I sometimes add cinnamon instead of mixed spiceT he cinnamon is easy to add to pies or cakes either sprinkle in or add that measured teaspoon. Stir  into vakes it disperses well.If you wanted to find recipes for using cinnamon go to http://allrecipes.com//Recipes/herbs-and-spices/spices/cinnamon.  Although cinnamon is available and used all year I really love cinnamon as an autumn through winter into spring spice there are many Christmas and Easter recipes using it. I find both the taste and smell very warm and comforting. Be warned if you have a nut allergy the cinnamon from Tesco is from a factory that uses nuts and sesame so there might be traces. Cinnamon in case you did not know is the bark of a cinnamon tree, the cinnamon tree grows about 50 ft high and is evergreen. The bark is ground into fine grains or rolled into sticks. So would I recommend Tesco ground cinnamon ? Yes        ::::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6220775:3:::6220775:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5719918:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6750576:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5439461:3:::5646482:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6844462:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6805406:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6816341:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5362774:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ladies Jyoti Fur Bootie Slippers::::Fashion::::30::::very helpful::::14.02.2011::::    For Christmas my daughter bought me some Jyoti slippers I had actually dropped a huge hint that I needed some new slippers.She bought then from EBay and I have found it hard to find them anywhere else on line.I expect she paid    10 for them as this is the price I have seen them for.I was really glad she bought me these as they are so comfortable cosy and snug. These booties are made of a faux suede effect fabric they are fur lined. The sole of the slippers is also fur lined. The fabric is thick and warm very soft. They have a fold down/up collar at the ankle  this is great as although I prefer the look when the  collar is turned down turned up it will keep my ankles warm. On the outside by the heel there are a couple of ribbons made of the same fabric these are tied in a bow. .These ribbons are attached to the slipper they are not threaded through so do not pull the collar tight around the ankle.There is a seam around the collar and one down the side by the heel these are booth well stitched and secureThese slippers have a good sole it is suitable for going outside in I do not have to remove my slippers to take rubbish out to the bin. However I do usually remove them so they do not get too dirty.Now when I read booties  I gringe a bit as it makes me feel old,  apart from babies I always think of old ladies who can not walk much . However these are not especially old lady   ish.As I said I was really pleased with these slippers  until one day I had not tied the ribbons up they were loose and  one got caught in the door as I stepped forward  the fabric  pulled on the side of the slipper ripped it is quite a big rip . I was disappointed however I got a needle and some tan coloured strong thread and sewed up the tear making a reasonable repair job. Stupidly one day after this I had also left the ties/ribbon on the other slipper loose guess what? I now have matching slippers both with repairs. I expect they will not last me as long as I would have liked because of this. I have now removed/cut of the ribbon   s as I suspect I might get them trapped again.Even with the repair I do like these slippers. They are cosy they fit me well I have quite a wide foot. At night I take them off downstairs by the front door as I go to bed and then they are by the front door to put on as soon as I get home from work in the evening. I am wearing them now.I have had slippers before but I have not usually wear them as frequently as these ones, is it that I find them so comfy or is it just because I am getting older. So would I recommend these? Wellll? I think so they are so cosy, I think the fabric ripped because I was careless the ribbons really did get well caught up in the door and I pulled my foot forward.  These slippers are available in sizes up to and including size 8.The name Jyoti it an Indian one meaning light , flameINCLUDING SIZE 8     ::::5633146:4:::5285637:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6874550:4:::6874550:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6866291:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6850650:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5362774:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6875788:4:::6875788:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5719918:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6816341:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Kellogg's Elevenses Cherry Oat Bake::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::17.02.2011::::    If we are going for a long walk or a long car ride I often pack some sort of cereal bar to nibble on. I bought a pack of Kellogg elevenses the cherry variety for a change.  These are available in a cardboard box containing 6 individually wrapped bars.  At the moment these cost    2.22 from Tesco and Ocado, Sainsbury   s have them on offer for    1.50 till march 8th.These cherry elevenses are individually wrapped in a dark red plastic wrapper these wrappers are not too difficult to tear open.  Opening there is a light sweet  oaty smellThese bars look quite attractive a good dark brown with bits of fruit in it.  This bar tastes very sweet, a bit too sweet for me really. I can taste the oats and golden syrup and yes I do get some cherry flavour.   The texture of this bar is soft yet has pieces of oat and fruit in it some of these pieces get stuck in my teeth for a while after eating a bite. The pieces of fruit are small and soft they do not remind me of cherry though. I look in the ingredient list and discover that the red fruit are dried sweetened cranberries  What no cherries Kellogg   s.  I read further and discover cherry flavouring in the ingredient list.  Chewing a mouthful yes I can make out the cherry flavour. I copied an ingredient list for you. Milk in these bars means they are not suitable for those with dairy allergies.Ingredients are :- Whole Rolled Oats (33 ), Invert Sugar Syrup, Vegetable Oil, Apple, Glucose Syrup, Sweetened Dried Cranberries (8 )(Sugar, Cranberries), Sugar, Wheat Flour, Golden Syrup (Partially Inverted Sugar Syrup), Cherry Flavouring, Dried Skimmed Milk, Emulsifiers (E475, Soy Lecithin), Modified Starch, Salt, Flavouring, Citric Acid, Raising Agent (E500), Stabiliser (Guar Gum), Antioxidant (Ascorbic Acid), Niacin, Iron, Vitamin B6, Riboflavin (B2), Thiamin (B1), Folic Acid, Vitamin B12. These bars are fat bars about 9-10 cm long weigh 50g each. There are 205 kcal in each bar. They are quite satisfying This is a soft moist bar it is quite filling, filling that hunger gap on a walk before we get to the pub for lunch. . To see all the types of elevenses bars go to http://www.kelloggs.co.uk/products/elevenses/Bar/elevenses_raisin_bake.aspx.  At 37p full price these are about the same price as other cereal bars, more filling than a chocolate bar for the same price.However I am not sure that I like these ever so much prefer the Kellog   s elevenses raisin bakes.     ::::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6750576:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6787939:3:::6787939:3:::6874550:3:::6874550:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6723034:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6562051:4:::6562051:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6800944:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6826738:4:::6824315:4:::6824315:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6691451:4:::6874894:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6657747:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5362774:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6818102:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6816341:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6866291:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 5506 Brick Box::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::13.02.2011::::    The R R P of this large box of Duplo 5506 is    25.99 http://www.amazon.co.uk is selling it for    24.99  but cheaper is http://www.everydaysale.co.uk at 19.95.There   have  been  many small and large boxes of Duplo made by Duplo since 1969 they are made by the Lego company which has been making Lego years since 1958  when  carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen who   s company made wooden toys, stepladders started to produce   the small plastic Lego brick. I have had vast experience of playing with Duplo Lego bricks alongside children I started my career working with children in 1972. This large box 5506 is one which a class I have worked with uses. This plastic box measuring 19.2 x 37.7 x 22 cm weighs 1.1 Kg is a lime green with a transparent lid.  This and the other plastic storage boxes that Duplo comes in is fantastic its strong will last for many years easy to store, easy to clean. It   s easy for the children to put the bricks in at clearing up time. ( whether they do so willingly is a different matter)Inside the box comes a booklet with plans and ideas for building Duplo constructions.There are 71 Duplo bricks in this box.  There is an assortment of cojoining coloured bricks red, blue, yellow, green.  A good variety of sizes and shapes, 4 studs, 4 stud with a slope added. 2 stud   s with a slope added, 8 stud, there are small flat base plates there is a brick with wheels to construct a vehicle with also a Duplo person wearing a hat he has moveable limbs. There is also a green   and a yellow flower shape which when stuck together looks like a flower growing on leaves. This box has a good basic range of Duplo bricks.The children and I have made towers, houses various  vehicles including cars lorries , busses and an aeroplane, imagination is the limit  even then I am not sure what some of the building   s  the children  have constructed are. Duplo bricks are suitable for children aged over 18 months old. The bricks are twice the size of Lego bricks and as your child gets older and uses the smaller Lego the bricks are compatible. Depending on your child   s ability these Duplo bricks should hold their interest till they are about 5 years or 6 years old.The age which they are really good for is 2 -4. I like Duplo bricks they are safe, too big to get swallowed. Your child will be learning while they are playing practicing their hand eye coordination their spatial awareness, their construction skills. Learning their colours do play with your child and name the colours from an early age then they will soon pick the colour names up.You can also teach your child concepts such as on, under up and down, high, low, big, little, in, out by building and talking about their building with them. Go on put a yellow brick on the red brick, what a high building you are building pass me the green brick it is under the lid,  counting is fun how tall is your tower ? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, bricks high mine is shorter only 4 bricks. Time to tidy up now put the bricks in the box.OK lesson over. I just like playing with Duplo bricks for fun, I expect I will be found playing with Duplo bricks till I retire probably after retirement too whenever I am around young children. This   Duplo box 5506 is a really good starter box both for home or school enough bricks to build something with, there is space inside the box to add a few extra bricks if you should buy more vehicles or people packs.  Duplo bricks are easy to clean just wash in warm soapy water. They are very durable too my daughters  basic bricks  have lasted 30 years  they were put in the loft  and  her children  now aged 8 and 5  still have them about to pass them on to  someone else. Yes you guessed it I recommend this toy.     ::::6877883:3:::5633146:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6691451:4:::6145850:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6758309:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6723034:4:::6843584:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6781956:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6875788:4:::6875788:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6874894:4:::5786498:4:::5719918:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5816422:4:::6818102:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6654507:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840580:4:::5625800:4:::5625800:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::6866291:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6750576:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Dried Oregano::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::12.02.2011::::     I have a jar of dried marjoram on my spice /herb rack. I use it quite often. I have fresh marjoram growing in my garden so this dried one is usually for winter use This glass jar is squared straight sides, this fits well in a standard spice rack.  The jar label is black and has green grass like design on the bottom edge of it. I just read that it may contain sesame and nut traces due to being made in factory  that uses them. The jar has a round black flip top lid. Flip the lid open and there is a semi circular hole to pour the oregano out of. The oregano which has been chopped fairly fine comes out fast. IO will sometimes take the complete lid of to get a complete tea spoon full , a teaspoon will just go into the circular jar top.This is a good dried herb I use it in many dishes ideal in a lot of Italian  pasta meals  goes very well with tomato dishes. I love a little sprinkle of Oregano on my pork chop with a little garlic remember to use less   dried oregano than fresh  or  the dish might taste a little bitter 3 tsp of fresh oregano = 1 tsp of dried oregano. I will use 1 teaspoon dried oregano to a beef stew containing 1-2 lb just under 1kg of beef. There are many recipes using this herb at http://homecooking.about.com  The use by date is on the collar of the black lid opening my jar of oregano  I smell the sweet herby aroma I like this smell. The taste of oregano is warm and aromatic it is slightly bitter This Tesco dried oregano containing 14g will cost 52p that   s    3.71 per 100g and contains 14g. The Swartz jar maybe slightly more attractive contains 7g and costs    1.00 that   s    14 per 100g I have used both and can find no real difference in flavour so will buy the Tesco one in preference or use my own from the gardenOregano is botanically known as Origanum vulgare it tastes very similar to marjoram, marjoram botanically known as Origanum majorana is a slightly gentler flavour slightly sweeter, more delicate not quite as pungent the two are often confusedOregano often known as wild marjoram or the joy of the mountains.     ::::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6875788:4:::6875788:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6781956:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6818102:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5790028:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6840580:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6757811:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6866291:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::6588100:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Tesco Ground Mixed Spice::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::09.02.2011::::    Last time I did some baking I realized I had run out of mixed spice so when I went to Tesco at the weekend I bought some mixed spice. I bought Tesco   s own mixed spice (ground) rather than Schwartz. The price was what persuaded me. Tesco   s spice costs 52p for 37 g working out at    1.41 per 100g. The Swartz mixed spice costs    1.47 for 28g that   s    5.25 per 100g.The Tesco clear glass spice jar is not as attractive as the Schwartz jar it   s square sides are straight not curvy like the Schwartz jar. The black top is square not circular.This spice mix is for sweet dishes not curry.This weekend I added some Tesco mixed spice to a fruit cake and an apple pudding cake. I have previously used mixed spice in many cakes and deserts.  A lot of seasonal both Christmas and Easter bakes include mixed spice. Mixed spice is really nice added to apple pies. About a teaspoon of spice added to the apple will enhance the taste of apple pie. There are several recipe   s for caked using spice at http://www.cooksunited.co.uk/rs/s0/mixed+spice+cake/recipes.html.I open the flip top lid and there are several holes in the next layer of the lid to act as a shaker to shake the spice out of. These holes are not tiny pin pricks but a good size so that when I shake some spice on to the pie a sprinkling comes out not too much at a time. The spice is a brown powder of fine grains I wanted a teaspoon full of spice so I twisted the top and it came completely off the top of the jar large enough for me to dip my small teaspoon into.The smell of this spice is nice, makes me feel hungry for a hot cross bun. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, so I ate my pudding of apple pie and I could taste the spicy flavouring. Yes Mr. Tesco I was satisfied the blend of spicy flavour   s good.I shall certainly be buying Tesco   s mixed spice again.Mixed spice is a British blend of spices, sometimes called British spice also it can be called pudding spice. Mixed spice has been around since the early 1800   s. This mixed spice contains cinnamon, coriander, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and caraway. Although nut free it is made in a factory containing nuts. Aromatic spices are blended together to make a sweet spice.      ::::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5335750:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::6818102:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6190414:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6657747:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6691451:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5808829:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6826738:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6779453:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6860859:4:::6860859:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6866291:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5362774:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Asics Lady Gel Cardio Walking Shoe::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::19.10.2010::::    For 5 years I have had Achilles tendonitis, first in one foot and when that was better in the other. I am now free of this problem my feet no longer hurt to walk I can run skip and hop, well nearly.When I visited my physiotherapist about the pain in my foot one day he recommended Asics trainers with gel in the soles   . I bought my self some Asics fabric trainers which were fantastic. When the weather got to be wet and winery about 20 months ago I investigated and bought a pair of Asics Gel cardio walking shoes. When trying them on in the shop I bought the men   s ones these fitted me best.  I need a larger size than before I had this foot problem as my foot has increased from a size 6 to a 7 and  with wearing the innersole that the hospital gave me I needed the  size 8 to fit my    Cinderella    foot in. These walking shoes are black leather the have the stripe design on the side of the shoes which is the Asics trade mark.  The stripes are black leather too.  This leather is soft and supple. This design is a lace up shoe. The sole is quite thick and has grips It   s not a smooth sole.  This pair of shoes has Asics  Gel Cushioning technology the gel enables optimal shock absorption.The innersole is made of a firmer material than most sports shoes. The shoe upper is a  good leather it is soft and well made. The heel of the shoe is well formed it is a personal heel fit it is soft and cushioned and cradles the foot. On the outer heel is a small reflective strip. The black upper shoe leather has been treated to add shine and water repellence. The inner of the shoe is fabric, coloured bamboo charcoal Lined which has antibacterioral properties to keep the shoes fresh. It also absorbs moisture and is comfortable. I have worn these shoes many times for everyday walking, at work and in town. I have worn these shoes as my walking shoes while on holiday.The leather is still looking good, I clean it wit a liquid shoe polish. There seems to be very little wear on the soles of the shoesWhen I put these shoes on they feel comfortable, my foot feels supported. When I walk in these shoes they feel good when I had the pain from my injured tendon it hurt a lot less in these shoes. I think the sole in the shoes made this difference and when I added the innersoles from the hospital I barely felt the pain.These Asics soles are suitable for many foot health problems, they are recommended for foot problems connected to type II diabetes sufferers.I bought mine from a sports shop where I tried on many pairs of shoes and walked around the shop many times. I think the staff were getting fed up with how long I was there eventually I decided These Asics gel cardio walking shoes  were comfortable and suitable. I can not remember exactly what I paid for mine they were in a sale when I purchased. Looking on line I find it   s  impossible to buy the ladies version of this shoe now , You can still get the men   s version  of the Asics  gel cardio at  http://www.milletsports.co.uk the RRP    90.00 but on aisle for    64.99 The ladies version was    57.59 at Amazon when it was still available. it has been replaced with Asics Gel-Cardio 2  Ladies Shoes  and Asics Gel-Cardio 3 Ladies Shoes. I have not tried these on but I imagine they are as good as or better than the Asic shoes I have. I do notice a slight style difference in that the fastening is strap across with Velcro on. Personally I prefer a lace up.However even though my feet are better now when it comes time to buy some more walking shoes I shall defiantly try some Asics on as I really  do trust this brand to be comfortable and durable .  Yes I do recommend these shoes whether you have a foot problem or not. ASICS is a Japanese athletic equipment company. Their sports shoes and trainers are well respected amongst sports men and women.       ::::5719918:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6757811:4:::6800944:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6701923:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6843584:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::3957:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5817619:4:::5817619:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5414290:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::5347743:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6834688:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5203100:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6844462:4:::6830048:4:::6816341:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5318403:5:::5318403:5:::6840867:5:::6840867:5:::5891:5:::5891:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hasbro In the Night Garden Ninky Nonk Train Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.12.2010::::    In The Night Garden Ninky Nonk Vehicle This toy cost    9.99 at Argos or    13.48 +    4.99 delivery from Amazon. Over the past 2 years I have played with this toy alongside children. The night garden is a popular TV programme for children about 2 to 4 years old. Certainly my 5 year old grand daughter seems to have outgrown it.There are many products made that are related to this programme. This Ninky nonk train is one. This train is made up of 5 vehicles it looks identical to the one your child will see on the television. These 5 vehicles are come in 3 sections The red boat shaped vehicle is a piece on its own the ball shaped vehicle ad the little house shaped one come together as one piece the third piece is the rectangular carriage and the oval dome shaped one. This Ninky Nonk train is not a large toy it measures 76x279x140mm when all connected together.This train is made out of plastic the colours of the carriages are the same as the ones on the programme they are soft muted colours blues, red , yellow , green orange not vibrant shades of these colours. This is a push along toy now batteries or keys to turnThe toy that I know has been played with by many children and each individual carriage seems well made, however there is one draw back the pieces do not stay together for long when it is given the sort of ride that my children give it they carriages get untendered from the next one. This can be frustrating.However the children seem to enjoy playing this reliving those night garden moments and making journeys across the floor with this train. This train will provide your child with practice for their fine motor and gross motor skills. It will provide fodder for their imagination and pretend play.This toy does not come with the night garden figures but we have them they were bought separately. So if your tot enjoys in the night garden then I think they would like this toy.      ::::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6750576:3:::5633146:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5247678:4:::5247678:4:::6691451:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5203100:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6830048:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6840580:4:::6539681:4:::6539681:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6866291:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galt Colour Puzzles Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.08.2010::::    There is often one of this set of 4 puzzles on the table for the children at work to do. They are suitable for children over 18 months old and can be linked to the foundation stage key stage 1. Each of these puzzles is dedicated to a specific colour, one puzzle red one green, another blue and a yellow one too. The puzzles measure 27cm x27cm. Each tray puzzle has a white surround and 9 insert puzzle pieces. The shapes and pictures on these insets are of items that will be familiar to a young child and in a colour you might find them in. The red puzzle has red boots, a red apple a strawberry a teapot, a fire engine, a bucket and spade, a balloon and the central piece is a blob coloured red. . The other coloured jigsaws feature other appropriately coloured items such as a star piece on the yellow jigsaw and a tree on the green one. Under each puzzle piece on the base of the tray is a picture of the piece that fits it. This does make it easier for your child to complete the puzzle as they match the picture as well as look at the shape of the puzzle insert. These pieces each have a small peg attached this peg is coloured the same as the jigsaw colour theme. These pegs are quite easy to grip making fitting the puzzle insert pieces easier for those with poor manipulative skills. These puzzles are great for teaching colour recognition and for practicing fine motor control, and hand eye coordination. Good for your Childs language development if while sitting alongside them while they do the puzzle you name and get them to name both the colour and the object. However this does not mean you have to sit and supervise these puzzles as they are ones that can be done independently. This set of puzzles is from Galt and well made from a wooden board. They are very durable will last ages. They are suitable for both home and education facility.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Antiseptic Wipes 10::::Health::::40::::very helpful::::03.01.2011::::    These Tesco antiseptic wipes are handy to have in the first aid kit in the car and also useful for taking on holiday. At least that s where I use them, at home I can easily wash a wound and use a liquid antiseptic like detol, savlon or TCP from a bottle dabbed on with tissue or cotton wool. These Tesco antiseptic wipes cost 87p for a pack of ten. The Savlon wipes cost    2.00 in Sainsbury s for a pack of 10. These Tesco antiseptic wipes come in a green coloured card box which has a picture of a hand wiping a cut knee with one of the wipes at least mine do the picture here on dooyoo is slightly different . These antiseptic wipes are individually wrapped this helps keep them clean for use on a wound. I have used these wipes on scratches on my legs from barbed wire (my tetanus jabs are up to date.) and thorns that I get when out walking in the countryside sometimes. I have soothed my grand children s scratches and  quot;war wounds quot; with them. The individual sachets are fairly easy to tear open and take out the folded tissue that has been presoaked in antiseptic. This tissue is damp the sachet seals the moisture in well. These do smell slightly of antiseptic, not unpleasantly though and after a while the smell on the skin where it is applied loses that smell. These wipes are gentle on the skin and are ideal for wiping dirt gently away from a wound, ideal for small scrapes and grazes. The antiseptic wipes are gentle do not sting. I find that when my grandchildren fall over outside and then get their wound wiped with one of these it helps calm them as well as cleaning the wound, just an extra bit of TLC and a nana kiss and hug works wonders at drying those tears. I feel reassured using an antiseptic wipe that the wounds are as clean as I can get them and germs should not cause a problem in the wound. After using one of these antiseptic wipes depending on the cut I will cover the wound with a plaster to keep it clean. I find these antiseptic wipes work well for my purposes, luckily I do not have to use them often, but if I want something to give me the reassurance of a clean wound then I am happy to use these.      ::::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5335750:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5203100:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6781956:4:::6866291:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6757811:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::6841262:4:::6869626:4:::6869626:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5362774:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6826738:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5347743:4:::6735325:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840580:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Swizzel Love Hearts::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::07.06.2004::::    Love hearts are these a Childs sweet? Swizzles have made love hearts since the 1950s. So what are love hearts? Love hearts are a sweet small and round about the size of a    1 coin. These sweets are enclosed in a very plain paper Wrapper, pastel coloured . They all fit together and are wrapped making a small cylinder of sweets The sweets again are pale pastely colours   peach pink green yellow, white.  They are a round sweet with a heart piped/ embossed on to one side. In this heart is a message, be mine, I love you; email me, best friends, true love. There are I believe about 200 possible messages. Some might be suitable for mum on mothers day or maybe your wife when she has just produced your first baby the words I love mum  These sweets are sold in pkts with about 20-22 sweets or in small pkts of about 8 sweets. The larger pkts retail about 25-30p the smaller pkts are available in multi bags. Also available are love hearts especially designed as wedding favours packets of 7 sweets with words such as marry me, just married 100 rolls 27 pounds from swizzles web site. These sweets are very sweet almost too sweets so you do not want to eat many. They are very sugary and have a mild fruit flavour. Also they contain a lot of  colourings so might send your child high.  There is quite a bit of love hearts merchandise around mouse mats and photo frames with dream boy written in the heart space where the photo will go, love heart mugs.  These sweets are mostly eaten / bought by young teenage girls who giggle over the words and who they would like to give them /or receive them from. They can be a subtle hint if you offer a sweet to that boy you really fancy if you have sorted them out so the one at the top you offer him says be mine, or call me. I seem to remember when hubby was at college while we were dating he might include a love heart in the daily letter. (Yes we wrote everyday we were apart). It used to give me a warm feeling. When my daughter got married we put a few love hearts on the tables as decorations people did have fun reading the message. I did not realise then that Swizzles made special wedding favor packs. If you are getting married I would certainly recommend them. The messages in these sweets are all innocent, no sexy messages just soppy cute love messages. In recent years they have introduced the messages such as fax me email me. Thanks for reading about this sweet way of giving your love a love message Mary      ::::5491888:3:::5403378:3:::5366658:3:::5366658:3:::5211882:3:::5211882:3:::5512121:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5251362:3:::5348537:3:::5348537:3:::5433745:3:::5433745:3:::5326039:3:::3517:3:::3517:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5368530:3:::5368530:3:::5186846:3:::5065833:3:::5326632:3:::5326632:3:::5223538:3:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5020702:4:::5515077:4:::5515077:4:::5078622:4:::5078622:4:::5270615:4:::5479386:4:::5253113:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5454586:4:::5341731:4:::5326218:4:::5326218:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5381213:4:::21918:4:::5248345:4:::5435242:4:::5435242:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5412163:4:::5412163:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::5015764:4:::5428126:4:::5389575:4:::5389575:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5240548:4:::5370096:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5487912:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5268739:4:::5373212:4:::5373212:4:::5371022:4:::5377504:4:::5126903:4:::5285637:4:::5362774:4:::5493497:4:::5388779:4:::5388779:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5490572:4:::5490572:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5240904:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Le Creuset 3 Piece Pan Set::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::06.02.2011::::    I am amazed that I have not yet written a review about my Le Creuset saucepan set.I have owned my Saucepans for about 4 years now. I bought them with some of the money that  I was left by my father when he died. The saucepans I had were not really very good ones and I knew how good le creuset were but had never bought any as they are very expensive the RRP for this set of saucepans is    240. I can not remember what price I paid for mine now but looking on line I see you can buy them for    184.95 from http://www.amazon.co.uk. My saucepans are orange they are also available in Graded Blue, Cerise, Granite, Almond, Teal, Satin Black I seem to remember That I would have preferred the green ones but they were more expensive at the time. The orange coloured saucepans have been around for many years I believe orange is the first colour that Le Creuset saucepans were made in.The 3 pans in my set are 16 cm, 18 cm, 20 cm this is a good range of sizes. I rarely use the 16 cm one but use the other two several times a week.  These Le Creuset pans are made of enamelled cast iron they are quite heavy in comparison to stainless steel pans.  Be carefull you do not drop one on your foot , ouch.  The base is flat. The lip of the saucepans is designed to make pouring from the left or right side easy. There is a little area    assist handle    to grip opposite the long black phenolic handle. The end of the handle is stainless steel I think ( its metal and silver coloured) this has a hole so that the saucepans can be  hooked up. The lids all fit well and have a black phenolic handle in the centre there is a stream vent in the lid. These pans are suitable for gas or electric being so heavy they take quite a time to heat through also quite a time to cool down. They are ideal for use on low or medium heat settings These pans are easy to use and easy to clean do not use abrasive scourers on them though. They are dishwasher safe.   I am very pleased with my Le Creuset pans. They are easy to use and are still in very good condition. They have a lifetime guarantee on them.Le Creuset began in France in 1925 by two Belgian industrialists Armand Desaegher and Octave Aubecq. The first orange pan was made in 1932.I really like using my pans and I do expect they will last my lifetime. Yes I would recommend them.     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5816422:3:::6750576:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6820455:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5439461:3:::5719918:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6800944:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6218348:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::5255134:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6292077:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6723034:4:::6826738:4:::6840580:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6805327:4:::6805327:4:::6310942:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6866291:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It did not take long for my grandson to tear open the wrapping from the box which contained the Lego city truck 3221.  This is a long bright yellow lorry almost 15 quot; quot; (39cm) long when constructed.After opening some more presents he eagerly set to making the truck.The bricks are presented inside a rectangular cardboard box we saved the box to put the bricks back in later. There are 278 bricks in this set to make the truck.   The bricks came in 3 numbered plastic bags, one for the truck and trailer one for the cab, one for the base.I think this is a good idea as a child can complete one part and then  come back later to make another part finding the pieces easier than if they were all in one bag.My grandson aged eight did not have any help to make the truck. I can not remember how long it took him to build it all, but I do remember he was totally absorbed for a long time, an hour or two. My granddaughter aged 5 also likes making some Lego buildings but this is beyond her really it   s too fiddly and would take her too long to make unaided. Lego say it is suitable for 5-12 year olds. Some of the pieces are very small so not ideal if your child does put things in their mouths still.There is a good step by step instruction leaflet in colour included. My 8 year old did not need any help following it.When completed the truck looks a realistic copy of a truck, it has headlights, wing mirrors  opening doors a cab river, a person with a hard hat to load and unload the goods , a sack truck to transport the 9 boxes which have to be made from the blue Lego bricks supplied.  These have pictures of Lego products on them. There is a lot of detail to make this realistic.Once made this lorry was played with by my grandson the wheels go round so he could push it my grandson enjoyed loading the blue boxes and putting them on the sack truck and helping the Lego person move them. I think it   s good that the truck comes with 2 people makes for more play opportunities. The cab has a bed in it and a flat screened T V for the driver when he parks up for his nights sleep on a long journey. This lorry  is played with by my grandson both as an individual item or as part of a scene with his other Lego toys. This Lego truck rarely gets completely taken to pieces and remade. It does however need repairing sometimes as the wheels come off if it gets driven too fiercely and sometimes a few of the other bricks come adrift. This truck is good for children to practice their building skills, their hand eye coordination their skills on following instructions, creativity and imaginary play. Lego bricks have been available for many years. In 1949 the first Lego brick proto type was made in Denmark by Ole Kirk Christansen whose company produced wooden toys. The name Lego comes from the Danish for play well.Lego brick have developed since then new models coming out often. Lego bricks make real life models of many things. A family member might be a lorry driver or you may have things arriving by lorry playing with this Lego lorry pretending to be the driver will help your child make sense of the real world.

       " '5247778::::Mattel Scrabble Original::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::02.02.2011::::    I may not technically be reviewing the original Scrabble as that was one made in 1948. However I am reviewing the scrabble that I own it is called Scrabble original, I have owned my game since the 1980   s.In 1931 a man called Alfred Butts developed a game called Lexico this he developed over the years and eventually in 1938 it had changed into a game he called Criss-Crosswords. Sadly for him he had little success marketing it. In 1948 James Brunot bought the manufacturing rights and paid Butts royalty on each game he sold. The game changes slightly and was renamed Scrabble. Since 1955 this game has been produced by Spears now part of the Mattel group.Scrabble is a game for 2 to 4 players it comes in a dark green box it is quite a sturdy box. Opening my box I find an instruction booklet, a scrabble board folded in half 35cmx35. The outer surface of this is a dark green.  Opening the board the playing side has a grid of 15x15 squares. The standard squares are green. Some squares are marked as    premium    squares and have double letter points(blue) or triple letter points(dark blue) or  double word  score(pink) or triple word score    red    The centre square is pink with a black star.Removing the playing board I find a preformed plastic tray holding 4, 17.5 cm dark green hard plastic tile racks, a green fabric bag with a drawstring for shuffling the letters, underneath this bag there are 100 ivory coloured plastic letter tiles about 2 cm square, 98 of these are letters 2 are blanks.Each letter tile has a point number value printed on it small. The points are 1-10. The more commonly used easy to place letters have a lower point value , the harder to place less frequent letters have a higher point value 2 tiles are blank and can be used as  any letter but have no point value.There is also a paper score pad in the box. Before we play we put the letters in the bag and each take a tile rack.We decide who goes first by each choosing (without looking) a tile from the green bag, the one with the letter nearest the beginning of the alphabet goes first. Each player dips into the bag without looking and takes 7 letter tiles. No cheating by looking at opponent   s letters.  The game is then played by taking turns to make words with their letters, see the full rules go to http://www.scrabblepages.com/scrabble/rules/.  The game finishes when either all the tiles are laid or you can not lay any more words. The first person makes a word from their tiles and lays it over the centre tile adding up the points and doubling them.This game is suitable for over 8 year olds. There are junior scrabble games available for the younger players. I think this game ideal for any one, teenagers and adults  My first recollection of playing this is when I was 17 really with my boyfriend (now hubby) and his grand parents. When at college I lived in a house with 6 other students and we played scrabble competively together keeping an on running total of games won. It was amazing what new? unheard of words  some tried to  lay and claim as real words.We occasionally visit or are visited by one of our friends from those days and we sometimes get the scrabble board out and revisit those competitive days, only difference now is we can afford wine to drink while we are playing and play by strong light instead of the glimmer from the gas fire.My husband and I will occasionally, may be once or twice a month play this game, we play it more often in the winter than summer. We used to play it occasionally with our daughter while she was at home still. Our game is still in quite good condition and I expect it to last several more years Scrabble is a good game to keep, or get those brain cells working. You can play on line just type in Scrabble on line to your search there are several sites, play either against computers or others. There are serious Scrabble players who play national scrabble competitions.I  am not up to national strandards but enjoy an occasional game with hubby or friends.     ::::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6845486:4:::6757811:4:::6506577:4:::6826738:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5255134:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6723034:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6218348:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6818102:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6873980:4:::6873980:4:::6691451:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Silver Spoon Icing Sugar::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::30.01.2011::::    Puts the Icing on a cake.Silver spoon is the British sugar corporation   s retail brand and is the logo on many sugar products. I just recently made and iced a cake the icing sugar was Silver spoon.I bought my box of 500g from Tesco where it costs 80p it   s the same price in Sainsbury   s and at Asda too. You can also get it in 1kg, 2kg, 3kg packs too. The box has a pink  picture on it  some birds flyingthrough a spoon forest and has the Silverspoon trademark spoon on it the bowl of the spoon is blue with white writing in it. Inside the box the icing sugar is in a white paper bag.I tear open the bag and spoon some icing sugar into a bowl. The sugar is soft a fine powder. Touch it, it feels silky smooth.Sometimes when I have made cakes or biscuits all it needs is a dusting of icing sugar to make it look more attractive. I get a fine sieve over the cake and put some icing sugar in it and tap the sieve and the icing sugar sprinkles fine on to the cake like a fine dusting of snow. If I am  making some fairy cakes or want to sandwich a Victoria sponge then I make butter icing  by  creaming 50g/2oz Softened Butter and 100g/4oz Icing Sugar sometimes I will add a drop or two of colouring to the butter cream or add some flavouring a few drops of vanilla or some orange I even add some chocolate powder to it too sometimes. Butter cream/icing takes a while to blend by hand you could use an electric whish depends on how much I am making what I do.Standard icing requires 100g (4oz) icing sugar     sieved 15ml spoon (1tbsp)  water this is enough to cover a 18 cm cake. Just mix the icing sugar and water together in a bowl add colouring or flavouring if required, add more icing sugar if it   s a bit thin and runny.This recipe is sufficient to cover 18cm cake.I expect I shall be making a birthday cake soon for my granddaughter and icing it with Silverspoon icing sugar, not sure what design  cake to make yet but I am sure it will be iced.Some of the first sweets I made as a child were peppermint creams using 275g (10oz) Icing Sugar, Egg White, large Peppermint Flavouring, Green Food Colouring. There are several recipes for using Silver spoon icing sugar at http://www.silverspoon.co.uk/home/recipesThere are 396 kcal per 100g in icing sugar. I think this icing sugar is made from sugar beet sugar the BSC silver spoon uses mainly beet sugar, it is finely powdered grinded white sugar. Sugar beet is grown a lot in East Anglia. There used to be a factory near Peterborough which processed sugar beet and at certain times of the year it really stank when it was working. I know this as I lived there for a few years. I think this factory shut down now. You could also use icing sugar to teach your child about dissolving, try it in cold water first   then in hot water which makes the icing sugar dissolve quickest? You could also make some fizzing sherbet  by using 50g icing sugar teaspoon bicarbonate of soda teaspoon citric acidLollipop or liquorice stick to dip., or make fizzy drinks using    a similar mixture  the recipe is online. http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sots/activities/itsagas.htmSilverspoon web site is  http://www.silverspoon.co.uk/home/products/sugar-and-syrups-for-cooking/icing-sugarIf you do not use the whole packet of icing sugar at once keep it in a dry place sealed in a storage jar is a good idea as it does pick up flavours     ::::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6742205:4:::6742205:4:::6723034:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6872438:4:::6872438:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5255134:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5279678:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6758309:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6845486:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6609678:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6506577:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5347743:4:::6818102:4:::6691451:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5203100:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6866291:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6826738:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6750576:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6810361:5:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Summer Fresh Concentrated Fabric Conditioner::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::23.01.2011::::    I like the smell of summer, grass, trees, sunshine, I do not like the winter dark wet and grey. I thought I would try the Tesco summer fresh conditioner to see if it would make my washing smell summery. The picture here on  Ciao and also on dooyoo is the same as the one on the Tesco site. However my summer fresh conditioner is yellow. I also have a spring fresh conditioner which is blue How ever I can not find it on the website. I am not sure when I bought my bottle of fabric conditioner but it was not more than a couple of months ago. This summer fresh conditioner is available in 2 sizes 750 ml, 21 washes or 1.5 ml 42 washes. The 750 bottle costs    102p/13.6 per ml. The 1.5L costs    1.93/   12.9a ml. These are in slightly different shaped bottles the larger one more straight sided. The cap on my transparent plastic bottle is yellow colour coordinated to the yellow liquid inside. The plastic yellow label wraps all around the centre of the bottle and has pictures of yellow summery flowers. I have my bottle here beside me and I just unscrewed the cap and yes it does smell pleasant a bit of a concentrated smell straight from the bottle. It is light floral smell with a hint of vanilla I think a bit ice creamy. This is a concentrated product which I like as it saves packaging materials also its less bulky to carry home, a better size for storage too.. I use about     a cap full maybe a little more of conditioner in my washes when I use it. Recommended dose is 35 ml per standard load, a full cap is 36 ml. The dosing instructions are on the side of the label. It warns do not pour conditioner straight onto fabric but to dilute first. I used this conditioner when I washed something s including a sheet this morning and I have just sniffed them and the fragrance has lingered the smell will fade away and I will not be really aware of it tomorrow. (This is not the first time that I have used this conditioner) The clothes feel quite soft after I use this conditioner. I like my towels after I have used a fabric conditioner, much nicer after a shower or bath. Also it is good to have soft socks and jumpers. I dislike ironing I do not think this conditioner makes it much easier, more pleasant maybe as the clothes smell nice. This fabric conditioner is fine for my skin but them I do not have sensitive skin, I know my grandson with excma is sensitive to a lot of fabric conditioner s, I do not know how he reacts to this one. When I have used all the summer fresh fabric conditioner I shall put the empty bottle in the recycling bin, Will I buy this one again? Yes      ::::6824827:3:::6824827:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6691451:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::5347743:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5335750:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5752942:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6723034:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5790028:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6657747:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6866291:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6843355:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6818102:4:::6826738:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6864027:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Slotted Spoon::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::22.01.2011::::    I have a Tesco value slotted spoon, I have owned it for a couple of years now, This spoon only costs about 40-50p I could not find it on line except at eBay where someone is selling 10 for    2.99. However I am sure I have seen it in the kitchenware department of a large Tesco   s. This slotted spoon is also available as one of the Tesco Value 21 Piece Non Stick Starter Set which costs    18. This spoon is made out of plastic it is completely black. This spoon is the standard length of most other kitchen utensils like this it is 32 cm long. The bowl of the spoon is 10 cm long it is 6.1/2 cm wide at the widest point. The 22 cm long 1.1/2 cm wide handle is wider at the top where you hold it. The bowl of the spoon has 8 narrow slots in it. If I am serving pasta or peas the water drains through these holes but not the food. However these holes are too big for rice grains. On this wider portion there is a small roughened indentation where my thumb goes when I hold this spoon, this gives extra grip on the utensil. At the end of the handle there is a hole where you can hang this straining spoon on a hook if you wish Although I do not own a dishwasher Tesco says it is fine to wash in a dish washer. I wash mine in hot water and washing up liquid.Overall I am satisfied with my value slotted spoon. I use it quite a lot to drain vegetables, as I said mine is a couple of years old and I have just examined it and see little wear on it I anticipate that it will last me a few more years.This slotted spoon would be ideal for use in sensory play activities for your child. I have worked in child care with special and non special needs children and a slotted spoon in great in water play children fish bricks and water play items from the water tray. Also these slotted spoons are good for dry sensory play sieving sand through it. Or get a bowl of oats and a few spoons and your child can sieve the oats through the holes. Your children can experiment with many things and see what will and will not  fall through the slotted holes , discuss size while doing this  too big too small.Yes my grandchildren have played with my slotted spoon sometimes when visiting I have  given them my out of date  oats to play with when they were 2  or 3 years old . However I do mostly use it for straining food.       ::::6421517:3:::6421517:3:::5816422:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6723034:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6869626:4:::6869626:4:::6866291:4:::6850650:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6826738:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6818102:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6689426:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5702150:5:::5702150:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Baco Bacofoil Disposable Portion Trays::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::19.01.2011::::    BacoFoil 6 Small Portion Trays with LidsI sometimes use these Baco foil small portion trays to cook extra meals in freeze for a work night supper, I also use some Pyrex dishes for the same purpose. I used these  foil trays to freeze food in rather than buying more Pyrex type dishes as  empty they are easier to store in the cupbourd as they nest inside each other. They are a uniform size so fit into my freezer easily. I often make a casserole or spaghetti Bolognese, ideal for a lasagne or perhaps I will make an apple crumble or a treacle pudding. I deliberately prepare too much and if it   s a crumble or sponge pudding cook some in this small foil tray. If it   s a casserole I will cook it in a huge Pyrex dish that I have and place a portion in a Baco foil tray. When my daughter was at uni I often did what we called jokingly a food run, when we visited her or she came back home for a visit. I would prepare some foods in these foil trays for her to freeze in her flats freezer for when she was too ill to cook for herself (she suffered with chronic fatigue syndrome (M E) or too hard up to buy a meal. In the last few years of my Dads life I also used to do the same for him.   These foil trays can be used to cook food in the oven. They are not suitable for use in the microwave, however if I want to microwave the food that they contain I empty the food from the foil tray and put it in a container that I can microwave.These small portion trays measure approximately 13cm x 10.3cm x 4.1cm. it is a good depth.I find this a fair size for a single portion of a casserole with everything included potatoes in it, or it   s a good size for two if it contains a shepherd   s pie. If it contains a crumble or a sponge pudding then there is a very good portion for 2 or 3 people.There are 6 of these small foil trays in a pack that is wrapped together with plastic. They each have a foil covered card lid which fits well. The lip at the top of the foil tray is folded back so you can fold this over the lid to make a seal when storing or freezing the product. These foil trays from Baco foil are a good product the foil is strong. Then after use I wash mine and reuse them. I do this several times with the same tray making them more cost effective. They can of course be put in the foil recycling collection. However to save washing up you could just throw them away.I just checked on line and a pack of 5 small portion Bacofoil trays cost    1.75 (29.2p) each in Sainsburies or    1.83 (31p ) each in Waitrose.   Baco foil make other different sized trays too.

       " '5247778::::Henry Goodes Soft Liquorice::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::17.09.2010::::    Henry Goodes soft liquorice comes from Pontefract so I am led to believe.  It is made by Tangerine confectionary. My husband knows how much I love liquorice so when he went to our local corner shop he bought me a bag. This cost him 59 p. I know this because the price is written in black in a black rimmed red circle on the brown paper bag. On the bag there is a picture of a balding man with a moustache wearing a bow tie and white shirt, he has a union jack apron on. In his hand he is holding and presenting an oval tray of sticks of liquorice. I tore open the bag and found little sticks of black liquorice about 3cm long and 1cm fat. Picking one out of the bag I could feel it was very soft, I could squeeze it.   Because I was just idly fiddling with the last     cm of this liquorice in my hand I have discovered I can roll it into a ball. Putting the liquorice stick between my teeth I took a bite it was very soft an easy bite. I chewed and savoured the flavour it was lovely a mild liquorice taste, sweet and very pleasant, and yes it does make your tongue go a little bit black.  I shall certainly buy some another time. I will not tell you the complete contents enough to say it does contain wheat and is Halal approved suitable for vegetarians. I doubt you would eat 100g at a time but there are 353 kcal per g.  Very low fat under 2 I read on the http://www.tangerineuk.net that this liquorice is the only British soft-eating one on the market. This soft liquorice has only been available about a year and has won a Gold l award in the national Food and Drink Awards, run by grocery trade publication The Grocer. This Henry Goodes soft liquorice comes in a 300g bag too you can buy this bigger bag in Tesco   s and Sainsbury   s for    1.78 or at Asda for    1.97, 2 bags for    2      ::::3957:3:::6860710:3:::6860710:3:::5646482:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6750576:3:::6701923:3:::6834688:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6657747:3:::5719918:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6818102:4:::5335750:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6800944:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6858582:4:::6858582:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6856387:4:::6856387:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6771611:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Monument Coombe Hill, Wendover::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::10.01.2011::::    There is a monument at the top of Coombe hill, I first walked up the hill to it in 1977, I lived in the village of Wendover below this hill. I have now moved away from this village, not far about 7 miles and frequently visit   to walk the hills. The monument has had scaffolding around it and has been recently refurbished this is what inspired me to write the review.*Location. Coombe hill is on the edge of Wendover it is in Buckinghamshire 7k from Aylesbury, map OS Explorer Map No. 181.  map reference SP 869079 . You can get to Wendover by train from London or Aylesbury walk up the road a little then up the wooded hill then on to the grassy top to the monument, or you can park by the golf course at Butlers cross (difficult) and walk up the hill from there. However, if you do not want to do much walking up hills, park in the small car park. This car park you will find on the road to Dunsmore that leaves the Missenden road a short distance away from Butlers cross. The Ridgeway path goes alongside this car park and through the woods down Coombe hill. Coombe hill is the highest viewpoint in the Chilterns.* The monument stands proud at the top of Coombe Hill in a grassy area. The monument is 64 foot tall a solid structure.This monument can be seen from quite a distance. From the monument you get good views across the vale of Aylesbury. Also you can just see Chequers in the woods only perhaps a mile away. Look at the little dots of cars you never know one might be a government car. A reasonable amount of air traffic can be seen from this point, some from local RAF Halton, some Luton, Gatwick, and Heathrow some of the helicopters might be visitors to Chequers. Standing by the monument is a good viewpoint the colours of the countryside and the blue sky making a lovely scene. The original monument itself was erected in 1904 to   honour the memory of the 148 Buckinghamshire men who died during the  second Boer war 1899 to 1902. This was destroyed by lightning and rebuilt that same year. However the monument had weathered, eroded and needed work doing on it. So until recently the monument has had scaffolding around it. A new plaque on the monument inscribed with the names of the Buckinghamshire men has been fitted. I am glad there is a mini picture of this monument on this page as I find it hard to describe this solid looking monument. A tower thrusting up into the sky with a plaque with lists of soldiers, a Buckinghamshire crest too. Several ledges at the bottom like steps, these are great to sit on and rest awhile. Then a small flat area and 4 short pillars one in each corner.   Copy and paste the below you   re your computer and you will see many pictures of the monument http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=coombe+hill+monument. Coombe Hill is owned by the National Trust but the monument is owned by the Council. So why not come take a walk and view the monument, Coombe hill is a good wildlife area with plenty of fauna and flora on the chalk soil. With a bit of luck you might see a Red Kite bird these have become more common in the Chilterns recently after an introduction a few years back.      ::::5816422:3:::5808829:3:::6750576:3:::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6786865:4:::6800944:4:::6145850:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::3957:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6843355:4:::6843584:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6868105:4:::6868105:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6840580:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6836599:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6749875:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6866291:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6830048:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5203100:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6691451:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

They produce a lot of sugar products including chocolate chips. I recently made some fairy cakes with some of these chocolate chips in. I tend to use an own brand of chocolate chips but hubby was shopping. These cost hubby 73p they also cost 73p at Sainsbury   s. I notice DR Oetker chocolate chips cost    1.15 for the same size 100 gram packet. These chocolate chips are presented in a blue plastic packet which has a silver spoon centre front this is the logo of the company. It is best to cut open this packet in the corner  not too big a  hole or  all of the contents might get spilt , I prefer to buy my  chocolate chips in a  plastic tub I spill and waste less.Opening the packet I could not resist I had to try a chocolate chip. It smelt chocolaty, It tasted a good milk chocolate did not have that cooking chocolate taste. I looked at it brown and circular about     a cm in diameter at the most. Now I was ready I had some cake mix  a basic  one 112g/4oz sugar x 112g/4oz  margarine, 2 eggs x 112g/ 4oz flour. My granddaughter was helping me so she stirred them in. We added the complete contents of the packet minus two or three chocolate chips that went in my grand daughter   s tummy. There were   plenty of chocolate chips for this quantity, you could get away with less chips or a slightly bigger quantity of cake mix. After these cakes were cooked we had to eat them, they tasted good the chocolate chips enhanced the cake.Taking a bite of the plain cake and finding a scrummy yummy choc chip in my mouth.  I stopped at one choc chip cake my grandchildren ate two each and some went home with them. These chocolate chips would be good to add to any cake biscuit that needs chocolate chips added. They are good at holding their shape. These chocolate chips are not suitable for   people who are dairy intolerant, they contain 529 kcal per 100g. These chocolate chips are also good for early science teaching your children about changes and melting.      ::::5335750:3:::6869626:3:::6869626:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6824827:3:::6824827:3:::5951201:3:::5951201:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6469822:4:::6469822:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6843355:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::5414290:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6816341:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6845486:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6657747:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6866291:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5719918:4:::6844462:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The ingredients for these biscuits are approved organic ingredients. Although these biscuits are nut free the factory handles nut ingredients. They also contain wheat, gluten and milk. They are suitable for vegetarians. These biscuits are an attractive oval shape fairly thick. They are a lovely golden brown colour. . A very simple biscuit with R  W imprinted large in the centre of the surface of the biscuit. Both the biscuit and the box have that wholesome look about it.The biscuits are not as very crumbly biscuit they do not fall to pieces.Thet smell sweet and of caramel. These biscuits taste good you would have to like toffee caramel to like them though. They do have quite strong caramel flavour, that lightly burnt sugar taste. It is a very sweet taste. It is a strong taste I could not eat many at the same time. I had never had these before and I did quite like them, I am not sure I will be rushing out to buy more. I might if I were buying biscuits for when we have guests. Hubbt did not like them . When I asked  him what he thought the flavour was he said coffee ?I think these biscuits were bought in Tesco   s where they cost    1.99 for a packet.

       " '5247778::::Thorntons  orange slices covered in dark  chocolate::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.01.2011::::     Thorntons dark chocolate orange  slices. requested I received a packet of these as a Christmas gift   I thought they were very tasty. I am not sure where these were bought as several shops sell Thornton   s sweets and at a range of prices. However on the Thornton   s web site it gives the price as    3.99 reduced from    4.99. I think that   s quite expensive but then chocolate is.These chocolates are presented in a card sachet. The box is orange with some white tree designs on it.  The chocolate slices are contained in a foil packet in this carton .There are 214g of these slices in the box I love dark chocolate and oranges. I opened these and took one out. The chocolate is like a thin slice of a segment semi circular. The chocolate covering this orange is a good dark chocolate taste it covers a thin orange slice.They smell pleasant chocolate with a hint of orangeBiting into this sweet the chocolate is not so thin that it cracks and falls off. So each bite contains chocolate and a piece of orange. The orange is slightly chewy. The taste very pleasant the orange taste is not really very strong, just a delicate flavour. The chocolate and the orange taste do go well together. I do not find the flavour over sweet, not as sweet as the Terry   s chocolate orange. I think that a few of these would go down well with the after meal coffee instead of an after eight mint     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6737834:3:::6737834:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::3957:3:::6825635:3:::6825635:3:::5247678:3:::5247678:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6864647:3:::6864647:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5816422:3:::6609304:3:::6609304:3:::6836599:3:::5203100:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::5786498:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6805327:3:::6805327:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6552833:3:::6552833:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::6390014:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6448877:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6826738:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6866291:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6845486:4:::6830048:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Star Wars Mini Figures Magnets Set - Yoda, Count Dooku & Mace Windu ..::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.01.2011::::    Several times this week I have had the fun of playing with Yoda, Count Dooku   Mace Windu. These 3 figures are in the form of a mini magnet set I bought for my grandson. These figures are really essential if you are a star wars fan. My grandson was also receiving the Lego star wars shuttle as a gift and these figures complement it, give added play value.My grandson is 8 these figures are suitable for a child over 6 years old.Each mini figure comes with a grey eight stud magnet brick that has a grey flat plastic piece attached this will act as a back support for the mini figures. Each figure also has his own light sabre.Each figure is about 4.1/2 cm /1.3/4 inches tall. Yoda is a little shorter than the others. After my grandson had taken off the Christmas wrapping paper we had wrapped his gift (just what I asked Santa for he said) he found  the three mini figures on a long card that had a clear plastic wrapping we could see the mini figures fronts through this. The pack was not ever so easy to rip open, I cut one corner so my grandson could open it. All the figures were removed and examined. ^^Yoda^^Yoda as all the other figures fits and is easily removed from the grey magnetic brick stand unfortunately this brick does not have indentations for fitting it onto other bricks it is flat. However the figures fit to other pieces of Lego as well as this magnetic brick. Yoda looks like his character in the star wars film he is quite detailed.  Yoda   s legs are not moveable at his waist the legs of the other characters are. Yoda   s arms will move though and he has those Lego claw like hands. His hands are green they are made of a rubbery substance. Yoda   s green head with his white eyes with black pupil   s pointy ears is also made of that soft rubbery material. I wondered if the ears will get damaged. The rest of Yoda is that hard Lego brick plastic. He grips his green light sabre well he could hold one of the other light sabres equally as well. I do quite like this mini figure except the rubbery head /hands feels strange.^^ Count Dooku ^^Now he looks a nasty character one I would not like to meet on a dark night. He holds a red light sabre in his hard plastic claw hands. His arms move up and down so he can wave his light sabre in the air.Count Dooku has moveable legs, they both move together from the waist. Count Dooku is all dressed in black he has a black cape. He looks like the fictional character with his grey hair and beard and dark black eyes. ^^Mace Windu^^Now he is the figure dressed in brown that has black markings on it. He has a purple light sabre grasped in his claw hand. Mace Windu is the same height as Count Dooku. His arms and legs move in the same way. The top of Mace Windu   s head has a leggo    pip    on it so you could stick another brick on it.These figures when fitted onto the  magnetic brick stand can all be fixed to  your fridge, or other magnetic surface, until they are need to fly a space ship or to battle.My grandson and I built the shuttle he has then the figures   flew in it then they fought together with thier light sabres.My grandson chortles as he helped Count Dooku kill, Yoda however Yoda came back to life and hid behind the space shuttle.I can see my grandson happily playing with these figures for hours. I expect he will probably play with these until his teens.*I think these figures would make a great birthday cake topper for a Star wars fan.  I bought these figures at http://.lego.com where they cost    8.99 however Amazons cheapest price is    18.29 at eBay they are    13.48. I hope my grandson looks after these figures as I have a feeling that they might be a collectable of the future.May the force be with you     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6691451:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6786865:4:::6748799:4:::6748799:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6845486:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5347743:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5203100:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Glitter Shakers::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::02.01.2011::::    I have been shaking and creating some Christmas art work with the children using glitter from the pack of 6 glitter shakers I recently bought from The Works shop in town. 6 small clear pots containing coloured glitter were available. I seem to remember they cost me    1.20. Each pot contains about 10g of coloured glitter. The colours are red, purple, blue, green, silver and gold ideal Christmas colours. The shaker tubs that the glitter comes in are wider and shorter (3cmx5cm) than some which makes them more stable when they are placed on the table. To get into the glitter the red cap is easily screwed of if you wish to shake the glitter out then remove the circular card disc, do keep this dish and replace after using the glitter. The red plastic cap is perforated like a pepper pot. When shaken the glitter comes out of these holes quite well, nearly but not quite too well. I like this shaker option as it did restrict the glitter mess we made. I found the red cap stayed on well while the children were shaking, the cap did not fall of and cause the glitter to get everywhere. We had made Christmas tree and stained church window cards and some glue stick and some PVA childrens glue was used and the glitter stuck well on both these glues. We did have to shake the card when the glitter was on it and tipped it up over a plain piece of paper the glitter that did not stick to the glue was then used again. These pots of glitter are recommended for 3 year olds and over. The 5 year olds that I used these with had fun some needing more supervision than others. My Grandson aged 8 and my granddaughter 5 also enjoyed using these glitter shakers. The glitter effects that were produced on their cards using this were good the colour range excellent. Yes I would recommend this glitter for an art project using glitter The pots I used were the same size and shape as these ones but there were 6 pots in a pack and they had red lids. Sorry I tried and failed to add a picture of my pots here, I think ciao is hasving a problem with the photo links     ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::6869626:4:::6869626:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6506577:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5816422:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5347743:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6758309:4:::5719918:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6840580:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6866291:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Thinsulate Winter Beanie::::Sports & Outdoors::::50::::very helpful::::01.01.2011::::    A couple of days ago I wore the black Thinsulate hat that I bought last year on an Aylesbury market stall. I paid about    2.00 for mine I was doing some work cutting down hawthorn.  My hat is identical to the one in the picture here. However I do know that you can buy other styles and colours of thinsulate hat   s from other manufacturers. Matalan sell a hat glove and scarf set for    5,.  I suspect from the picture that it   s the same the hat Regatta sell a thinsulate hat (TRC320) in black or blue for    2.64, they also produce a slightly different thinsulate hat R R P    4.99. I saw one recently for    2.99 in a sale. Peter storm sell one for    5.99. Marks and Spencer   s also sell a different thinsulate hat it cost    7 the Marks and Spencer hat   is a knitted hat has not the smooth fleece look. I have seen thinsulate hats in black, grey, 2 shades of blue, plum, yellow, white or red. However although I have seen other people wearing most of these other thinsulate hats and I have had and worn other  fleece hats I shall talk about the thinsulate hat that I have which I think is identical to the one in the picture.The thinsulate hat which I wear is one size the fabric slightly stretchy so would suit either male or female heads. It is a beanie style hat which you pull on it covers the head closely and snugly. There is no back or front to the hat it is the same shape all round. There is a turn up this is good as it gives double thickness over the ears There is a small label sewn on the brim which says thinsulate insulation. At the top of my hat there is a small loop of the thinsulate  fabric sometimes hang my hat on a peg with this loop, my husband loves making fun of me and will sometimes  grasp the loop and pull my hat of my head easily , grrrrr.Although I do not think this beanie style of thinsulate hat is the most attractive, I do wear my hat a lot in the colder weather. I wear my hat on the playground,  I wear it when I go for a walk  I  made sure I wore my hat when playing in the snow with the children, I have even worn it when out shopping . However I would not wear it for a wedding. Neither have I worn it when near a bonfire, as I have another fleece hat that I wore once and sparks fell on it and melted the fabric so I have tiny holes in it, if it   s cold and I am making a bonfire then I wear the damaged hat.This hat really does keep my head and ears warm, I do not get overheated in it. My head feels snug and warm in the snow and the wind with this hat on. My thinsulate hat does not fall of my head it fits so well, I could shake my head and it not come off. This thinsulate hat is soft and comfortable to wear.This thinsulate hat is not a very thick, heavy, bulky hat the fabric. The name is made up of two words thin and insulate. It is as the name suggests a thin fabric 3 mm I think. When I take it off outside it easily goes into a coat/jacket pocket. The fabric is polyester. Why this polyester is so warm even though not a thick hat is because the micro fibres that the hat is made of are very fine they trap more air than thicker fibres. This trapped air makes good insulation from the outside coldI have dropped my hat in a muddy puddle its dirty , This hat washes well in a washing machine at 30 , the label says hand wash, the label says not to spin or tumble dry. I have dried mine over the radiator it dries fairly quickly. The label says not to iron It does not need ironing anyway. If you have a thinsulate hat do read the wash instructions some may say hand wash only others machine washable. I shall continue to wash mine at a low temperature and not tumble it I hope this will prolong its life, saying that I expect this hat to last several years anyway. So would I recommend a thinsulate beanie style hat in this cold weather? YES     ::::5633146:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6866291:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::5719918:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6843355:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6826738:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6870095:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::5971856:4:::5971856:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6845486:4:::6843584:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6840580:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5816422:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6864027:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Whole Milk::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::31.12.2010::::    Its just after Christmas and I have  half bottles of several varieties  of milk I have oatly  for my dairy intolerant grandson I have skimmed cows milk and I have some whole full fat  cows milk too for my granddaughters Christmas breakfast cereal .  I bought all these milks at Tesco. I shall continue to tell you about the Tesco whole milk. This milk comes in translucent white plastic bottles each with a little handle on for easy gripping and pouring. The whole milk has a blue cap that you twist and remove.  Tesco sells whole milk in pint  (568ml), 2 pint,( 1.14L) 4 pint (2.27L) or 6 pint (3.41L)  bottles I  have found the 6 pint bottle to be huge a bit un wieldy however I only bought the 1 pint size. The price of this milk is 45p for 1 pint. 86 for 2 pints 4 pints    1.55,     2.17 for 6 pints The prices are the same in the Sainsbury   s, Ocado  and  Asda, for the 1 and 2 pints however the 4 pints of milk is    1.25 at Asda, 6 pints is  only    1.85 at Asda and    2.00 at Sainsbury   s and Ocado. When I was growing up I seem to remember we only had the option of whole milk or the gold cap creamier milk. Today most adults conscious of the fat in whole milk drink either semi or skimmed milk. However for a child over 12 months Whole milk is a good option  for those who are not breast feeding or  drinking formula milk a toddler needs fat and calories for growth and brain development . When a child is 2 you can give them semi skimmed milk or skimmed milk. The Tesco whole milk is pasteurized standardized homogenized whole milk.     I have made a tiny chart for you to compare calories and fat in different milksPer 100ml  Skimmed milk Semi skimmed Whole milk Energy                 kCal   34kCal 48kcal 64kcalFat    0.1g 1.6g 2.2gMilk is good for you it contains calcium for growing bones and for old bones too.* TasteI have had whole milk from these other providers at one time or another and I think they all taste pretty much the same as each other.Whole milk tastes much richer and creamier than skimmed milk, after drinking skimmed milk for a while I prefer skimmed milk in most foods. I really do not like full milk in my cup of tea. But I do like it when making custard.  Occasionally if drinking plain milk or having it on cereal then I like full fat milk.  I just had a childhood memory of my sister and I fighting over who would get the top of the milk. Fat rises so the top of the milk is creamier. Generally now I prefer skimmed or semi skimmed milk. I guess it   s the taste you get used to as when I started drinking skimmed milk instead of  whole milk It took me a while to get to like the taste. However whole milk can be used in the same recipes as skimmed milk  make a Yorkshire pudding or a rice pudding, with the whole milk you get a lot of skin on the top. Well the date on the milk in my fridge is still fine I bought it on the 24th and its fine till the 2nd January. So what shall I do with that drop of Tesco whole milk that I have left after Christmas?..........            I know I have some cocoa powder I shall make myself a cocoa chocolate drink it will be creamier than if I was to use skimmed milk.     ::::5719918:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6833802:4:::6833802:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6866291:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6816341:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5786498:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6844462:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6735325:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Bricks & Buckets: Lego Large Pink Brick Box 5560::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::28.12.2010::::    Lego Creative Building 5560 Pink Brick Box I think nearly every little girl must have had this Pink brick box for Christmas this year. My grand daughter received one from her other grandparents and I looked on line at Tesco and John Lewis to discover the price and find that both stores have sold out. The retail price both were    24.99. If you are really desperate to get this Pink box of Lego http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=5560  is in stock at    24.99 as well.My granddaughter is 5 in January this set of Lego is suitable for children over the age of 4. My granddaughter has some other Lego and has played with her brother   s huge collection since well before she was 4. This Pink box contains standard Lego sized pieces. Some of the pieces of this Lego are very small so it   s not suitable for children who still put everything in their mouths. Larger bricks like Duplo, quarto and baby also manufactured by Lego are larger and more suitable for younger children.My granddaughter was delighted to tear off the wrapping paper and find a large pink plastic tub measuring about 19.x 37.7 x 22 cm. This pink box has a well fitting see through plastic lid. This box is ideal storage and also means this Lego collection is easily transported between my house and my daughter   s house.When my granddaughter opened the tub I was surprised at how empty the box seemed. There are 402 bricks in the box, I did not count them but when you consider some of the bricks were only single pip size and when my granddaughter built the models then I estimated the number correct. Still the half empty pink storage box will be handy to put some of her other Lego in. The box is good as  it  is useful to  keep all the bricks tidied away its easy to pick the bricks of the floor and throw them into the box   Since this was describes as a large pink brick box I was expecting all the bricks in the box to be pink     I was relieved to discover that all of the bricks inside this box were not pink. There were a lot of pink brick   s three shades of pink in fact, then there were yellow brick   s, red brick   s, orange brick   s,  two shades of blue and two shades of green brick   s  a few brown brick   s and some grey brick   s. Included is one small building plate a couple of windows a door a horse and a mini figure. There were some wheels a tiny Lego brush, a golden cup, some flowers and some fences.In the top of the box as we opened it was an instruction booklet with patterns for building 6 items.My granddaughter looked at these and built the tree and the stable. She found the pattern   s easy enough to follow and self corrected her mistakes. While she copied the patterns faithfully I built a freestyle building. My grand daughter also had a present of some other Lego bases which I feel this set did need especially if more than one child is going to play with it. My granddaughter was kept occupied for ages with this Lego set of bricks and I am sure will have many happy hours playing with it in the future. I expect this Lego will provide entertainment for her for many years and then still be in good condition to be passed on or saved for the next generation. My grandchildren play with some of their mothers Lego which must be about 25 years old if not more, as when she grew out of it we saved it in the loft and then got it out for the grandchildren. All Lego needs to clean it when it gets dirty is a wash in warm soapy water.This Pink box of Lego which my granddaughter has  would make an ideal starter set , personally although I know pink is popular and my granddaughters favourite colour I cant help but cringe at the girly popularity of this colour and  would choose an alternate coloured box by preference a  similar one comes in blue and green I believe. However my granddaughter went all gooey over her Pink Lego,    wow its just what I wanted she said    Lego regardless of colour is a really good toy. Lego helps your child develop their creativity and their imagination. It lets your child practice and perfect their fine motor skill   s. Get a large amount of Lego and let your child play with it alongside their friends to learn about sharing and cooperative play. Lego can be used to help your child develop their language skills, identifying and naming colour   s, talking about size. Just in case Lego bricks have passed you by   Lego bricks are plastic interlocking bricks. The firm that manufactures them is a Danish one.  Lego has its roots in 1932 when carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen made wooden toys .In 1934 the company was called Lego which translated means play well. This company expanded and in 1949 was making plastic interlocking bricks. The bricks have developed over the years new ideas and bricks made and are played with by children everywhere.  From the enthusiasm and  time my granddaughter spent playing with this toy then yes I think this is a good gift for a girl (or boy) that likes pink.  This pink box of Lego bricks is suitable for home use but I think it would also be suitable for school.      ::::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5347743:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6691451:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6145850:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6757811:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6750576:4:::6855417:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6265842:5:::6265842:5:::5817960:5:::5817960:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Crayola 12 Half Length Coloured Pencils::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::24.12.2010::::     I have spent sometime while I have been snowed in sorting my stationary draw. I have some Crayola half size colour pencils, ones I bought for the grandkids I expect. I notice that Ryman are selling a pack of 12 for 69p instead of    1.49 Amazon are selling them for 88p a packet. Ryman does have several shops in a lot of towns so you could just pick a packet of these up for a stocking filler.Crayola make a wide variety of crayons and art materials. The products usually good these coloured pencils are a good one. In a pack of 12 you get a good range of colours red, red-orange, orange, yellow, yellow-green, green, sky blue, blue, violet, light brown, brown and black.  These colouring pencils are   suitable for a 3 year old and over. They are half the length of a standard pencil. I like the half sized pencil crayons for children as they will be less likely to poke them in their eyes. These half sized ones are easier to hold and control in a small hand. They are about 9 or 10 cm long.  The shaft of this Crayola colouring pencil is smooth and round. I have not known the wood splinter. These are not shaped pencils. Some children might need a pencil crayon with flat sides for easy grip but my grand children find the smooth circular ones easy to hold.  When the brightly coloured pack of pencils is opened all the pencils are ready sharpened. The    lead    of these pencils is strong they do not break easily. When they need sharpening it is easy with a standard pencil sharpener. a colouring in pencil will last a long time before its sharpened  too short and  is no good anymore.In a pack of 12 you get a good range of colours red, red-orange, orange, yellow, yellow-green, green, sky blue, blue, violet, light brown, brown and black.  The colours these produce on paper is good, strong, bright positive colours. These with a colouring book or a pad of paper are a good Christmas present as  they will give you a quiet moment or too  as no one can resist using a new  pencil on a clean page in a new book. Drawing or colouring writing with these crayola coloured pencils is a good activity your 3 + year old practicing their pencil  hold for writing, Practising their fine motor control, learning about colours .Your older more able child using them for colouring in, or creating their own pictures. Yes I would recommend Crayola colouring pencils      ::::6723241:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6757811:4:::6861853:4:::6861853:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6781956:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6855417:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6840580:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::5203100:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6842978:4:::6842978:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Jus Rol Ready Rolled Shortcrust Pastry::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::22.12.2010::::    ,Jus Rol Ready Rolled Shortcrust Pastry, I was feeling lazy and I wanted minimum of mess, I was going to bake an apple pie. I prefer shortcrust pastry to flaky or puff for my apple pie. So I took the packet of just roll shortcrust pastry out of my freezer and put it in the fridge the night before I was going to use it. This pastry should defrost overnight in the fridge or will take about 2     hours out of the fridge. I removed it from the fridge before I needed it so that the pastry warmed a little. I tear open the blue thin card packaging it is in and check it is ready to use by unrolling the pastry if it begins to crack then I give it a little longer. There are two circular sheets of pastry in this pack each measures approx 2 x 280mm. weight 450g so 225g each sheet. The two circular sheets of pastry are divided by a circular film of paper. I had my pie plate ready and gently positioned one circle of pastry on it, then put the filling in. I had prepared earlier I have a few quantities of apple precooked (by me) for pie fillings in my freezer.  I then put the other circle over the top, pricked a few holes in it glazed it with egg and milk and proceeded to cook it at just under 200 c. When I removed the pie from the oven the pastry looked good a golden colour it  smelt good too this pastry had  cooked well. When we ate some the pastry tasted good. This pastry has a good crumbly texture This pastry is suitable for vegetarians. As you might expect it has wheat flour vegetable oil in it.  There are 546 kcal per 100 g of this pastry when it is cooked. This pastry is available at Tesco, Morrison   s, Sainsbury   s and Ocado for the same price of    1.50 todayIt really is the cheat   s lazy way to make pastry no need even to roll this pastry out It is a good tasty pastry too, so if you are lacking of time to make your own, yes I would recommend this pastry. It can be used for many sweet or savory recipes. Just roll pastry is also available as puff, flaky or filo pastryJus Rol Ready Rolled Shortcrust Pastry,     ::::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::5816422:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5203100:3:::6868105:3:::6868105:3:::6825635:3:::6825635:3:::6797968:3:::6797968:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6750576:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6871240:4:::6871240:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6506577:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6190414:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6843380:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6771611:4:::6743530:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6866291:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5362774:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6830048:4:::6821514:5:::6821514:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Flair Pocket Etch a Sketch::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::19.12.2010::::     Over the years I have played with many etch a sketch toys one I recently played with is the mini pocket  sized one .  . This Etch a sketch only measures 9.5cm x 10.5cm. This toy is suitable for a child aged over 4.  I notice http://www.yellowmoon.org.uk are selling this toy for    6.99 it was    9.99. I think that   s a bit expensive for a small toy however this toy is quite durable. This toy is ideal to take in the car or on holiday with you it will provide entertainment for your child. This  pocket sized etch a sketch is a minature of the larger one it is red with the grey screen and has  those two white 4 round knobs on.  The knobs do stick out a bit so that the toy will not slip flat into a pocket. However the knobs on this etch a sketch although small are still easy to grasp and twiddle to make lines go up or across the screen to make a picture. Being a small screen I agree it is quite limiting to what you can draw and as with all etch a sketches you can not draw circles easily. It is possible to write  with this toy ideal for keeping a car game score on or collecting  number plate numbers. After your picture is complete and you want to draw a new design then just shake this toy and the lines will disappear. I have noticed though that often the lines on this mini one do not disappear completely. I think this mini etch a sketch fine for entertaining a child in the car for a while although I think  if you have the room a  bigger etch a sketch would be betterEtch a sketch was first  produced on 12th of July 1960 for nearly 51 years old this toy has been popular with many children. The basic toy is very similar to the   first one produced.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6860710:3:::6860710:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6654280:3:::6654280:3:::5816422:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5203100:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5439461:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6506577:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::3957:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6657747:4:::6859203:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6855417:4:::6860248:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6830048:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6866291:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6735325:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::My First UK Money Snap::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::17.12.2010::::    My first {UK} money snap is a pack of cards from the Green board game company. These cars in a green and yellow packet with  blue star like splodge on the front with the words UK money snap printed on  has a RRP of    4.  Amazon is selling it for    3.82. This pack of cards is suitable for children aged 5 and over. It   s suitable for key stage 1 and 2. My grandson aged 7 has had this pack for about a year I think it has helped him understand money. Understanding   the coins and their value.These cards are the same size as a standard pack of cards. The cards are not particularly thick they are quite thin. The cars have a different assortment of coins from 1p up to    2 printed on them. Although you can play snap with these cards it is not a simple matching game of snap. On one card two 5p pieces might be printed the match for this would be the 10p piece card, another match would be a card showing five 1 p pieces and one showing a 5 p piece. You could also play  a pairs game in the same way collecting pairs of cards that although have different  coins on them add up to the same , so  a card with two 50 p  pieces on  would be a pair for a  card with a pound on it ..There are also cards which have the monetary value written on in numerals like 50p or 10p, a pound or two pounds.   There is a guide included so your child cans self check the pairs.The green board company make several other educational snap card games, one colour and shape another a times table snap. These are good games to play with your child or with a group of children     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5817960:3:::5817960:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::6843584:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6843380:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6657747:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6506577:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5347743:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6859203:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6689426:4:::6474620:4:::6474620:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6691451:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6636701:4:::6636701:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6866291:4:::6845486:4:::6735325:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5362774:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Crate Of Cut & Play Fruit::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.12.2010::::    In 2005 I wrote a review on the crate of cut and play vegetables from the Early Learning Centre, this toy is still available today. Trawling through the categories to find something to write a new review on I find the Early Learning Centre crate of cut and play fruit. The fruit have also been available as long as the vegetables.This set of fruit is suitable for a child aged between 3 and 8 years old. The fruit ones that I use must be at least 3 years old and they are still in fair condition maybe a little faded but still good. The Velcro on some of them is a little worn. This is a durable toy. In 2005 these cost    10 now they cost    12. For your    12 you will get a green plastic crate. This crate is stackable with the crate that has plastic vegetables in it. There is also a plastic child safe knife and 12 fruits. The fruits include a bunch of grapes, an apple, a pear, a plum, an orange, a banana, a strawberry, a piece of melon, and a lemon.Each of these pieces of fruit is divided into 2 pieces some into 3 the cut sides fitted with Velcro so that they fit together.  The knife is a good size for children to hold and does help them practice their cutting skills safely.  I have used these both on the classroom table for children to practice their cutting skills and in the house corner for more pretend play.I have spent many occasions pretending to eat a piece of fruit that has been cut and presented to me. These fruits are useful for healthy eating topics and for familiarising children with the fruits, learning the names of the fruits. They are good for maths too, learning about halves as most of them do split into halves. Divide the fruit into   pieces and let the child find the correct pieces to make the complete fruit using their fine motor control to fit them together. This is a very durable toy suitable for both home and nursery. If this fruit does get dirty it is easy to clean by wiping with a damp cloth. Yes I would recommend this crate of cut and play fruit from the Early Learning Centre.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5347743:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6190414:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6689426:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6657747:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6859203:4:::6636701:4:::6636701:4:::6292077:4:::5203100:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6735325:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5362774:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Green's Scooby Doo cookie Mix::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::12.12.2010::::    My grandson actually received this as a birthday gift. When they came to visit me my daughter asked did I want to cook with them and gave me this kit to use. I have not used a packet cake /cookie mix for years and decided to give it a go. I had the egg and some milk also a little flour for dusting handy these were the only ingredients needed that were not in the packGrandchildren suitably aproned hands washed we opened the green pack with Scooby Doo s picture on it. Inside was the plastic Scooby Doo cutter. The cutter is just his head and neck. A bag of cookie mix also included was a tube of red decorating gel. The grandchildren eager we followed the instructions mixing the egg and milk then putting the cookie mix in a bowl and adding some of the egg and milk then we combined to make dough. Will only a little adult help the grandchildren managed this well. Each child had half the dough and rolled it out using my rolling pins we managed to cut out 9 Scooby Doo shapes and an odd shape that we called a ghost.  This did not take very long. The features of his nose and eyes had imprinted on the dough well.  The biscuits came out of the cutter fairly easily not spoiling the shape. Next we used my pallet knife slid this under the biscuits and placed them on a greased cooking tray. I gave the children my pastry brush and they brushed the remaining egg and milk on the biscuits. The biscuits went in my oven at 190c and after 10 minutes I removed the biscuits from the oven put them on a rack and let them cool.  The biscuits were a lovely brown colour do not leave them in too long I think they would burn easily.The children the squeezed the tube and decorated the biscuits with the blackcurrant gel there was just enough of this gel. The cutter was washed and saved to make other biscuits another day. These Scooby doo cookies /biscuits (I use the word biscuits as I dislike the American cookies word) were sucesful they looked good like ScoobyDoos head they tasted fine not really flavoured just plain, the blackcurrant gel did taste of blackcurrant.This Scooby Doo cookie mix is available at supermarkets it will cost between    1 and    1.50 I think this was quite a good present idea. My daughter does bake her own recipes and has cutters she uses with the children. I also bake a lot so we would have been able to use a recipe and make our own biscuits   probably cheaper however the children had fun and the cutter is a useful addition to the cutters we have. Greens is a UK company that has been making cakes and mixes since 1907. Many of the cakes, cookies have characters that children like so they are ideal for children learning to bake.Would I recommend the Scooby doo cookies? Yes.       ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6869516:3:::6609678:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5347743:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6785596:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6190414:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6866291:4:::6657747:4:::6870095:4:::6145850:4:::6844462:4:::6654507:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6855417:4:::5790028:4:::5203100:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6840580:4:::5362774:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::SuperCook Jelly Diamonds::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.12.2010::::    I often decorate cakes and biscuits. I have jelly diamonds many times. Dr Oetker has just bought out Super cook and these diamonds one were a super cook product. They come in a little plastic pot which has a label on with the nutrition information and a picture of a cake decorated with these diamonds.  The pot and design are almost identical now to when these Dr Oetker sugar diamonds were still Supercooks.The pot is quite good for storage. Remove the pots red lid and you will see many diamonds there are red ones purple ones, green, orange, white. There are 85g of jellied diamonds in this pack which I find more than enough to decorate a cake with. Theses little diamonds are fairly thick. The length of one of these diamonds is about 1cm. They are a bit like diamond shaped jelly tots. If eaten while cake decorating I notice these taste a little sweet and lightly fruit flavoured, the orange ones tasting of orange the yellow ones of lemon. They do actually taste a bit like jelly tots. They are ideal for decorating celebration cakes and also for topping those iced biscuits, or for decorating ice creams I find if I have decorated cakes with these for the children that they eat these jellies first then the icing often leaving the cake , or most of it.Allergies Information Contains Gluten, Lactic Acid   Sulphur Dioxide.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Coconut Conditioner::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::09.12.2010::::     A while ago I asked my hubby to buy me some conditioner from Tesco   s. He arrived home with coconut hair conditioner. Now I do not like coconut to eat so have been reluctant to use it. Yesterday I tried this conditioner for the first time. This slim white plastic bottle with a screw cap contains 750 ml of conditioner. I do not thin another size available. The shape and size of this slim bottle is ideal for fitting onto a shower/bath rack. The label has a picture of coconut halves on it. A bunny logo which means that this product has not been tested on animals and the ingredients are on the label. I unscrewed the lid and had a sniff it did not smell over coconutty but slightly medicated. After I had washed my hair I poured a little onto my hand it was not a very thick liquid but not over runny either. I massaged this into my hair and left it on for a couple of minutes while I showered my body. I then shower rinsed my hair. I wrapped my hair in my Turbie (previous review on this item). After I am dry after my shower I go downstairs and release my hair and brush it. There is a slight medical and coconutty smell not too overpowering. I have dried my hair now it smells fresh. My hair is easy to brush no knots. My hair is on the slightly greasy side not dry or damaged. I did find that this conditioner was good for my hair was in good condition soft and yes shiny. I looked up the price and discovered it was    1.70 a bottle working out at 22.7 per 100 ml this is much cheaper than my usual conditioner. I am very happy with my hair after using this and will be buying it again     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::6860317:3:::6860317:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5646482:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::6859830:3:::6859830:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::5092706:3:::5092706:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5253811:4:::5253811:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5255134:4:::6506577:4:::6859203:4:::5690767:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6190414:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6843355:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6850640:4:::6850640:4:::6866291:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5362774:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sprite::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::06.12.2010::::    I went shopping at Tesco after work on Friday and was quite hot I needed a drink. I choose a 500 ml bottle of sprite. This cost me    1 it s on offer 2 bottles for    1.70. Sprite is easily available in  other supermarkets and retailers of drink so you should have no problem finding it.This Sprite is in a green bottle that is shaped to make it easy to hold and drink from. Sprite is also available in 330 ml cans or a 2 litre bottle. I was desperate for a glugg of drink so once outside the supermarket I unscrewed the blue cap and drank from the green bottle .Sprite is a carbonated drink and as I undid the cap a pssssssst of air was released the drink fortunately did not fizz out of the top of the bottle , If it was shaken I think it would have done. I found the sprite refreshing but a bit gassy, I also found it sweet. There is a Sprite Zero option which has not so many calories but I had not chosen that one. There are 44 cal per 100ml and 10.6g of sugar, no wonder I found it sweet, still I needed a sugar fix felt exhausted after work. Sprite is caffeine free.There are no artificial colours in Sprite no fat either.The flavour of Sprite is lemon, lime and I found it refreshing the lime not overpowering the lemon.      ::::5511950:3:::5511950:3:::6239064:3:::6239064:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::3957:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6785596:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6860248:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6657747:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6217853:3:::6217853:3:::6654280:3:::6654280:3:::6691451:3:::5314452:3:::5314452:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5790028:3:::6778028:3:::6778028:3:::6864027:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6830048:3:::6781956:3:::6723034:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6735325:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6866291:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Pasteurised Semi Skimmed Milk::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::05.12.2010::::     I occasionally buy Tesco semi skimmed milk even though we usually use skimmed. I buy it when the grandchildren are visiting sometimes I will buy a full fat milk too. Skimmed and semi skimmed milk does not have enough calories or vitamin A in it to meet a child   s requirements. A child should not have skimmed milk until they are five semi skinned not until they are 2.In a 200 ml serving there is 240 mg of Calcium this is about half the requirement of a 4 to 10 year old . Calcium is necessary for healthy bones and teeth.  There are less calories and fat in semi skimmed milk  in 100g of skimmed milk there are 34k cal 0.1g fat in semi skimmed there are 50 kcal, 1.8g fat and full fat contains 64 kcal 3.6g fat. So using skimmed or semi skimmed milk is an easy way to reduce calories and fat in my diet. Tesco Semi skimmed milk comes in a plastic carton/bottle it is the one with a green cap and has green labelling.This skimmed milk comes in 1 Pint /568ml costing45p or a 2 pint/ 1.14 litre costing 86p or a 4 pint/2,27 Litre costing    1.55p  if you want a lot of milk a 6 Pints 3.41L bottle costing   2.17 is available. This price is standard in all the supermarkets on the my supermarket site. At Tesco until the 18th of January you can buy all except the smallest bottle on a buy two for a cheaper price offer. Except for the largest of these semi skimmed milk bottles they do fit into the bottle space in my fridge door. They all have a handle molded into the plastic bottle this does make pouring easier. To open the bottle first twist the green cap then peel back the paper /foil cover. I find pouring this milk from the bottle easy, the 6 pint bottle might be heavy for some. Now I do not often drink plain milk but I tested a drop for you. I like milk to drink when it comes straight out of the fridge I do not really like hot milk to drink it tastes  milky it is not  so obviously creamy to me as the full fat milk but I can just taste it is a little creamier than the skimmed milk I usually  have. Years ago when we first changed to skimmed or semi skimmed milk I did notice the difference in my tea it took a while to get used to and like, but now I will drink skimmed  by preference or semi skimmed milk in my tea and drinking tea with full fat milk in is not pleasant its too creamy . If you are changing to drinking skimmed milk from full fat then I suggest you  do it by trying the skimmed milk first the change is not so great. I do not notice any difference between the taste of this Tesco semi skimmed milk to others I have tried.I use Tesco semi skimmed in tea coffee, hot chocolate I make custard and cheese sauce, with it there are many, many uses. We are always told a cup of warm milk will help us sleep I can not go into the science of this statement but to some degree it is true . If I am going away I will sometimes freeze a bottle of this milk it freezes well however it does take a time to defrost, to speed it up I put the bottle of milk in a bucket of cold  water. Yes this semi skimmed milk from Tesco is fine no better no worse than others     ::::6887472:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6778633:4:::6778633:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::3957:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::6864647:4:::6864647:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5414290:4:::6657747:4:::5816422:4:::6701923:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6844462:4:::6834688:4:::6800944:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

They enjoy playing out real life with the house and other Playmobil accessories that they have to go with them. My grandchildren do not have a real dog, However they enjoy pretending they have and  making the Playmobil people take the  Playmobil dog for a walk and generally looking after it. The dog   s gets told to sit and they get fed.  My grandchildren get lost in their imaginary world and can spend ages playing with the Playmobil.This playmobil dog family would be a great addition to any play house. It includes mummy dog 3 puppies, a dog kennel, a boy figure, a feeding bowl and a string of 6 sausages. The dogs are an assortment of colours black, white and brown. One, the white puppy is in a sitting position the others standing their limbs not movable. The boy has movable arms and his hands can grip the sausages. The yellow kennel has a removable roof. These plastic puppies are quite cute a smooth plastic and are quite safe for your children. Recommended for those aged 4 and over. These toy dogs would be a good assessory for a farm or house toy scene. Hamleys toy shop  sell these for    6. On Amazon there are several places selling this toy from    4.25 upwardsWould I recommend these toys? Well yes if your child is interested in dogs or has the play Mobil house or farm.      ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::6765473:3:::6765473:3:::6860317:3:::6860317:3:::6864027:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5351312:3:::5351312:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6691451:3:::6859830:3:::6859830:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6145850:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5314452:3:::5314452:3:::6855417:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6797968:3:::6797968:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5335750:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6654507:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::6866291:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6816341:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Paracetamol Caplets::::Health::::40::::very helpful::::02.12.2010::::    I always keep some Paracetamol tablets in my first aid /medicine box at home I also keep some in the car first aid kit too. With hubby having a cold recently the pack of Paracetamol was nearly empty so when  I was  in Tesco I went to the pharmacy desk and  bought some Tesco Paracetamol Caplets.   It cost me 20p for a packet of 16 that   s 1.3p each. Asda and Sainsbury   s equivalent are the same price. Tesco also have paracetemol in tablet form or the plus type the plus means they contain caffeine I usually buy Tesco own brand of paracetamol as I find these as good and as cheap if not cheaper than others.Before you take any of these or other medicines read the information on the packet. The Tesco paracetamol Caplets have 500mg in each caplet. The dose for adults is one or two tablets with a gap of at least 4 hours before the next dose also take only 4 doses a day.  I do not think that these tablets are suitable for children under 12.I take Paracetamol if I have a mild headache they are good for taking to ease other pains and reducing temperatures. I generally find that for more severe headaches I need a stronger medicine These capulets are a good shape for someone who finds it difficult to swallow round tablets they are smooth with rounder ends. I do not have any difficulty swallowing tablets so I can not tell you from personal experience if these are easier to swallow or not, but they do seem to go down easily.  Due to health and safety rules you will not be able to buy more than 2 of these packets at the same time overdosing can cause liver damage and deathThese Tesco paracetamol  capulet   s are as good as any other at soothing and relieving pain so yes if you need paracetamol I would recommend these.I was in the jungle the other day and I could not find any headache tablets do you know why?  It   s because the Parrots eat them all.

I have seen it called a turbie twist some places. This Towel has now been thrown away. I had used it several times after dying my hair and it was badly discoloured and to be honest the ends were getting worn out and the fabric getting thin.  I think I had this and used it regularly for about 2 or 3 years.I would like another Turbie towel and was looking on line to find out if they were still available and how much they coast. I find Amazon have some identical to my old one for only    1.50.This Turbie towel is made of a thin towelling its available in white I think a more expensive one comes in pink. To describe this it   s a shaped towel a bit like a tear drop. The larger end is shaped like a hood/cap to go across the neck at the back of your head. The width of this towel is good fits across the head then the part that is over the front of your head has a long taper to a point. There is sufficient towel in this taper to twist and then tuck the end into a loop at the back of the towel. I find that for my fairly long hair that this towel is good After I wash my hair I usually put my head forward and brush it over the top of my head . Then I position the towel at the back of my head the point going over the front. I then catch all my hair in it twist the turbie towel put my head upright and flip it over my head.. This is better than using an ordinary towel as a turban it is thinner and shaped so not so bulky. This stayed on my head fairly well a towel does not. I find it ideal to wrap my long hair up in so that I do not get drips everywhere and it keeps my damp locks on my shoulders. This towel absorbs some of the wetness from my hair till I take the towel off to dry and style my hair.I usually  let my hair dry with out the hairdryer and with my hair being long and thick this takes a while and I find this towel good for while I  make tea or do other tasks  as it keeps my hair out of the way .I do dye my own hair and I used my old turbie to wrap round my had while I was waiting for the colour to set,  stops my   dressing gown getting coloured  too.So I shall now  be looking to buy another I think Wilkinson   s sell them if I can not find one in the high street I shall order on line       ::::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6459776:4:::6459776:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::8689:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6847439:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::3957:4:::6539681:4:::6539681:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6830048:4:::6866291:4:::5362774:4:::6844462:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Halsall Mr Potato Head::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::30.11.2010::::    Mr Potato head is a toy that has been available for many years now, he was first produced in 1952. Mr Potato head is made by Hasbro. Hasbro has been making toys since 1923.  This toy has changed since it was first produced but is basically the same. The first Mr Potato head which I remember was just the limbs and features.  Mum and dad supplied the large real potato.The Mr Potato head which I have been playing with recently has a large brown hollow plastic potato shaped body that comes with the set. Inside the Hasbro, Playskool potato head body is a place to store his appendages.  I understand that some people find the trapdoor falls of easily and that it   s not easy to keep it together, however the Mr Potato head I play with does not have a great problem with this. However it   s usually adults and not the children putting the pieces in here. Sometimes all of the potato head features will not fit inside the body. The basic Mr Potato head which I play with and  am reviewing comes with 2 white arms which are bent at the elbow he has a bright red nose, a black moustache, some gleaming white teeth, a tongue, 2 pink ears, a pair of blue shoes, a pair of yellow spectacles and a green hat. Unlike the real potato there are holes premade in the plastic one to position the features. However this does not stop the children I play alongside putting the nose where the mouth should be or an arm where his hat should go. I have seen many strange arrangements of Mr Potato heads features on his potato body. Some of these misplacements are deliberate some accidental. I love the wicked smile I get when one of my children deliberately puts them in the wrong place. Mr Potato head is a fun way of teaching children about body parts their names and where they go. While you are playing with your child get them to show you their arm, nose, mouth as they position Mr Potato heads. Recommended age is over 24 months. I think a two year old will find it difficult to insert the parts into the correct position on the potato as they are quite tricky to inset however with a little help from mummy or daddy they should go in easily. I think a 3 year old should to be able to push the features into the body. This toy is quite durable the one I was playing with several years old.I would recommend this toy as a gift it costs from    5, 99 at Amazon at Argos it cost    6.99. I think this is a reasonable price for this toy.  There are several variations on the  basic Mr Potato head that I have features a Mrs. Potato head, a toy story potato head , a Spud lightyear I think it would be fun to have the 5 Different Spud Parts And Pieces ( King, Doctor, Princess, Chef and Pirate)  so they could be mixed and matched to make  humorous potato heads. The first Mr Potato head was introduced to us in 1952 these were just the body parts you inserted into real potatoes. Hasbro has changed them a bit since then. Hasbro is an American firm that has been making childrens toys since the 19 40   s it is one of the largest toy manufacturers.I have just discovered there are on line Mr Potato head colouring in pages at. Of course colouring is  spelt coloring as it   s a US site.http://www.hasbro.com/playskool/en_ US/play/details.cfm?guid=41512619-0bf5-43f8-ba2e-df3b96246780      ::::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6691451:4:::3957:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::6830048:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6506577:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6855417:4:::6859203:4:::5719918:4:::6145850:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5816422:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::5203100:4:::5362774:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6866291:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6539681:4:::6539681:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Snack Pack Raisins::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::29.11.2010::::    I love little packets of things, these Snack pack Californian raisins from Tesco are no exception, I will be honest though I do not buy these very often as they work out more expensive than buying a large pack of Tesco Californian raisins. These raisins cost    1.80 These tiny red boxes contain 14g that s not very many raisins. However there are 18 of these little boxes in a red plastic bag which has a see through bag middle. Sun-Maid does a bag which also contains 18 small card boxes of California Raisins Mini-Snacks. However this pack although bigger cost    2.52. I find these snack packs of Tesco s raisins handy when we are going out for a picnic.TThey are also ideal for a child s packed lunch. These little boxes are so small you could easily put them in a pocket. They are great for travelling and will not melt like chocolate snacks. They are easier to take with you than a large packet as thety do not split and spill so easily. Now open the big plastic pack by tearing or cutting and the little rectangular boxes only a couple of cms long will spill out. These are red boxes with the word raisins and a picture of a leaf and a few raisins. Open the flap end of the thin red card box, pour the raisins into your hand. These boxes might be a bit fiddly for young children and those with poor finger control to open. I sometimes use these little boxes and similar for fine motor exercise s getting the children to open them and of course they are motivated by the raisin reward afterwards. The raisins smell a little fruity. The look a fair size, not the plumpest that I have seen but not bad. Pop a couple in your mouth, if you empty the whole packet full into your hand you could put them all in your mouth at the same time. But not being as pig, one or 2 at a time is good. These raisins taste good they are sweet and fruity. The outer skin of these raisins is not too tough and the centre is quite soft not juicy but moist. Although these are healthier than a sweet snack there are 290 kcal per 100g that s 40 kcal in each pack. No fat in these raisins, lots of fruit sugar though 69.3g per 100g 9.7g per 14g pack. there is only 0.1g of salt in 100g. After emptying these little boxes I try to save some, why? for refilling of course . I buy a kg pack of Tesco Californian raisins that work out as 22.8p per 10g and refill the boxes. The pack of boxes works out at 76.6p per 100g. These little boxes are also good for junk craft with the children. Filled with a little paper these boxes are ideal for the pretend shop too. Raisins are dried red grapes and 1 heaped tablespoon of raisins equals 1 of your 5 a day fruit portions.      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5347743:4:::6609678:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6847439:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5816422:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5954627:4:::5954627:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6781956:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6816341:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6525735:4:::6525735:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6866291:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6821514:5:::6821514:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Carex Original Moisturising Handwash::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::28.11.2010::::    Carex Original HandwashI have sometimes bought this hand wash for use at home and have occasionally used it elsewhere.This liquid handwash is an antibacterial one. This comes in a clear plastic container that has a shaped curve to make it easier to grip. This is a slim bottle that fits well on the thin surround to my hand basin often I find the cylindrical bottles take up too much width. The label is a light blue swirl looking like water and a darker blue area with the name carex in white.The lid of the bottle is a lever squeeze release to squirt the required amount of soap onto   my hands. Holding the bottle in one hand I depress the lever a little .and squirt a little soap onto the other. I never depress any soap bottle lids fully as I always think they deliver too much soap. The liquid soap is a cool, blue colour. It   s quite a thick liquid not runny. The smell of this soap is a clean one it   s not too strong thoughApplying to wet hands it lathers well. Depending on how dirty my hands are I will wash my hands then dry on my towel. My hands smell fresh and clean not over perfumed though.This liquid handwash does its job well cleans, kills bacteria, makes my hands feel hygienic. After using this handwash my hands do feel quite soft the moisturiser in it is quite good.This handwash is available in a 250ml the RRP    1.55 I note http://www.wilkinsonplus.com are selling it for 99p in store price the same. Superdrug is selling it for    1.55 as is Tesco. This handwash also available in 500ml bottles with the lever cap this cost    2.09 in Tesco. This Carex original handwash is also sold in a refill bottle with a plain cap not a squirty lever one these are a little cheaper 1.05 for 250 ml refill and    2.98 for 750 ml refill.Yes I like this handwash I do recommend it     ::::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5414290:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6816341:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6786865:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6692766:4:::6692766:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6866941:4:::6866941:4:::6845486:4:::6868052:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6866291:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6840580:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Jenny's Restaurant, Dunstable::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::27.11.2010::::    Jenny   s restaurant in Dunstable is fairly near the crossroads in the centre of town. In West Street on the way to Dunstable downs.One morning last week I took my grandchildren swimming in Dunstable and to give my daughter a longer break decided I would treat them to a lunch out. I choose this restaurant as it was   just over half way to my daughters house from the swimming pool we were walking.Since we had been for a swim and it was not the sunniest of days I decided a hot meal would be in order. I did not want to spend much and had noted that this restaurant sold fairly cheap meals often looked fairly busy. So decided to visit Jennies Restaurant.  The front of the restaurant is painted red. A door in the middle and a window either side. Walking into the restaurant There is a table seating 6 and on the left is the counter to order food. There are several more counters all seating about 6 people in a row behind the one at the front. Behind the counter are is closed in I think the kitchen there. We went towards the back of the restaurant and sat down. The seats comfortable enough. There is enough seating for between 20 and 30 people I would guestimate After sitting awhile I could smell the fat. I thought the place fairly clean, not spotless but I was happy. We were attended to by a youngish girl there were 2 people on duty that I could see. IO was offered a menu the children offered a childrens menu. The choice was about the same really as the adults only smaller portions for the children. My 7 year grandson wanted egg chips and beans, me too my granddaughter had to have the same. These cost    2.20p each; the children also choose a blackcurrant drink in a box each. I choose gammon egg and chips this cost me    4 something cant remember how much but it was under a fiver... I think all the childrens meals    2.20 the adult meals all under or around a fiver The girl serving us was very pleasant. The service was quite quick. The children got a fair size meal; it would have been enough for me. The eggs were quite well cooked me too does not like the yolk so I cut the egg separated the white for her to eat. I tasted a few of their beans (I was not having any) my meal came and I got a good portion of a gammon slice an n egg and chips. The chips were thin cut chips I prefer fatter chips, but they were cooked well enough. . The gammon slice was ok it was one of those preformed one you buy in a pack at the supermarket, fair enough for my under a fiver meal. I had a cup of tea which cost   again I can not remember exactly but it was under. The children of course wanted pudding; ice cream with chocolate sauce I can not again remember the price but in total me paid under    15 for our meal and drinks. The food was a good meal for what we paid and what I expected. I knew the children would find something they liked here as basically it was chicken nuggets, sausages beans chips.  When we left the children were both given a sweet lollipop.   I think it   s a good thing to take children out to eat to get used to different environments. To have to sit know how to and behave when out. I was happy to have taken the children here to eat. The staff were pleasant the food fine. If when in Dunstable you want fairly cheap fair portions of a meal with chips then this restaurant will fit this bill. However if you want something more refined go elsewhere.  We walked the 10 minutes to my daughter   s house, I know she was happy to have had a break and the children happy with their swim then lunch .     ::::6157866:3:::6157866:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::6750576:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5414290:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5261772:4:::6692766:4:::6692766:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6868052:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5690767:4:::5362774:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5790028:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6852170:4:::6852170:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6539681:4:::6539681:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::5203100:4:::6865146:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6735325:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6866291:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6856387:5:::6856387:5:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Thomas the Tank Engine Tri Scooter::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.11.2010::::    Tri wheeled scooters are popular with children we have some at work and my granddaughter has one too. These scooters are made in a variety of colours and with plaques of different Childrens TV characters. This is a scooter for Thomas the Tank engine fans, there are quite a lot of his fans in the under 6 year old age bracket. This scooter is designed for children aged 3 and over, but I have seen over 2 s but under 3   s use it too. This Thomas scooter is blue with red handle grips and the plaque on the centre of the handle bars is red with a picture of Thomas face on. I have seen children looking at and touching this picture.The height of the handle bars is adjustableThe footplate is blue too with a number 1 on it this has an anti slip surface.  The black wheel at the front is inch /15 the back 2 wheels are inch /12cm. These have puncture proof tyres. The weight is weight 20 kg which is quite light for me to carry across the playground and put away at the end of the day. This three wheeled scooter is great the children love it the third wheel gives added stability. . The children can scoot this easily across the playground the wheels turn round well. . This scooter is fairly durable ours is a year old now and used a lot.This scooter is good for children to learn balancing and coordination, gives them lots of exercise too. Argos are selling it for    19.95, http://www.amazon.co.uk is selling it for    17.49. Note this is not the 3-wheeled scooter with secret drawer containing 4 vehicles which retails for a higher price. Would I recommend?

       " '5247778::::The Waterton Arms (Deeping St James), Peterborough::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::25.11.2010::::     We visited my mothering law in Peterborough recently and decided to go to the Waterton Arms at Deeping St James. Deeping St James is a village a few miles out of Peterborough.Food is served in the evenings on a weekday and lunchtimes on a Sunday. Mother in law phoned 01778342219 to book us a table.The Waterton Arms is an old brick built pub on the bend on church  street. The parking to the pub is just round the side of the pub. We went through a side gate into the garden we had the grandchildren with us and my daughter. The garden was a fairly long thin strip grassed with a narrow path. There were a couple of tables and a few chairs and some little tikes play equipment  I would say the equipment fine for  under 6 year olds really.We visited in September so it was too cold for   eating outside the children did not want to play outside. So we went into the pub went to the bar and said we had booked and we were shown a table. I bought our drinks at the bar  I paid upfront but could have put it on the tab this pub sell a selection of real  ales I had a half of Timmy Taylors ,  hubby had some Adnams mother in law had wine, my daughter and the children juice.We sat at our table and read the menu. We decided to have starters and a main, no pudding. I can not clearly recall exactly what we ate but hubby had a soup mother in law and I had pate. Four our main husband and I both choose the lamb mother in law choose a chicken dish with rice. With the lamb came roast potatoes and a kidney and broccoli au gratin. Childrens portions were available. My grandson had macaroni cheese I can not remember what my granddaughter had. The children were treated to ice cream for dessertWe could have had tea and coffee but decided to go back to ma in laws for a cup and a chat before we   left for home . The  lamb was very tasty  and the broccoli tasted good too, I like kidneys many people do not, do not be put off by this as there were several other choices  of meals . My grandson loved his macaroni cheese  The pub was not very busy, but this was midweek.  This felt a family friendly pub the staff pleasant to the grandchildren. I think that it would seat about 50 -60 people inside. The  staff were friendly. The price I felt was OK I seem to recall it was about    12.00 each.I took my granddaughter to the toilets which were adequate, mind the step down as you go back into the bar.We enjoyed our meal here and would be happy to go back another time      ::::5633146:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::6866941:3:::6866941:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6657747:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5414290:4:::6539681:4:::6539681:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6190414:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6758309:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5261772:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6735325:4:::5335750:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6816341:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6855417:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6866291:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5203100:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6840580:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? (Picture Puffin) - Bill Martin::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::23.11.2010::::    Today in school we read Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see This book written by Bill Martin junior and illustrated by Eric Carl was first published in 1984. This book is suitable for foundation stage and key stage 1 children. We have both a big  book H:457 mm; W:354 mm, handy for reading to the class, a board book 6.9 x 5.1 inches and a hard cover book measuring 7 3/4 x 10 inches there   s also a paper back book measuring 210 x 270 mm available. as a book  of many sizes one I am sure that will fit your needs.The paperback   s R R P is    6.99 Amazon has a new one for    3.99. The board book   s RRP is    4.50 available for    2.10 from Amazon.I really like the illustrations by Eric Carl. Each double page has an illustration of an animal the first one the Brown bear. The pictures are simple designs and bright vibrant colours. The illustrations look like a tissue paper collage. The other animals featured are a Red bird, a Yellow duck, A Blue horse, a Green frog, a Purple cat, a white dog, a Black sheep, a Gold fish. a Teacher, Children.This book is a lovely book to read to children it is a rhyming book with a good rhythm. The words are simple and repetitive.For example on one page the words say Brown bear brown bear what do you see. The facing page says I see a red bird looking at me. The page has to be turned to see the red bird there is no picture of it on the same page as the brown bear. The book continues repeating the same words inserting the correct animal name for the picture.  The book asks each ten animals what they see then the last animal sees the teacher who in turn sees the children. The very last page the children see all the animals.I teach special needs children and they love this book, this book is suitable for 2 year olds even younger, through to about 6 years old. It is ideal for colour recognition work alright I have never seen a blue horse before or a purple cat. You could use this book for talking about and learning about animals.  Reading with your child from an early age is important, getting them to understand that the written shapes are words and also helping children acquire listening skills. This book is a good early book to have at home or in nursery. If you go to http://www.dltk-teach.com /books/brownbear/index.htm you will find  colouring in pintables of these animals .  If you go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ylskfqlh84 NR=1 you will see and hear  the book being read. In fact if you go on line you will find lots of info and ideas work linked to this book. Do I recommend this book for your tot ?

       " '5247778::::Boots Tempo Tissues::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::20.11.2010::::    I   bought a big pack of ten packs of Tempo tissues earlier this year as each one is a convenient size to take out of the house on trips anywhere. Each individual pack contains 9 tissues. The packs are a good size to put in a pocket or a handbag The clear plastic wrapping of these tissues has a blue strip with white writing and info.I just used my last packet of these .These little plastic packs are fairly easy to open and its easy just to remove one and keep the other   s  enclosed in the protective packet. These Tempo tissues have no design on them they are just a plain white. The tissues are folded up quite small in the packet and when the tissues opened out they are about a 21 cm square. These tissues are a strong 4 ply. These are a good thickness for a snotty nose .A s well as my own nose. I have used them to wipe childrens noses and find that rarely does the snot soak through and get on my fingers. These tissues are also suitable for a man   s nose my husband has used them when he has a cold.  These tissues do not fall apart like some. I have lightly dampened them to clean a wounded, scratched knee.I do not find them rough like some tissues they are soft. This is a brand of tissue I shall continue to buy as I find them strong and soft.I have seen these tissues on sale in chemists and station forecourts also in some newsagents. I seem to remember mine cost about a pound for the 10 pack I bought on line they seem to sell for between    1 and    2. However I think it unlikely this is the sort of product you will buy on line unless you are ordering lots or add it to your grocery order. These Tempo tissues were a Proctor and Gamble product but I believe they were sold to S C A.. I think Tempo tissues also available in different sized packs and some with menthol for easing breathing too. So would I recommend these tissues? A definite YES     ::::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6785596:3:::6825635:3:::6825635:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6830048:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5414290:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6859203:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6800944:4:::6771611:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6735325:4:::6816341:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6866291:4:::5203100:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hedrin Head Lice Detection Comb::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::19.11.2010::::      I have encountered head lice many times Sometimes my own hair, my daughter   s hair, my grand childrens hair and on the hair of children that I have worked with.Over the years I have bought many treatments and combs for detecting, evicting and exterminating the little creatures. This nit comb from Hedrin is one that I have used. This nit comb will not get rid or those little creatures on its own you will need to use lotion or some other form of eradicating the lice as well. This comb is for you to detect the heard lice in hair before treating and for removing the bodies and checking that hair is free of lice. This comb is a white plastic it is shaped to fit into a hand. Holding this comb is easy. The teeth on this comb are not very long only just go through a tress of hair. These teeth are spaced thinly together so as to catch the lice. You can use it on either wet or dry hair. Wet hair with hair conditioner on is best. I have used this comb several times and do not like it much. I have found a few lice with this but have found more with other combs. I have not been able to remove nits (eggs with it).It is very difficult to use this comb on long thick hair most lice/nit combs are though. I am only able to comb through a few strands at the same time. I find the plastic teeth too soft they bend out of position making the gap to wide to catch lice in. When I have used this comb it gets dirty with the natural oil from hair. It is very difficult to clean. I have tried washing it in warm water with shampoo, using a tooth brush to get between the teeth of the comb.  I was not really happy with this comb so when I had the opportunity I bought and used another comb. This head lice comb cost    3.40 from http://www.boots.com. The head lice comb that I prefer is the nitty gritty this cost    9.99 from boots. This may seem expensive but it   s worth it it   s a sturdy comb and you do not need lice lotions see http://www.nittygritty.co.uk/site/home.asp. I have also used a robi comb, an electronic comb battery powered which zapp   s the little creature   s this was also good.So, no I do not recommend this Hedrin nit comb.If you wish to see information and pictures of head lice the link below is good. http://www.nhs.uk /conditions/head-lice/Pages/Introduction.aspx     ::::5633146:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5414290:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6785596:4:::6800944:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5954627:4:::5954627:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5203100:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840580:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6735325:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6866291:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6843584:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6859203:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5362774:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Antihisan Cream::::Health::::40::::very helpful::::18.11.2010::::    I have used Antihistan cream for many years now. I always have a tube in my first aid box. I always take a tube on holiday. I like to walk by the river and reservoirs and these are prime places for midge s, mosquito s which do like to feast on me. I like walking in the countryside and have on occasion been stung badly by nettles. This cream is an antihistamine it does relieve the itching and stinging. It is also useful for sunburn and mild burns and scalds. This cream is white and you squeeze it out of the tube like thick toothpaste. You need only use a little directly on to the bite or sting. This cream needs to be rubbed in to be absorbed into the skin. This cream works well for me it really does relieve the itching well. It works best if applied as soon as possible. Apply this cream 2 or 3 times a day if necessary for up to 3 days. I try to leave the last application till just before I go to bed as the bites sometimes will keep me awake itching and scratching. This cream does not realty have any smell to it . There are a few cautions with this antihistan cream so do read the information leaflet that comes with the package. It is not suitable for under 2 years old, or for pregnant and breast feeding women. Not to be used on large areas of skin and not on the same piece of skin for more than 3 days. Not suitable for open wounds or for excma. I think some people develop an allergic reaction to this cream. So do read the info before using or ask the pharmacist. However for those of us for whom this is suitable it really is a good itch and sting relief cream This Antihistan cream comes in a white 20g tube. The tube comes in a yellow and white card box. It s available from chemists the price is about    3.50      ::::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::6701923:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6750576:3:::6657747:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5719918:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5414290:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5203100:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6757811:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6735325:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6635472:4:::6635472:4:::6855353:4:::6855353:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6816341:4:::6840580:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Everbuild Bath & Sanitary Silicone Sealant White::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::16.11.2010::::     I have been doing a few DIY jobs around the house this half term. In my bathroom a couple of the tiles have come unsealed from around the bath and some of the seal around the shower tray has peeled away. So when I was in my local DIY shop I bought some white Everbuild Bath   Sanitary Silicone Sealant. I have used sealants before but I checked the details on this one before I bought it.  It is designed for using in bathrooms or kitchens where the humidity is high. It makes a waterproof seal so ideal for around the shower. I read its good for sealing around PVCu window frames I have a frame that could do with sealing I might do that sometime. As well as white this sealant comes in clear and ivory. This cost me    4.20 from a small local shop I imagine BQ prices might be cheaper, on line I note the price varies from about    4 to    6.This sealant comes enclosed in a tall thin plastic cartridge containing 310 ml To apply this sealant I needed a sealant gun, fortunately we have an old one of my dads in the garage. So on Monday after I had cleaned the area I was going to work on I put the tube of sealant in the gun and pierced the nozzle, I pierced it with the end of a pair of scissors and set to work.   The silicone sealant squirted out of the nozzle when I depressed the plunger on the gun. It comes out in a thin line I keep pressing my gun till I have a line along the tile edge that needs sealing. Then I used my finger . I know dad Maybe I should have used a flat knife or tool to spread the sealant flat (I can see dad in heaven looking down at me and saying use the proper tool Mary). However my fingers good enough I smoothed the silicone sealant along the crack making sure it covered well.  The sealant remained alright t smooth down for a few minutes then it began to set.This was not really a messy job. . Yes I know I had sealant on my fingers  waterproof so would not wash off but just waited a minute then I rubbed it off a bit like Copydex does , then I washed my hands. Now I just had to wait till the sealant was dry before I had a bath. This does not take very long and since I did this job in the morning I think it was ok in the evening but I left it till the next day to make sure. A few days late I am happy with the seal around the bath and shower. I only used a small amount of this  sealant from the tube I looked at the details and it said  it will last  for a year so I put it in the garage sealed the top and  will try to use the remainder another time 1 DIY job is enough for this half term break . This sealant contains a fungicide so it will stop mould and black stains around the shower tray seal. The white will not discolour with age. I think this is the same sealant as one I used on the bathroom units 6 years ago and they are still white not yellowed or grey.  The information says the sealant is permanently flexible, feeling along the crack which I sealed it is soft and I can see that it could be described as flexible. When I clean the bath I include wiping over the area between the bath and tiles which is sealed and it cleans well     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6838583:4:::6838583:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::3957:4:::6758098:4:::6758098:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6758309:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6562051:4:::6562051:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5414290:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6800944:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6866291:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::5203100:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::TREsemme Oval Porcupine Hairbrush::::Beauty::::30::::very helpful::::15.11.2010::::    I have this Oval porcupine hairbrush from Tresemme. I have owned this brush for several years now. I also own other Tressemme brushes .Although  the oval porcupine is a well made brush this one is not my favourite, hubby just said he preferred the other brush too. I have very long thick straight hair this brush might suit shorter hair better  This brushes full lenghth is 24.1/2 cm. The handle 11 cm the head 13.1/2 .This is a black brush. The head is firmly fitted to the handle where the join is there is a silver white ring. The handle has a hole through the end if you wanted you could thread a ribbon through it to hang it up, I do not. The handle has some ridges at the side for easy gripping, the name Tresemme is on the handle. The head oval in shape is 6.     cm across at the widest point.. The bristles are made of 50  percent natural and 50   ceramic bristles the length of the natural bristles slightly shorter than the ceramic ones.When brushing the ceramic bristles do tonight through my hair, however the real bristle does not. However this is a softer brushing than one with just ceramic bristles.  I think this a combination of the natural bristles and the fact that the bristles are on a cushioned head. When I use this brush I am happy with the result but prefer the other Tresemme brush that I own. After I have brushed my hair some of my hairs have come out, they usually do. I find that my long hairs are caught in the bristles twined around the bristles. Cleaning it takes a while I use a comb and remove the hairs and fluff. I wash my brush occasionally with warm soapy water.Durability well mine is several year old bristles still in good condition. The brush when new is a shiny black it is now mostly dull. Would I recommend this brush? Well not really, its ok but I prefer the ceramic styling brush and my little paddle brush.. This Oval porcupine brush costs    6.50 at Boots on or off line     ::::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6603737:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6843584:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6866291:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6735325:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6657747:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6781956:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6816341:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6853604:4:::6853604:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Kraft Dairylea Triangles::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::14.11.2010::::    I recently ate a Dairylee cheese triangle. These cheese triangles have been available since 1950. Most of my memories of these cheese triangles are from my childhood I was born in 54. Like me the size of these triangles has changed now I think each triangle wieghs 17.5g When I looked at an old pack they were 22g per triangle.. Unfortunately my weight seems to be going up not down like the dairy lee triangles. These small triangles are circular wheel boxes containing 8 or 16 triangles since 8 of these triangles make a circle the 16 box is twice as thick and has a double layer. The design on the lid has changed a few times since I was born but staying the same blue  and green with the creamy yellow words.These little soft creamy cheese triangles are each wrapped in silver foil. When I was a child there was not a red string tab to pull that makes opening these triangles so easy. I used to battle with undoing the edges of the silver foil triangle usually making a squidgy mess of it. Then when I was allowed a knife I would cut it in half this was the easies way to get into the cheese.Now I have the cheese triangle out of its wrapper to eat it. I just put my triangle on a small cracker and ate it. These cheese triangles are very soft and squashy they are good to spread on bread. This makes a good spreading exercise for children with the reward of eating the cheese on bread, or toast afterwards. It is easier to spread them if they have been out of the fridge for a while. A good activity to do with children is to cut a piece of bread circular with a cutter then get them to spread the cheese on. After the cheese is on let them help themselves to a selection of raisins, slice of tomato maybe some cucumber circles and make a face on the cheese. Be creative you could always use some cress for hair. Ok so I have the cheese triangle on my biscuit, what did it taste like? very mild  quite creamy  but very, very bland. I now know why I have not chosen to eat one of these for ages. This cheese is fine for a child who does not like strong flavours.As you can imagine these are not suitable for those with dairy allergies. There are no artificial colourings flavours or preservatives added and there are 42 kcal per triangle  In Tesco these cost 95p for an 8 per pack   ( 140g)     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6750576:3:::5719918:4:::6866291:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6735325:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6543812:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6225648:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5414290:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6657747:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5203100:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6834688:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6430682:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Dove Silk Glow Body Lotion::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::11.11.2010::::    Dove Silk Glow Body Lotion  Do I glow after I have rubbed Dove silk glow body lotion all over my skin? I received this 250 ml Dove silk glow body lotion as a gift last year and   used some on my skin after a shower this evening.The creamy white plastic bottle it is in is shaped to make it easy to hold the lid a flip up one is easy to lift. I easily squeeze a little on top my hands. The cream that comes out is a fairly thick fluid. It   s smells pleasant quite light and clean.Now I rub some into my arm just a little rubbing and the cream is absorbed well. I did not put too much on just squeezed a little onto the palm of my hand. The cream feels nice and soft my skin drinks it in and does feel soft afterwards. Now does my skin glow? Immediately after I would say yes it   s a slight glimmer a moist glimmer. Now about 2 hours later I compare my arms, one I did not put this cream on. Now yes thee arm I treated does feel softer than the other now. Does it shine does it glow? Tea arm I put the cream on does not glow any more than the arm I did not treat. The smell still lingers.So my conclusion is it is an easy to apply cream well absorbed does make my skin feel soft but not glow.I do like to moisturise my skin after a shower and other times too. I received this as a present so yes I am satisfied with it but I think I will find other creams I like as much if not more. I probably will not bother to purchase for myself I am not sure how much this cost on the high street  the R R P is    3.29  but  Amazon are selling it for    3.79 and http://www.semichem.co.uk are selling it for    1.99     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6738963:3:::6738963:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6750576:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6852684:3:::6852684:3:::6834688:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::6552833:3:::6552833:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6816870:3:::6816870:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6861309:3:::6861309:3:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6723241:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6840398:4:::6840398:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6735325:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5414290:4:::6781956:4:::5362774:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6723034:4:::5203100:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6840580:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6830048:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Pop To The Shops::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::10.11.2010::::    I recently popped to my local charity shop taking some of the grandchildren   s old toys and looking for new ones. I found the Orchard toys Pop to the shops.  Orchard toys make a good range of educational toys they are often found in early year   s settings. They are well made and educational.  This game cost me    2 at the charity shop the corners of the cardboard box were broken and mended by sellotape but the cards inside were still in very good condition not bent or chewed. The RRP of this game is    9 W H Smiths and Argos are selling it for    7.99 as are a lot of shops on line. This game is for children aged 5 to 9 years old, since my granddaughter nearly 5 and my grandson just 8 this should be ideal. The game is suitable for 4 players so Nana and granddad will have to play too or perhaps mummy or daddy. The game can be adapted for fewer than 4 players so if the adults do not want to join in that will be fine  Now let   s set the game up its easy to do. There are 4 thick jigsaw like pieces of card that fit together to make a 35cm square. On each of these wipe clean pieces a shop is printed underneath the shop name each shop has a picture of the shop owner in the doorway. Then in the shop window which is divided into 6. Each space has a picture of an item that the shop sells. For Example the bakers sell a chocolate cake, a sandwich, a cream cake 2 muffins and a meat pie. Each of these has a price written on it all multiples of 10p from 10 p to    1.20. This game is a good educational game. It links to key stage 1 and 2 math   s.  It is also good for social development sharing and taking turns. Learning about the disappointment about not having enough money for the things you want to buy. Yes you will get a few squabbles, but this is also good for their development learning how to get on with others , how to cope with the  disappointment of losing the game . Learning how to win is important too.  It is good to interact with children by playing games like this, a time away from the computer, a time for bonding.I like to think I am creating a happy store of memories for my grandchildren. I am glad I found this game in the charity shop. The pieces seem very durable and I am sure will still be in good condition when we have outgrown it I can see me passing this game onto school, probably in a different container. We have played this a few times since I bought it .my grandson finds it quite easy but still  enjoys the game my granddaughter does struggle with adding the coins up to the right price but with a little help is fine. Grasping the rules of the game was easy after a couple of games they remember it. I think the children are beginning to develop a favourite shop my grandson the bakers where he can pretend to eat his buns, my granddaughter the newsagents where she pretends to eat the sweets and hides the sweet card. ( not really part of the game however ads a fun element )  Now to play the game____________________ Each player chooses a shop. The newsagents,  the green grocer, the mini market or the bakers. Each of these shops is different  colour and there are 4  small cylindrical counter with  a  round end which match the colour of the shop a yellow one for the mini market a red one  for the newsagent blue for the bakery  a green for the green grocer of course. Each player has a counter to match their shop and puts the counter in their doorway.  squared path across the board links the sops together the counters are moved along this path.There are 48 3cm square wipe clean thick cards, with 2 card   s of each item in the shops.  One of the small cards are placed over each of the picture   s in the shops and the other cards are placed, spread on the table face down. There are some 10p 20p and 50p plastic coins which go with this set they are good representation of the real thing. One player is chosen to be the banker. Each player is given 10p 2 20p and 2 50p coins. The banker keeps the rest in his bank which is the blue circle in the centre of the game The first player chooses a card from those placed upside down. If you choose one of the items your own shop sells then you replace it and choose another. How you choose the person that goes first is up to you toss a coin, youngest goes first  Take turns to throws a dice, one should be included in a new set however my second hand one did not, never mind I have plenty of dice from other games.  The counter is moved clockwise as many spaces as is thrown on the dice. Then it   s the next players turn. When a player reached the shop with their matching item they politely ask for it and pay the correct money.  They return their counter to thier own shop they then keep the cards and take another one.

       " '5247778::::Clarks Edeible Petal Ladies Shoe::::Fashion::::40::::very helpful::::09.11.2010::::    Edible Petal clarks shoe . ciao has made a spelling mistake   Just recently my Achilles tendon has stopped hurting after many years I wanted to wear other shoes rather than just the comfortable Asics gel trainers that I have been wearing.Although I would love a pair of killer heels some stilettos I   thought I was maybe not ready for those yet and went into the Clarks shop to try on some sensible shoes. After trying on several pairs and walking around the shop in them to make sure they were comfortable and fitted well I choose a pair of Clarks Kays Edible Petal.I need a wide fitting shoe and most of them do look old lady in care home type shoes but  these did not look like that they were smart. These shoes are an everyday shoe they are made of leather. They are available in midnight black, teal green or wine red I choose black as the most versatile colour.These shoes are a flat shoes they are a casual bar shoe, (no not one to wear at the bar to act casual in) These could  be described as a Mary Jane shoe. The bar/strap that goes across the instep has Velcro on it so you thread it through the clasp and pull the strap to the tightness which is comfortable for you the strap then folds back on itself and the Velcro   grips it down the strap will go almost the entire width back over the shoe again.  The front of the shoe has some patterning there are two small sporty perforated panels that go along from the sides to the front. The heels and toes are plain leather. This leather is soft. These shoes feel comfortable on. I am used to comfortable gel soles and to wearing  innersoles  I wear these new shoes  without innersoles and find the underfoot cushioning that these Kays shoes very comfortable . The sole does not really have any grips on it but is flexible, Because I was slightly wearing other shoes rather than my comfy trainers IO broke these shoes in slowly. The assistant in the shop advised me to wear them indoors and  if they were not suitable they would refund me. So for a couple of days I wore them indoors not venturing out to get them muddy or scratched. I found them very comfortable. After that I wore them on shopping trips and then into work all day. I have now broken them in and can wear them all day without even thinking about what shoes I am wearing. I find these shoes very comfortable.Comfort really is the important thing in a pair of shoes for me. I also do want an attractive pair of shoes and although I have heard crocs are comfortable  they are ugly. These Clarks Kays Edible Petal although not trendy are a good looking sensible everyday shoe.  These shoes available at Clarks shoe shops and other retailers that sell Clarks shoes on or off line they costI am not sure why they are called edible petal, I guess if I was desperate I could boil them up and eat them. Well probably not they would be hard chewing.     ::::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5414290:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5301762:4:::5301762:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5244400:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5203100:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6840580:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6830048:4:::6850636:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hovis Digestive Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::08.11.2010::::    I do like a biscuit with my cheese. I will often buy Hovis digestive biscuits. I usually shop in Tesco s where I not these biscuits are 75p, looking on line I see that Sainsbury, Asda and Ocado are selling them for the same price. These biscuits come in a red package with the Hovis emblem on it and the words digestive biscuit at the ends there is a yellow tear of strip to make opening a little easier. After I open a packet of these I put the ones we have not eaten in a container to stop them going soft Inside are 250g of these lovely biscuits. These biscuits are attractive they are shaped like a loaf of bread with the name Hovis imprinted on it. These Hovis digestive biscuit s look a healthy option. They are a lovely golden brown. If I am serving these to guest they look good arranged on my wooden bread board The biscuits look like they have a close texture not a crumbly one like some other digestive biscuits. These biscuits are a good size they are quite thick too a substantial biscuit. there are only about 12 in a packet They contain oats and wheat and whey they are also produced in a factory where nuts are used, so do be careful if you have allergies. There are 306 kcal in 100g of these biscuits 37 kcal per biscuit Taking a bite from one of these biscuits and it s a harder bite than many digestive biscuits and it is not crumbly.This biscuit does have that digestive oaty, wheaty taste a wholesome taste and these biscuits are not sweet. They are not as sweet as other plain digestive biscuits. These biscuits are ideal for eating with cheese spread with a cream cheese or eat with a chunk of cheddar. Although they do not taste very sweet these biscuits will go fine with a cup of tea lovely to dunk as being a closer texture they do not fall apart as easily as a standard digestive. I shall certainly be serving these with cheese at Christmas time. I expect I might nibble some before too.      ::::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::5719918:4:::5511950:4:::5511950:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5414290:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5255134:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6850650:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6657747:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6723034:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6757811:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6853848:4:::6860331:4:::6860331:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6865146:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6850640:4:::6850640:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Clarks Shoe (Shop), Aylesbury::::Shopping::::40::::very helpful::::07.11.2010::::     Clarks is a reliable shoe company making good shoes in 1825, In Somerset brothers Cyrus and James Clark,  started the company by making slippers and other sheepskin products.My first experience that I can remember with a Clark   s shoe shop would be in the late 50   s. I can remember going into the St Ives shop and being terrified. To get a correct measurement on my feet I was asked to put my foot in a large box like machine that took pictures and sized my foot, I howled and howled I was not putting my foot in there. I can not clearly remember the event but I can remember being scared.Clarks measure your childrens feet for both length and width. I believe most Clarks have an x-ray machine for measuring feet similar to the one that spooked me when I was a child.As a child I nearly always had Clarks shoes .In the 50   s and 60   s Clarks shoes were considered to be the best for childrens feet   they still have a good reputation today. However being grown up now and having just recovered from a tendon injury I decided I wanted some shoes which were not trainers with gel soles. Still being precious about my feet and having a wide foot which is often too wide for a lot of shoes that have no width fittings I went to the Aylesbury Clarks shop.  This shop is situated just inside the entrance to Hale Leys just of the high street. Clark   s childrens shoes can also be bought in Mothercare. The shoes are displayed in the windows on the high street and in Hale leys as the shop is on the corner. This is not really a very large shop. Downstairs is the ladies shoes and gents shoes, the men   s is a smaller section. The childrens shoes are upstairs  There is no lift or escalator. I had a little look at the ladies shoes on display units in the shop as well as Clarks this shop also sell Kay   s shoes which are now a Clark   s brand. The shoes here are not the most exciting fashionable shoe   s they are sensible shoes saying that I think that some are quite attractive and certainly good to wear as a work shoe. In the Aylesbury shop there were a couple of assistants visible and as I sat myself down I asked one for some help. I described my problem feet and asked to try on several shoes in different sizes and width fittings all the same design. ( my foot size has changed and I do not need the orthopedic innersoles any longer) I wanted to be sure that I got the correct fitting.The assistant went into the store room at the end of the shop to find the shoes they had most of the sizes fittings that I requested to try. I was left on a fairly comfortable seat to try the shoes on, the assistant not too far away if I needed help. I tried on a couple of different styles of shoes. I soon found that my foot had increased from a 6 to a seven the seven smaller than the trainers I wear with innersoles. I stood up in the shoes and walked around the shop several times I found the E fitting too tight when I walked but the EE fitting good for me. I took ages trying on these shoes flexing my feet walking and sitting down then getting up and walking around the shop again. The assistant was understanding and considerate. Eventually I was happy with a pair. These shoes did not look like old ladies shoes like some of the others in the wider fitting.. I went to the counter and paid with a credit card, cash would have been acceptable too. Clark   s shoes are expensive as you would expect with leather and well designed shoes. I was asked if I wanted them in the box or not, I did as they are great for childrens model making or for storing things in. I was happy with my experience in the Aylesbury Clarks shop. But as I said they are sensible shoes some have moderate heels, but I shall be looking elsewhere for my killer high heels. Anyone know who makes size 7 EE fitting stilettos?     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5518667:4:::5518667:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6843584:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6861655:4:::6861655:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5092706:4:::5092706:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6862279:4:::6862279:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6825517:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6723034:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6757811:4:::6835564:4:::6835564:4:::5203100:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6840580:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Eco Force Recycled Clothes Pegs::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::06.11.2010::::    I recently was hanging out my washing and discovered some of my pegs broken, I really needed more so  when I went shopping  in Sainsbury   s I remembered that and bought a pack of 24 recycled plastic clothes pegs from EcoforceThese pegs come in a not very attractive green plastic bag. The pegs are green and yellow you can see them through the transparent window. I ripped open the bag threw it away and put the pegs in my peg bag. These pegs are made from 93  recycled plastic. They should last a long time they will not rot like wood they have no metal springs to come apart from the peg. They should not leave stains on clothing like some wooden ones have done on my clothing in the past.I have used these for several weeks now and although I shall try to peg my washing out, with the winter setting in I do not see myself using them so much. I think that as advertised these are quite strong and durable as I am sat here squeezing one open and it appears strong.  These pegs are made from one continuous piece of plastic. Pinching one end opens the other to grip the clothing on the washing line. Apparently the spring system won the design council millennium products award.These pegs were fairly easy to use to peg my washing onto my washing line. I find they grip firmly to the washing line when I take the washing in the clothes are still firmly attached to the line. If by any chance the pegs get dirty they can be washed in the washing machine or dishwasher.I bought my pack of 24 Eco force recycled pegs for    1.50 from Sainsbury   s This is about the same price of most retailers. On line I note these [pegs are available with a green recycled plastic peg bag with 23 pegs in costing    5.99 from http://www.caraselledirect.comPegging the washing out to dry is a good way to be green and save  money too. Yes I do own a tumble drier but try to use it only when necessary. It saves on my electricity bills. I listen to the weather forecast and do not do my washing unless essential on days that are going to be rainy. No need to make Monday your washing day. In the good old days (50/60s) my mum always washed on Monday as did a lot of other villagers.  I expect this is because they washed after the weekend and then got the best clothes dried and ironed ready by the next weekendApparently when the Mayflower came ashore in America it was a Monday and the women washed the clothes so the tradition taken to America.Washing clothes used to be more of a major event than it is now with modern washing machines and tumble driers. I just remember my Nan using a machine we called a boiler basically a tin tub that heated up water and Nan would occasionally agitate the clothes with a wooden stick. Then she would hang clothes to dry on the washing line strung out across the garden. Usually Nan washed by hand. I can not clearly remember what was in my house I think it was a    boiler    to begin with then the good old washer and tumble drier.The first electric washing machines were available in the late 19th century early 20th automatic washing machines in 1937.  The first tumble drier invented by Pochons a French Inventor in 1799.  This was just a basic drum that you placed near a fire and turned with a handle in the 1940   s the Electric tumble drier  was established however few homes had tumble driers . Tumble driers sensors for detecting the dryness of clothes were not really good till after 1960 of course machines have developed a lot since then. Thinking back to my own lifetime pre 1970 I have no knowledge of tumble driers. When I left home in 1972 I did use the laundrette and there were tumble driers there. As a young mother and housewife in 1975 I and all my friends did not have a tumble drier but by the 80   s a lot did now nearly everyone I know owns one.

       " \"5247778::::Merrell Women's Reactor Webwrap Sandal::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::03.11.2010::::    I have a pair of Merrell   s Reactor Webwrap sports sandals. I have had them for about 3 years now.If you have read my previous shoe/foot reviews you will be aware that until recently I have suffered with tendonitis and have suffered with painful walking for 3 years. I have tried and bought several different shoes trying to find the ones which are most comfortable. I have also been wearing specially made innersoles that the hospital provided. These sandals were quite comfortable to wear I was not pain free and these were not the best sandals that I have had that was a different pair of Merrell   s.However I found these quite comfortable and now I have no longer the problem with my feet that I used to get these sandal   s are really good.Sorry about going on about my feet but when I am reviewing a pair of shoes I felt I ought to explain as my review will obviously reflect my experience of their comfort. These women   s sandals are also available in a men   s fitting too.Let   s start with the sole these are a good thick sole that is still flexible. There are good grips on the sole. The inner sole is shaped to a foot shape this foot bed is microban antibacterial. There is an aircushion midsole.These sandals have a synthetic leather upper and two straps around the ankle and then one over the top of the instep.  The straps have a Hook and Loop closure system. The straps are adjustable and close with a Velcro strip. One of the reasons that I bought these sandal   s  was that the straps and not a plain black leather they are a grey slate fabric with a slightly darker design on then I thought that they would look more attractive  if I should  wear them with a skirt. To be honest they look ok with a skirt but not good as they are a basic flat walking sandalI have worn these sandals quite a lot. When my foot very painful I found them not as uncomfortable as some other sandals I also stuck the innersoles in them which helped more. I have worn these sandal   s to work, I have worn them out shopping I have worn them on holiday on walks in the countryside. They have fared well on both wet and dry land. These sandals are hard wearing and I expect to get at least another years wear out of them. When these have got really dirty I have put them in the washing machine to wash on a delicate cycle and they have come out fine. Otherwise I have cleaned the leather and polished with a black polish and just wiped the fabric strap with water, The RRP of these sandals is    40 Amazon is selling some for this price and some for    35 http://www.e-outdoor.co.uk are selling them for    33.95. Now this may sound a bit expensive but they are good comfortable sandals that wear well. Yes I would recommend them     ::::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6861309:3:::6861309:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5439461:3:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6145850:4:::6781956:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::5414290:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840580:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6864372:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5203100:4:::5790028:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::TRESemme Ceramic Styling Brush::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::01.11.2010::::    I have a TREsemme ceramic styling brush I must have had it for over 8 years now. I recently have been overhauling my hairbrushes and replacing those that need it. My TREsemme ceramic brush is one that does not really need replacing yet. It still does its job well. This brush is one I use daily my husband uses it too. It is a black brush the handle 11 cm long. There is a hole at the end of the handle so you can hang it on a hook or tread a ribbon through to hang it up by. In the centre of the handle there is a flat panel with the word tresemme printed on it. The handle has ridges either side of it this makes it easy to hold. Where the handle joins the head of the brush there is a silver white ring around it. The head of the brush is 5cm wide by 12 cm long. The plastic  quot;bristles  quot;of this hair brush are embedded in a rubbery sheet which is embedded in the head of the brush. If you push these bristles you will find there is an air space beneath them before the back of the head. According to Tresemme the bristles are ionic pins these are ceramic tipped. Looking at an individual bristle /pin they are about 1     cm long each one does have a rounded ball like tip , I guess this is what TREsemme describe as ceramic tipped. The pins are fairly widely spaced in 8 rows going along the length of the head of the brush. I like this hairbrush it brushes my long hair well. The pins go through my long locks giving it a thorough brush. This brush is easy to use and does a good job. I do not get frizz and my hair looks healthy and shiny after brushing. I use this brush to style and groom my hair very successfully. I do not often blow dry my hair but TREsemme says that the ceramic tips help retain heat as you blow dry. As I said my brush is at least 8 years old probably a lot older. Looking carefully at it I note it has one in missing and when new this was a shiny black brush but the outer layer seems mostly to have worn away however it is a matt black now. Yes the tresemme logo seems to have disappeared as well, however it looks fine for my daily use I only use it at home really, it s not for display. If I needed a new brush I would be happy to buy one of these again. I looked in Boots and it costs    5.99 I had a bit of a search on line at    5.99 is the usual selling price.      ::::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6757811:4:::5518667:4:::5518667:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6864372:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6844462:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6843584:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::3957:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6406995:4:::6406995:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6145850:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6863857:4:::6863857:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ravensburger In The Night Garden Playtray::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::31.10.2010::::    I was sorting the jigsaw puzzles out and came across this wooden In the night garden play tray, peg puzzle. This is made by Ravensburger who make many puzzlesThis puzzle is suitable for a child aged 2 and over, it is very simple. The puzzle measures 29.5cmx 21 cm. There are 6 insert pieces The wooden tray is natural wood coloured and has a  wavy blue stained  bottom edge this has small images of the night garden train  also in blue across the top edge of this area , over the rest of the wooden tray are a few pictures of flowers and the names of the characters. The shaped inset pieces are   Upsy daisy, Iggle piggle, Makka pakka and the Tomliboos there is also Pinky ponk and the house. These insert pictures look just like the pictures of these characters that your children will know. Underneath the insert pictures there is no duplicate picture to assist your child in positioning the piece. Each insert has a small yellow plastic peg centrally positioned this helps your child pick up and position the piece correctly on the play tray. This tray puzzle is good quality and well made. It should outlive 1 child   s interest and will still be in good condition when they progress to harder puzzles. In the night garden is quite a popular TV programme with tots and they will like doing this puzzle with the familiar characters. While they are doing this puzzle they are learning, practicing their fine motor skills and their manual dexterry, matching the shapes and developing their concentration.   Puzzles are a really good educational toy, these play trays with inserts ideal for the tiny tots. In the night garden was first shown on TV in 2007, I think this Ravensburger puzzle dates to sometime in 2008, so expect to see them still in good order in the charity shop  as well as on sale new  at many places including http://www.toysrus.co.uk where it  costs    7.99 http://www.debenhams.com have it on sale for    6,40.

This is a popular bag for a football fan as it is a circular fabric bag. The size of it is 22 cm h x 22 cm h x 8 cm. The front of this bag printed black and white just like a football. The back and the gusset is black. There is a zip which goes a long way around the bag but not completely. This zip is easy for a child to undo on their own. There is adequate room inside this bag for a packed lunch.  The one I know usually  contains sanswiches, fruit ,yoghurt and a mini sweet snack .A matching drinks canteen is available to go with this bag There is a handle on the top which is a good size for a child   s hand.  At the base of the bag there is  a  holder for a card to put your child   s name and class on. The bag has an insulating layer between the outer and the inner a wipe clean PVC free lining Wipe clean lining is important to wipe up spilt yoghurt and squashed banana.I think that this lunch bag should last the school year. I know a child who has been bringing this bag filled with his lunch into school everyday this term. and it has not faded and still in very good condition. There are so many lunch bags available now featuring different designs and characters. I know that the child who has this does like it, he is quit foot ball mad loves kicking the ball around and watching football on TV. I think this bag would work well as a useful Christmas present for a  5 , 6 , 7 year old maybe put some football cards or treats inside.      ::::5719918:3:::6824827:3:::6824827:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6005265:3:::6005265:3:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6847439:4:::6840580:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6690366:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6805327:4:::6805327:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Reeves Mini Scraperfoils::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::31.10.2010::::    I would like to recommend these small Reeves scraperfoils as little gifts for children aged over 8 years old. I intend getting some for gifts to some 8 year old girls. In the past I have done some Scraperfoils and so has my daughter Reeves make a selection of these in a postcard size 7 quot;x4.5 quot; that   s 17.8 x 11.4cm.A scraperboard is a thick board which is black on the top surface. There is a picture printed on top of this black surface. If you scratch this layer you will expose silver colour. So keep to the lines and you will get a silver engraving on the black board.  These mini Scraperfoils come in several designs they are just miniatures of the larger scraper boards. These mini Scraperboards come in a single pack  and includes one board and a small spare black piece of scrapper board to practice on and   a scraper    pen    tool .This tool  has a handle to make it easy to  hold, The scrapper blade    nib     is inserted into the end of the handle. To make your  scraper board picture you hold the handle of the scraperboard tool a bit like a  pen and use the blade/ nib end to scraper at the line that is imprinted on to the black  surface.  This is not difficult to do the difficult part for a child is keeping on the lines of the picture which have been printed on.  When the scraper board picture has been revealed it really does look attractive the silver outline picture shinning through the black. It does not really require much artistic skill to get that wonderful picture.  Just patience and the ability to keep on the line These pictures do look good on a Childs bedroom wall.These scraperboards have been around quite a few years now and when I looked on line I am sure some of the designs are the same. I especially remember the dolphin the rabbit and the polar bear. Most of the designs are animal ones. This mini scraperboard will cost about    1-   2 each. There is a lovely pig one I am thinking of getting for my friends daughter it costs    1.99 at Amazon. http://www.craftyarts.co.uk  has quite a large selection you can buy one for    1.48. You should be able to pick one of these up in the high street at a craft/art shop or even a large department store.I notice that there are also copper foils available which are the same as these scraperboards except with a copper instead of a silver colour to scrape into.Would I recommend? Yes I think these mini scraperboards would be ideal to take on holiday to keep your child busy or when you are making a boring visit somewhere.   These are a great size to pop in that birthday or Christmas card you are sending by post too.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6750576:3:::5719918:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6864027:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6855353:4:::6855353:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6690366:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6834688:4:::6850650:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6422123:4:::6422123:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6853604:4:::6853604:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5414290:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Party Mini Bubbles::::Family::::20::::very helpful::::30.10.2010::::    Tesco sells a pack of 4 small party bubbles like those in the category picture. These bubbles cost    1.50 for the 4 pack.. I am not sure how much liquid they contain but the bottles look about     the size of the larger bottles containing 118ml, the larger sized bottle is about the normal standard sized bottle of bubble mix. I bought the 118 ml bottle for 50p about a month ago.These bottles of bubble come in 4 colours red, yellow green or blue the label is rainbow coloured with the word PARTY on it. You can of course use these bubbles for any occasion it does not have to be a party. However a  bottle of these bubbles make an ideal  party bag content or a stocking filler , ideal for an outside party for the children to blow bubbles too .When you twist open the bottle lid there is a foil lid which has to be removed.I think that a parent might have to do this at least for under 5    s. These bubbles are suitable for over three year olds. Its a few months since I have used the mini bottles I can not remember what the wand that comes with them looks like but  the wand that comes with the larger bottle does not attach top the lid as some do. When the foil seal is removed you will have to delve just into the top of the bubble mix to retrieve this wand. My fingers are all sticky now with bubble mix as I have just done this. While I wrote this review I tried to blow several bubbles and my hand are very sticky yuck with bubble mix I certainly prefer the wands that are embedded in the lids of bubble mix.  The coloured plastic wand has a circular hole at one end this has ridges makes it easy to grip. The other end has a slightly bigger oval hole this does not have the ridges it is not so easy to grip. However either end is not difficult to hold and the aperture at each end is suitable for dipping in the bubble mix and will produce bubbles when blown by your child (or you).  So how good are the bubbles that are produced? Well to be honest I have just dipped the wand into the bubble mix about 10 times out of these only 4 dips produced bubbles when I gently blew through the wand and I only produced up to 4 bubbles each time. Waving the wand in the air did not produce better results.The Bubble Magic Bubbles Tub which I also have here and is also reviewed on dooyoo produces a better bubble    The bubbles from the party bottle are rainbow colour mostly blue green but other colours in the bubble too. Would I recommend these bubbles? Well they are ok certainly not the best. I have bought and used these with children previously and not received any moans from the children.Next time I buy bubbles if I have the option I shall buy a different brand. Bubbles are great fun for children. They are a good tool for language development.Use the bubbles to encourage your child to request more. You can use bubbles to help encourage eye contact. Blow bubbles for your child and wait for eye contact before blowing more. The act of blowing helps strengthen muscles for speech and make the right mouth shapes for the letters o, oo and w. Blowing bubbles will strengthen abdominal muscles You can teach your child sounds and words to the m and more, b and bubbles, p and pop.      ::::5646482:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::6655942:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6690366:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6422123:4:::6422123:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6785596:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6845479:4:::6845479:4:::6689426:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6859830:4:::6859830:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6853604:4:::6853604:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Halilit Sensory Balls::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::29.10.2010::::    I often use sensory balls at work. These ones are 4 inches/10 cm in diameter. They are available in blue, red, green or yellow. These balls are made of a strong yet soft rubbery plastic. They are balls covered in many knobbly spikes. These balls are squeezable. These balls are strong and durable will last many play hours. The five primary senses include: sight, sound, hearing, taste and touch. Babies and children learn and discover through their senses. Special needs children often have poorly developed senses. Sensory work also helps communication, by interesting your child with one of these balls they might eye point , look at them and at you showing a request for the ball again , they will turn towards or reach for the ball all of these pre verbal communication. These balls can be used to enhance fine and gross motor skills. These will also encourage socialisazation. These are some of the games I play with children and these balls. The balls are brightly coloured and I encourage children to stretch and reach for the balls, to walk, run or crawl to them. Reaching and picking the balls up hells to develop thier eye hand coordination. Also develops their muscles by grasping and squeezing and releasing the balls. Rolling the ball to the child and encouraging the child to roll the ball back, rolling and throwing to friends in the group. Many ball games can be played with these balls from simple catch games to games where your child throws the ball at a target, into a bucket. These balls are good for enhancing sensory stimulation, the texture feeling the hard knobbly bits and squeezing the soft rubber, use these balls in massage rolling them up the arms or legs.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Chocolate Chip Digestive Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::28.10.2010::::    I got back from Tesco   s about an hour ago, sat down with a cup of tea and now husband and I have nearly finished of a 400g pack of Tesco   s chocolate chip digestive biscuits. These biscuits cost me 65 p I think that   s a fair price. The biscuits come in a red packet with just the name on and a picture of a couple of the biscuits.As I think you can guess by the fact we have nearly demolished the entire pack between us we thought these biscuits tasty, they were very moreish. These are circular biscuits 7 cm in diameter they are     a cm thick. These biscuits do not contain nuts but cannot guarantee nut free they do contain wheat, Soya, gluten and milk.These biscuits are a golden brown with plenty of chocolate chips in them. I take a bite it is crunchy, crisp but not brittle. It is not a crumbly biscuit like some digestives. The taste is sweet and wheat, I like. I can just taste the chocolate but if you want a chocolate fix then choose a chocolate covered digestive not these as you do not really get the chocolate flavour its just very sweet, hubby just piped up its salty too. As you might expect with biscuits there are a lot of calories 493 kcal per 100g, as I have just scoffed nearly 20g half a packet I didn   t really want to know that, oh well I can always diet tomorrow. I just did a dunkability test and these biscuits held up well they stayed together the chochips just softening, better for dunking than a chocolate covered biscuit.  Yes I liked these biscuits and would recommend as an everyday biscuit (no not to eat a whole packet every day hubby, think how large my hips would get)       ::::5719918:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::6850636:3:::6785596:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6845273:3:::6845273:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6850650:4:::5690767:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6861309:4:::6861309:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::3957:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6781956:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840580:4:::5261772:4:::6797137:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6225648:4:::6853881:4:::6853881:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6654280:4:::6654280:4:::6830048:4:::6689426:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6778028:4:::6778028:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Briers Solemate Clogs::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::24.10.2010::::    The weather is wet the garden muddy, I do need to take the potato peelings down to the compost. I do not want to walk to the bottom of the garden in my slippers they will get filthy so I put on a pair of Briers garden clogs which I keep by the back door. These clogs are easy to slip onto my feet and then slip off again when I am back in the house. My clogs are pastel blue there are other colours available including lavender and candyfloss pink. They are available in sizes 4, 5 , 6 ,7 , and 8. I bought a size larger than my shoe size which although slightly loose are fine if I am wearing thick socks. These clogs are made of a water proof rubber fabric which is easy to clean. If mine get muddy I just rinse them off in water or wipe them over with a wet cloth. These clogs are not unattractive to look at. They do not have a flowery or spotty design on they are a uniform colour with the Briers logo on the side and centre front a shape moulded on which could be a flower of a tuft of grass. The soles of these garden clogs are black. The sole of these clogs is not smooth it has grips which prevent me sliding on the snow and ice should I wear these in the winter. The sides and the backs of these clogs are quite low but the front comes up quite high on my foot. Although fine for short grass and working on the soil when it is wet they are not ideal for long grass or mud. These clogs are not lines like some other garden shoes If I am doing some gardening in them I will wear socks to make them comfortable. These clogs are quite comfortable to wear. The sole is thick I have used these clogs while digging in the garden and I do not feel the spade or fork digging into my feet too much as I press down to dig the soil. These really are ideal when I want to pop into the garden to pick some vegetables. Or when I want to feed the birds. There is a removable rubbery innersole in this clop this innersole is soft and squashy. I must have had my blue clogs for over 5 years now and although they get worn often they are still in good condition I bought my clogs in a local shop but you can buy them on line at http://www.hardware-ironmongers. for    7,86 or from http://www.selections.com for    9.99. You will probably find these for sale in the garden centre or in a hardware shop. I am happy with my garden clogs I expect them to last several more years. Yes I would recommend. I prefer to wear these rather than a pair of wellies in the garden easier to put on and do not make my feet sweat so much. Briers make many gardeniong accesories and tools thier products quite good quality . I have seen other makes of gardening clogs these ones from Briers seem to be one of the least expensive.      ::::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6843584:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6723241:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6800944:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6785596:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6840580:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6830048:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6829986:4:::6829986:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Wader Summer & Garden - Fruits Moulds in a Net::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::25.10.2010::::    These   plastic Wader fruit sand moulds are really good. The fruits are strawberry, apple, pear, grape are available.  The colours that these fruit are made of are bright. The pears either red blue or green , the  apples  red, green or yellow , the  strawberries red, yellow or blue the grapes green, blue or yellow. The size of these fruit is from 11 cm to 14, 5 cm they are a good size for a child to fill with sand and make a good sized fruit mould. The shapes of these moulds are realistic and recognisable except that although Wader says one is a grape I think it looks more like a raspberry.  The apple and pear are both smooth plastic mould   s but the strawberry and the   grape    has marks that look like seeds.Used with wet sand these do make good sand moulds ideal for if you are doing a fruit / healthy eating type theme. The children I know spend ages playing in the sandpit filling these fruit moulds up with sand using either their hands or a toy spade, when the mould full they then turn the mould over   remove the plastic shape and reveal the fruit shape that they have made, depending on the child this shape then either gets bashed down or proudly saved until a friend knocks it down. I love sand play its owner of the basic play mediums your child learns a lot through sand play. These Wader fruit sand moulds are really good made of a good strong plastic that is durable will last a long time. You can either buy a set of 10 pieces of fruit for    5.49 or a set of 30 pieces of fruit for    15.99 from http://www.amazon.co.uk Wader is a German company that has been around since 12956 they make many plastic toys.Would I recommend ?

       " '5247778::::Playmobil 4705 Playmobil Soccer Player - Argentina::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.10.2010::::     I discovered this little Argentina football player in with all the other Playmobil people. This proud football player is the same height as the other Playmobil people   about 2 and     inch or 7.5 cm.  A little football just the right size for the Argentinean Playmobil footballer comes with this  toy/  This player  also  comes with a green stand  which you can place on the play football pitch  the  footballer can put his foot in position  on this and he will stand up and kick the ball   easily. He stands on his black football boots wearing long black football socks and black shorts. He wears the Argentine blue and white striped shirt with the team logo.This football player can wear a choice of numbers on his shirt as a sheet of sticky   numbers comes with him. This player has dark hair and those standard Playmobil features, dot eyes and smile. His head will twist from side to side so that he can see where the ball is and his arms with their claw like hands   move too. Move the little lever at the back of this player   s leg and this   Argentinean football player can move his right leg to enable him to kick the ball and score goals. This football player is quite agile he can bend, twist, and kick. The single [player is priced at    3.25 at http://www.playmobildirect.co.uk and at http://www.toyhub.co.uk/ also at http://www.spmodels.co.uk.Of course  he can not play football on his own so you might need to buy at least a 5 a side team. Playmobil sell toy football players of many different countries. Nets and other sets are also available.I think that this football player would make a great birthday cake topper   on a green iced cake. As well as playing on the toy football pitch this Playmobil Argentine player could get married to the Playmobil bride, go on holiday in the Playmobil caravan he can join in with all the other play people.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Chick Peas in Salted Water::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::18.10.2010::::    You can tell I am bored, its cold and raining   why else would I be writing a review on Tesco   s tinned chickpeas in salted water?I have a couple of the 400g tins in my store cupboard, will probably use one in the week. I just looked up the price at my supermarket and find that the 400g tin costs 48p that   s 12p per 100g and the smaller 220g tin costs 53 p that   s 24.1p per 100g surely that can not be right Mr Tesco , got your tins mixed up or something ?. The product is identical, the tin label the same except the cheaper one is in a larger tin. The use by date is usually a long time away so they are an ideal for a stand by in the cupboard.  Anyway these have a basic purple /blue label with a little pic of chickpeas, the words Tesco chick peas and the   nutritional info on. When I was a child in the late 50   s 6-60   s I did not know what a chick pea was. It is a pea species from the Mediterranean western Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Australia. I think the most commonly know food it is used in is hummus and they are used to make gram flour. I have used dried chickpeas before but it   s a drag you have to soak them for ages before you need them. I often use Tesco tinned chick peas in a casserole make the meat go further. There are many recipes where you can use chick peas see http://www.channel4.com   lots of recipes there.You need a tin opener to get into the tin no ring pull here. I pour mine into a colander to drain the salted water away. The drained weight is about 60  of the total weight looking at the chickpeas well they look fine all complete. So I just pour them into the casserole I am cooking and put it in the oven to cook. If you want to use these as a salad ingredient no need to cook, drain and rinse the chickpeas and add to other ingredients. The taste of chick peas can be called nutty, I do not like nuts and do not dislike chickpeas but usually I cook them with a flavoured sauce so their flavour not so strong. These beans are soft they are easy to mash for humus. Chick peas are healthy for you too; they are said to lower cholesterol. See http://www.professorshouse.com for lots of info Would I recommend these Tesco chickpeas? Yes     ::::6860710:3:::6860710:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6723241:3:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6406995:4:::6406995:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5499901:4:::5499901:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6701923:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::3957:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6689426:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5414290:4:::6759284:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6855072:4:::6855072:4:::6840580:4:::6462090:4:::6462090:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6816341:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6858056:4:::6858056:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio Pull Along Duck::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.10.2010::::    Brio is a company that makes great wooden toys. This wooden pull along duck is no exception. I have been playing with this duck recently, alongside a child of course. This wooden duck is suitable for a child aged one year old and over. Pulling the duck behind will give your child the incentive to walk and take some of those first few wobbly steps, helping him/her gain coordination and balance. This duck will nod his head when he moves, his wings will flap and he will also Quack also quack. As well as pulling this duck along behind your tot will enjoy sitting on the floor and pulling this duck along watching it  nod its head flap its wings and making the sound we can loosely call quacking.   This duck is ideal for both play inside or outside on the patio or garden path, yes it will fall over on uneven ground. Your tot could always take this duck on a visit to the shops or to the park, mind you I bet you will end up carrying it for them.  I ended carrying the duck on our way back from the shop.  This duck measuring H13.8 x W16.9 x D 8.6 cm is a good solid toy. The duck is white with yellow wings and yellow beak.  The duck has an eye and eyebrow stained on. There are 4 red wheels and he has a red collar /neck. On his breast BRIO is written in black. A string is attached to his breast just below the word.  This duck is easy to pull along, the wheels turning smoothly. This really is a cute wooden duck. It is very durable should outlive one or two childrens fascination with him. I would recommend for a child aged between 1 and two years old an older child might like this duck too.You can buy this duck for    9.99 at http://www.johnlewis.com  on or off line     ::::5719918:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6852098:3:::6852098:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5414290:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6145850:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6844462:4:::6693128:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5805376:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6858056:4:::6858056:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6689426:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5347743:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Grottes de Lacave, Lacave::::Travel::::40::::helpful::::08.09.2010::::    This summer we were travelling through France to the Pyrenees We traveled north to south on the A20 Lacave is just a few miles east of this road which was ideal as we did not wish to stop too far from our route. Before we started our travels I looked on the internet for a suitable place to stop and found Lacave. Lacave is in the Gourdon, Lot, Midi-Pyrenees, France; its geographical coordinates are 44    51  0 quot; North, 1    34  0 quot; East.   . We camped for 2 nights in this area as we had decided there were a couple of places we would like to see.  The Dordogne is well known for its caves and cave paintings; we have visited other caves in the area in previous years   and decided to visit the Caves at Lacave. These caves were not very noticeable from the road. We parked in a small car park opposite the entrance to the cave next to the farmers market. There was a small shop, / ticket office next to the entrance. The cost to go into the cave was 8 euros for adults and 5.20 E for children aged 5 -14 years old. We waited at the entrance for the small train that takes you through a 600m long tunnel to the depths of the cave. When we got out of the train it was a guided tour of about 1 2/2 km. This guided visit was in French and since my understanding is limited I did not try to   translate but just enjoyed the features. Some of these features were   fenced in to prevent visitors touching and destroying them.  There were several galleries with stalactites and stalagmites and rock formations, which if you use your imagination do look like animals.Walking in these caves was not too difficult. Our visit to the cave was about an hour long maybe just a little longer.If you want a tour through these caves then someone has put a video on www.youtube.com there are one or two other sites with information too.Would I recommend?

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Country Cottage::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.10.2010::::    Little Tikes an American company was founded in 1970, in 2006 it became part of MGA entertainment group which includes other toy manufacturers.Little tikes make many childrens toys which are suitable for both home and child care settings. Working in a school we have several little tikes    product   s, one is the Little Tikes country cottage Childrens Playhouse that is shown here. This playhouse is usually known as the Little Tikes Evergreen Country Cottage. Little Tikes make several similar cottages with different colour schemes.However, this Plastic cottage has green walls these are marked to make them look as if they might be green planks of wood. The roof of this cottage playhouse is red. This house has 4 windows the surrounds of which are yellow; the windows each have 2 yellow shutters too. The windows are open windows with no substitute for glass in them.  These windows are large enough for a small child to climb through especially if they have a chair or something to climb onto too. The door which is nearly the full height of the house is yellow too. Inside this house is a pretend sink unit with a swivel tap. There is also a pretend stove top that has some knobs which click when turned. There is also a play phone with push buttons. Children enjoy playing in this house pretending to make dinner or cups of tea. There is only room for 2 children possibly 3 to play inside this house. We provide the children with a few extra houses play props such as a tea set, some pretend food, a doll. Although a small play chair will fit inside the house it leaves no room for play so   in the warm weather we put a small chair and table outside the house to extend the play opportunities. This house measures height - 130cm  width - 135cm depth - 115cm it is suitable for children aged between about 2 and 6 years oldThe children that I see playing in this house certainly enjoy it. All children love a playhouse somewhere of there own. This house is suitable for outdoor or indoor use  The house is made of a strong molded plastic and is very durable. When it gets dirty it is fairly easy to clean with hot water and soap powder.The RRP of this house is 279.99, it is on sale at Tesco   s  too .I notice eBay has several second hand for sale. I think that if you buy one second hand its condition will still be fine, the plastic maybe a little faded.  This is a toy that lasts several years in nursery schools with a lot of use so is strong and wears well. Would I recommend? Yes, it   s good for imaginary role play.Personally I think that  if you have enough space in your garden that a wooden shed with windows would make a great playhouse then you could utilise it as a  gardenshed  or summer house to sit in when the kids grow up a bit.. A much more attractive option than these garish plastic houses.  however  small children do like these little  tikes houses.     ::::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5790028:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6750576:3:::5633146:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5347743:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6855417:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5414290:4:::5719918:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6145850:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::6657747:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6845780:4:::6845780:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6757811:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6524016:4:::6524016:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6840580:4:::6785596:4:::6462090:4:::6462090:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6800944:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6859676:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pintoy Stacking Hen Wooden Toy::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.10.2010::::    This Pintoy  stacking hen is one I have played with alongside special needs children , it is an ideal toy for a child aged over 1 year old. This toy is a fairly basic stacking ring toy.  The stacking toy has a circular natural wooden base diameter approx 135 mm /51/2 in. This base has a central rod rising to about 150 mm / 6 quot;. There are 5 coloured rings that fit onto the rod. The sizes of these are graded the largest to position at the base is a dark red , the others in different shades of red and orange till you get to the smallest disc which is yellow. When completed with the rings in graded sizes from largest at bottom to smallest at top they form a cone. There is still a little bit of the central rod sticking out of the top of this cone, to finish of there is a white wooden rounded hens head. When completed this is quite an attractive toy. The children that I know enjoy making the hen.The RRP of this hen is    13.99You can buy this stacking hen at http://www.amazon.co.uk for    12. 73 its    10.98 from http://www.toysbymailorder.co.uk. Stacking toys are a good toy for a baby, this hen a fairly simple one. Baby at one will remove the rings from the cone and will just be able to replace some on the rod. Baby will be practicing   fine motor skills.  You will need to give your child each ring to get him/her to put them on in the right order at first Remember too talk and praise your tot. At one year old naming colours will not mean a great deal to baby but name them anyway get baby used to the words, A child will learn through repetition, At 2 year   s old they will be getting the idea of colours. When your tot is over 2 he/she will also be beginning to differentiate the sizes, big and small, soon they will be able to stack these rings onto the hen in the correct graded size order.So by three with coordination the fine motor skills, the colour and size recognition your child has learnt. They should be able to do complete this stacking hen fairly easily and by 4 years old ready to give this toy away to a younger child because they have outgrown it.  This toy does not take long for a child to do which is good as a small tot only has a short attention span. Do remember to praise your child when they correctly position the rings.All the ages I have given are approximate as we all know children mature at different rates. Would I recommend this toy? Yes it   s a good one. Pintoy are a company from Thailand   they use rubberwood to make toys from trees from Latex plantations. The trees no longer producing latex are cut and the wood used for these toys. I think this is a good environment friendly way as the trees will be replaced by more rubber trees.     ::::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6860710:4:::6860710:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6844462:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5414290:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::3957:4:::6834619:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6689426:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5347743:4:::6657747:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::6816341:4:::6840580:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::6850650:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6292077:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco_Digestive_Biscuits_::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::12.10.2010::::    I do like a digestive biscuit and often shop in Tesco   s so will sometimes buy the Tesco   s own brand  sometimes I buy a value pack  these are acceptable sometimes I buy the regular Tesco 500g pack this comes in a read package. These round biscuits   with little holes dotted on them go well with a cup of tea.  They are not too crumbly so do use a plate to catch crumbs in the sitting room.  They are not quite as buttery and tasty as a branded biscuit and maybe marginally better than the Tesco value ones. Digestives are a good plain flavoured biscuit maybe a bit boring for some.  Not only are these a sweet biscuit snack but they can be good as an accompaniment for cheese. I have sometimes used these biscuits all crumbled up to make a cheese cake base and for those Chocolate Refrigerator Squares and many other recipes using digestive biscuits http://www.bbc.co.uk is a source of recipes.These biscuits are not too expensive at 52p per packet. Each biscuit has 80 kcal that 485 per 100g. If you have allergies no doubt you will check ingredients   these do contain wheat and milk they might also have nut in them.

       " '5247778::::Henbrandt Groan Tube::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::10.10.2010::::    It s a narrow about 2.54 cm /1inch wide 40 cm/16 inches long hollow plastic tube. You can have a colour choice there are neon colours green, blue, and purple orange. Interesting isn t it? That s right pick it up it s a smooth plastic , now twist your hand and tip the tube up so the tube is vertical that s right ohh hear that groan oh you are turning the tube over again its groaning again. What an irritating noise oh you are doing it again, that sound is not musical it s not pleasant like a rain stick, sounds like a cow with belly ache. Or my husbands stomach after eating a curry. I think these tubes have something inside which slides down when tipped and it makes the noise. Much as this noise is irritating and infuriating its irresistible , I bet if you had one of these tubes put in front of you, you would not be able to resist tipping it several times . We use these tubes at work to motivate the children to grip to move and twist their wrists. , we use them to get the childrens attention, to get them to look in the right direction for the noise and to follow it. Also these would be good for a group asking the children what makes them groan and get them to try and make the noise. I work with special needs children. One of these groan tubes would make a splendid stocking filler or for the party loot bag. .

       " '5247778::::Tesco Iced Fairy Cakes::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::07.10.2010::::    I have eaten several of these Tesco iced fairy cakes at childrens parties.I think they are an ideal little cake for a child   s party if you can not be bothered to make your own. These cakes from Tesco   s come in a pack of 12. They come in a clear packaging so you can see the little cakes.  They do not look very exciting, they look basic. These little individual sized cakes are a plain sponge cake, they each come in a little paper case. Each of these little fairy cakes has a small circular blob of icing on top .   There are 4 with pink slightly strawberry flavoured icing on top. 4 with yellow coloured lemon flavoured icing and 4 with plain icing on.These cakes do not look exciting to an adult but I think to a young child they look good.These cakes are not very crumbly when you bite them, they are not too dry.  The cake itself is a reasonable texture. It tastes a plain taste inoffensive, mild, bland but sweet. The icing on the top tastes sweet of course you can just taste the lemon and the strawberry flavour of the icing.So these are really a basic little fairy cake which is good enough but not great. However they are fairly cheap they only cost 99p for the pack of 12.  When serving these I have to be aware that they do contain wheat flour, eggs, and dried skimmed milk some people might have allergies to these. Tesco says although there are no nuts in these they can not guarantee them nut free, Would I recommend these cakes ? Well yes if you just want a basic cake , nothing special.     ::::3957:3:::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6855072:3:::6855072:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6700902:3:::6700902:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6846862:3:::6846862:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6657747:3:::5439461:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5719918:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6858056:4:::6858056:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5690767:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5347743:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6860317:4:::6860317:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6743627:4:::6743627:4:::6689426:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6785596:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6145850:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6855353:4:::6855353:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5790028:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Learning Resources Frog Life Cycle Stamp::::Family::::40::::helpful::::05.10.2010::::     I used these  frog life cycle stamps last term well I used a couple of them as although there is a pack of 4 egg, tadpole, tadpole with legs 2 of the set seem to have disappeared somewhere.It will not be very long really till its spring and frogs are spawning so I thought I would tell you about these just in case you wanted some resources. These ink stamps come in 4 sizes from 2 1/2cm x 2 1/2cm to 13cm x 7 1/2cm.  The largest stamp is the frog the smallest the eggs. These stamps are made of rubber. The pictures that the stamps leave are really good clear real life images. The lines quite fine the images detailed. They are ideal for illustrating work about frogs, or just for art work. I do not think this set comes with an ink pad, but I may be wrong. The base of the stamp with the picture is attached to a thick shaped plastic block  this is shaped to make it easy to hold. I found using the frog stamp myself I did not get messy hands. It was easy to stamp the picture on paper and remove the stamp without smudging the edges. The children had a little more trouble but not much. Apparently these frog stamps come in a plastic storage case, I did not see this as it has got mislaid. These Frog life cycle stamps from Learning resources cost    6.50 from http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk Would I recommend ?

       " '5247778::::Galt  Glue Spreaders::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::04.10.2010::::     I am sure you will not want a box of 48 glue spreaders , unless you are a  school or nursery , galt online are selling them in this quantity . I bet if you go to a galt shop you will be able to buy packs with less spreaders in. The pack of 48 glue spreaders only cost    2.50 . These glue spreaders are for children to use to spread glue on their art and craft, ideal for foundation and key stage 1 and 2 children. These spreaders can be blue or white. They are made of plastic and are suitable for children as soon as they want to stick and glue. These glue spreaders have a thin cylinder shaft about 1/2cm in radius about 10 or 11 cm long. this then flattens out to a flat ended blade this is 60 mm wide and just a little longer than that. These are not the similar glue spreaders which have a collar at the join of the blade and stem of the spreader. The shaft handles are easy to grip and the plastic is firm. The blade where the plastic thinner is more pliable, softer it flexes a little and bends when pressed down. Dip the blade into glue and then spread it onto paper to stick to make collages or depending on the glue used it can be used to stick  quot;junk quot; models together can be used to stick glue onto fabrics too These glue stickers are quite easy to use, they last a long time. Personally I prefer the ones with a collar on that come in different colours too as the blade are softer more pliable.      ::::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5663726:3:::5663726:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6852684:3:::6852684:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5306962:3:::5306962:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6843584:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5578305:3:::5578305:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6858056:4:::6858056:4:::6859651:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5414290:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6735325:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5347743:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6853014:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::3957:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Lasagne Sheets::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::02.10.2010::::    I made a lasagne the other day and used Tesco   s value lasagne sheets with a pretty standard Bolognese sauce that I made from scratch. I choose Tesco   s value lasagne because it was cheap 30 p for 250g. Tesco   s standard lasagne costs 75p for 250g. For those with some allergies note it contains Durum wheat semolina, Gluten   Wheat This value lasagne comes in a basic white card box with red writing. The lasagne pasta is a yellowish white colour. It is a reasonable thickness it is hard and can be brittle. This is  a lasagne that you can precook  in a pan of boiling water for a few minutes, some people say you do not need to if you make sure it is covered well in sauce  , but I find it  a bit dry if I do not precook for about 5 minutes.I shall not write a lasagne recipe here, lasagne basically is a dish made of alternating layers of lasagna pasta, tomato Bolognese sauce and a b   chamel cheese sauce. Lasagne can be made with a meat or vegetarian sauce I make a spinach one that is nice. See http://southernfood.about.com/od/lasagnarecipes  there are many different recipe   s here  This lasagna pasta makes a good lasagne cooks well and tastes fine. Lasagne pasta is a fairly bland tastes anyway the flavour being in the sauce. When the lasagne and meat sauce has been precooked and the lasagne made up it needs about 30 to 45 minutes in the oven at 325 or gas mark 3. There are 12 lasagne sheets in a packet a pack of these sheets usually makes a lasagne big enough for 6 people.  50g which is 2 sheets contains 171 kcal. I usually make up a large batch for the twop of us and freeze  that which we do not use for a work night when I cannot bre bothered to cook. This lasagne is in my opinion a good saving taste as good as the other plain pastas on the market.     ::::6796380:3:::6796380:3:::6852684:3:::6852684:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6239064:3:::6239064:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6820455:3:::6750576:3:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6831737:4:::6831737:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5719918:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6800944:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6653294:4:::6653294:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5414290:4:::5347743:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6840580:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6657747:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6832611:4:::5805660:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This is a square simple lift out puzzle with 4 pieces.  The square wooden puzzle tray has shaped pieces cut out of it. The pieces are an ant, a bee, a caterpillar and a spider. Each of these pieces is chunky and shaped to fit the corresponding space in the puzzle tray. Each coloured lift out piece has a  little wooden peg  this makes  it easy for the child to remove and replace the puzzle piece in the correct place , good as well as it is getting your child to use that pincer grip needed for writing . The bug pieces are not life like, they are all friendly images they all have a smile on their faces.  All of the lifts out bugs have a small area of   tactile fabric on them. The Ant is red brown and does have 6 legs and antennae. On its carapace it has a small area of coloured tactile fabric for your child to feel. Underneath where the ant piece fits there is an identical picture of the ant however it does not have the tactile are. The   Bee puzzle piece is a happy smiling blue and yellow bumble bee with a tactile wing. The caterpillar is a cute little red and orange caterpillar with yellow feet.  He has a tactile feely piece on his body.  Now the green spider has a blue tactile panel on his body. The spider has a green smiley face and 8 legs each with a blue foot. The positions which these pieces fit into in the [puzzle board are the same shape as the puzzle pieces and they have an identical picture of the bug which fits there except they do not have the tactile area. The colours are bright and attractive. These puzzles are suitable for children aged over 9 months old. I like this puzzle I have used it with special needs children.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Sterile Blister Plasters::::Health::::40::::very helpful::::30.09.2010::::    I wore a new pair of shoes and walked too far in them and I had a couple of blisters on my heels. I was in shopping and bought some Tesco Sterile Blister Plasters these cost    1.54 for a packet of 6 in comparison to    4.09 for compeed sterile blister plasters.These plasters contained in a card box are individually wrapped .they are an oval shape. The plasters are translucent not skin colored.  They are very thin. Tesco tells us they are suitable for sensitive skin. I removed the protective wrapping put one on the blister on my foot it went on well. This plaster was comfortable the sides of it did not curl up. These plasters are breathable and flexible. These blister plasters are also waterproof. I do not know how they would withstand a long soaking but I have showered several times with one on and it has remained firmly stuckThese plasters have Hydrocolloid particles and apparently these particles react with the skin to make a white gel over the blister this stops hard scabs forming and speeds healing. My blisters were on the side of my foot and I think that the plasters did not rub and come of when I was wearing my shoes as some other plasters do. I do not have sensitive skin but Tesco says they feature a Hypoallergenic adhesive so are suitable for sensitive skin.I hate blisters on my feet that rub against the heel or straps of sandals I find these plasters good apparently if you have an area which tends to blister these are good as a protective layer to stop a blister forming.

I have now reached the grandparent stage of life and my friend   s children are having grandchildren too. We do not all buy presents for each others grandchildren, but there are exceptions. I bought the Brio helicopter for one of my friends grandchildren.   This Brio Helicopter has been available for several years now and I have seen it and played alongside children while they play with it. A pull along toy is a classic toy toddlers have enjoyed pulling toys along behind themselves forever. This helicopter was received by    Johnny    (not his real name) aged 20 months with pleasure. This toy is suitable for children aged over 18/ 19 months. After Johnny had torn open the wrapping   s and played with them a bit he said copter and started to push and pull it around turning the wheels, twirling the helicopter blades with his hand. After some encouragement and being shown how to by the adults Johnny stood up and pulled his new copter across the floor,  the  blades twirling   as he walked and pulled it along .He continued to play with it for quite a time. I have seen these friends since and noticed Johnny playing with the helicopter. The blades go faster and faster the faster he walks or pulls it. This Brio helicopter is a wooden toy coloured green.  It is 15 cm long and 10 cm long and 10 cm high. Inside the helicopter is a little orange person who can not be removed. Attached to the front is a yellow string that your child can grasp to pull the helicopter along. This toy is good for encouraging a child to walk, good for their developing imaginations.  This toy should last a long time it   s very sturdy, it may get knocked about a bit but should still work well. Brio make quality toys I would never hesitate in recommending   Brio started in 1884 with a basket maker Ivar Bengtsson.  It is now a global corporation making wooden toys.This helicopter is available from http://www.amazon.co.uk for    7.99 the RRP is    14.99http://www.activetoy.co.uk are selling it for    9.99     ::::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5646482:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6844462:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5414290:4:::3957:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5719918:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6843584:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6462090:4:::6462090:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::5805660:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5820186:4:::5820186:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::6853014:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5347743:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6785596:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::SuperCook Blue Food Colouring::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::27.09.2010::::    Dr Oetker  a German run food group bought Supercook  which was a Yorkshire company based in Leeds in 2007.  This blue food colouring  is the same as it was with supercook  just a slightly different label on the bottle now.  I had run out of food colourings and we had several birthdays in August and September so I bought a few basic colours from Tesco one was the Dr Oetker blue colouring it costs 52p for a 38ml bottle. I price checked just now and ASDA natural Blue Food colouring  cost  63p for 38ml I checked out Ocado and they sell Langdale Blue Food colouring  33p for 28ml the Langdale works out the cheaper .Anyway back to the Dr Oetker blue colouring.  Dr Oetker took over supercook this year and now all the baking products are relabeled This blue colouring comes in a small clear plastic bottle with a red lid. Twist the cap to break the seal that attaches the lid to the bottle. The liquid looks a very dark blue. It is best to add this colour only a few drops at a time. I added a  couple of drops to my icing that I had made up  if you want a  darker blue just add a few drips of blue colouring till you achieve the  colour you want . This way you can get either a pale sky blue or a darker blue colour. Stir this colour into your icing well to get an even colour. You can colour mix by adding yellow  to make green colour , I generally do this   I buy yellow, blue and red   food coloring  and if I should want green or  purple I add either yellow or  red. This is a good activity for children to do for colour combining. You can add food colouring and mix it straight in for an even colour or alternatively  ice your cake white then  very, very carefully  make a spiral line of  colouring through a food dropper and then  make lines across the icing with a knife or fork to make a cobweb pattern. You can also paint a picture on the iced cake with a thin clean paintbrush dipped into the blue colouring.  I have another use for Dr Oetker blue food colouring too. I make up some home made playdough and add  a few drops of food colouring to it The  food colouring needs to be kneaded in to the dough well.The colour produced by this food colouring is good, it is easy to use, just be careful you only add a small drop at a time, you can of course always rescue a too blue   colour by adding more white icing sugar. Dr Oetker says there are no allergens in this colouring and it is suitable for vegetarians I     ::::5646482:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5414290:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5719918:4:::6609678:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6101464:4:::6101464:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::6854841:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6743627:4:::6743627:4:::6723241:4:::6800944:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6657747:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6701923:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6844462:4:::6378505:4:::5820186:4:::5820186:4:::6781956:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5578305:4:::5578305:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galt Velour Playmat::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.09.2010::::    This playmat that we have in the nursery department is from Galt. This mat is suitable from birth It is made from lovely soft velour. This mat is washable. It measures about 80x80cm The colours which are used are bright and cheerful attractive to a young baby. This mat has an outer edging of red velour then the mat features 4 animals each in their own corner square of the mat. In the yellow corner is the horses head this is a two coloured head  blue at the top then red it also has a few tufts of green hair at the top of its head. The ears of the horse attached at the head but then the fabric is not fixed down. You baby can then fondle and feel the ears texture. The ears crinkle. Next to the horse in the pale blue corner is the cow. The cow again is sectioned the lower part of its head is pink with a black mouth and nostrils sewn on. The cow has a white face with a black eye patch his black ears again attached at the head are flapping free.  His ears also crinkle this cow has 2 little yellow horns and has a purple flower fitted to his head. Now in the green corner it   s the purple sheep   s head. This is one colour with black features and again those flappy ears. Between his ears is a white 5 petalled flower. Now in the purple corner is Mr Pig. Pink pig face with black markings for eyes and mouth and pig has those pink ears attached they crinkle like the others. Now Mr Pig   s nose is oval it   s raised and if baby rolls over or squeezes his nose and it squeaks   This is a comfortable mat for a small baby to lie on. Baby will enjoy finding the ears and feeling them making them crinkle. The main attraction is the squeaky pig   s nose babies will laugh when it squeaks. This mat at 80cm square is a bit small for lots of adventure. I think its good for when you have a small baby that you want to put on the floor. This mat squashes up well into a clear plastic bag measuring    35.6 x 10.2 x 35.6 cm so it is ideal for taking with you when visiting.

       " '5247778::::ELC lift out textured puzzle::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::25.09.2010::::    We are encouraging children to touch and feel the bugs in this jigsaw puzzle from the ELC . This is a square simple lift out puzzle with 4 pieces.  The square wooden puzzle tray has shaped pieces cut out of it. The pieces are an ant, a bee, a caterpillar and a spider. Each of these pieces is chunky and shaped to fit the corresponding space in the puzzle tray. Each coloured lift out piece has a  little wooden peg  this makes  it easy for the child to remove and replace the puzzle piece in the correct place , good as well as it is getting your child to use that pincer grip needed for writing . The bug pieces are not life like, they are all friendly images they all have a smile on their faces.  All of the lifts out bugs have a small area of   tactile fabric on them. The Ant is red brown and does have 6 legs and antennae. On its carapace it has a small area of coloured tactile fabric for your child to feel. Underneath where the ant piece fits there is an identical picture of the ant however it does not have the tactile are. The   Bee puzzle piece is a happy smiling blue and yellow bumble bee with a tactile wing. The caterpillar is a cute little red and orange caterpillar with yellow feet.  He has a tactile feely piece on his body.  Now the green spider has a blue tactile panel on his body. The spider has a green smiley face and 8 legs each with a blue foot. The positions which these pieces fit into in the [puzzle board are the same shape as the puzzle pieces and they have an identical picture of the bug which fits there except they do not have the tactile area. The colours are bright and attractive. These puzzles are suitable for children aged over 9 months old. I like this puzzle I have used it with special needs children.  This ELC touch and feel lift out puzzle is good to help your child develop their motor control movements. Good for developing their spatial awareness. It is a good way to encourage a child to sit and concentrate this puzzle should not take very long to do. This puzzle would be good for helping your child learn the names of these insects talk to your child while they are doing the puzzle talk about the colours and the bugs. This puzzle will cost you    5.00 from the early learning centre http://www.elc.co.uk or mother care http://www.mothercare.com . Mother care bought the early learning centre in 20007.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Sultana Scones::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::24.09.2010::::    Do you fancy a cheap fruit scone? Then these value ones at Tesco are only 3,3p each there is 10 in a pack the pack costs 33p.  I notice Asda cheap sultana scones are the same price.I usually make my own scones, but have on occasion bought these also have eaten them at work when someone has bought them in.These scones are a very good price I would not be able to make them at home so cheaply. Scones are in fact quick and easy to make at home and mine do actually taste better than these from Tesco. These are round scones each one a good size.  These scones are slightly nicer if warmed in the microwave for a minute or two not too long or they will go solid. Now to serve these scones cut them in half, the outer    crust    is dry the inner moist, you will notice the texture quite good a little crumbly but not too much so. There are a few raisins in each piece of scone, not as many as in my home made ones but nearly enough (these are v cheap value scones after all). Now how do you eat your fruit scones spread with butter or some other fatty spread? I do not feel the need for anything else but some people do I know so jam, cream, anything you fancy.So how do they taste?  Very pleasant quite a neutral sweet taste the fruit is fairly plump adds that extra sweet ness to a bite.  I would not be embarrassed to serve these to a friend with a cup of tea or coffee they obviously are not the finest or my home made ones but they are good enough. If I am shopping straight after work I am often in need of a sugar fix so I might buy these and take home to eat with that much needed cup of tea. Calories  there are 332kcal in 100g  now I am not sure how much each one weighs but Tesco tells me in 40g there are 133kcal so I guess that 1 scone is about 40g why else would they use that figure .  For those people with allergies these scones do contain gluten, wheat and milk  and  may  contain nuts and sesame seeds, I guess they are prepared in factory where these are used in other products .     ::::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::5414290:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5261772:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6830048:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6562051:4:::6562051:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6378505:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6797951:4:::6797951:4:::5255134:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6524016:4:::6524016:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This is a curious ball you just cannot resist picking it up and squeezing a few times. Another curios thing is that when squeezed the colour of the pustules is not the colour that you might imagine from the colour ball However if it is squished and squashed too hard you might find that the rubbery ball splits and the gel oozes out everywhereI have used it as a motivator to get children to move and squeeze their fingers and hands. It could be a good novelty toy for a child in a Christmas stocking or a good adult fiddle toyThis squishy mesh ball is not suitable for fewer than threes really. This ball is available at Hawkins sorts and other novelty toy shops it is available in several different colours some are orange, green, or red. This ball costs    2.00 from http://www.hawkin.com and from    1.49 from http://www.hawkin.com     ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5499901:3:::5499901:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6840580:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6723241:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6852684:3:::6852684:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5414290:4:::6101464:4:::6101464:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6855417:4:::5820186:4:::5820186:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6145850:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6856387:4:::6856387:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5840413:4:::5840413:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6745849:4:::6745849:4:::6292077:4:::6816341:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::TREsemme Detangling Comb::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::21.09.2010::::    I must have had this TREsemme detangle comb for about 18 months now. If you buy it at Boots today it coasts    2.99. This black comb is quite a long one with a flat but wide handle which is good to grasp while I am combing and detangling my hair. The teeth on this comb are long too and they are widely spaced out. The length of this comb is 225mm I comb my hair when it is wet rather than brushing it, as we are always told a comb will do less damage to the hair. I comb my wet hair from roots to tips. This Tresemme comb goes through my thick long hair quite well. I use it to tease out the knots that form by combing my hair from just above the tangle to the ends. I comb gently and carefully so not to break my hair.After combing and when my hair is dry I use a brush.This comb is also ideal for combing in conditioner and hair dye to make sure it   s evenly spread. This comb is good for long or short hair my husband uses it sometimes. I use it to style my long hair and he his short hair. This comb is made out plastic, I find it comfortable on my hair, does not pull. The Tresemme detangling comb is quite strong although I have broken the end tooth of my comb through force when it got stuck in a   door hinge; however this comb is still usable. Would I recommend? Yes it   s a good comb. Its possible to buy this comb at other retailers other than Boots   my local chemist stocks them as do many places on the internet.     ::::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5820186:3:::5820186:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6657747:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6850650:3:::6752066:3:::6752066:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6750576:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5817960:4:::5817960:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::3957:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6378505:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6855417:4:::6701923:4:::6854841:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6800944:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6462090:4:::6462090:4:::6830048:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6816341:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Schwartz Garlic Granules::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.09.2010::::    I use and like garlic in recipes, I usually buy a fresh garlic bulb and crush and use the cloves to add to my dishes. As well as fresh garlic which I do prefer I also have a glass jar of Swartz garlic granules in my store cupboard. I use these granules when I run out of real garlic.These garlic granules from Schwartz come in an attractive glass jar containing 47g or you can buy a 47g refill packet. The glass jar cost    1.41 at Tesco the refill pack costs    1.33. A pack of 3 organic garlic bulbs cost 79p.A jar of this granulated garlic will store successfully for several months making it more economical than real garlic if you only use it occasionally. As the name suggests this jar contains dried granules of garlic. The garlic granules are very small smaller than a grain of sand. There is nothing added to this garlic so ideal to use instead of garlic salt if you are worried about salt intake.   tsp of this is equivalent to 1 fresh clove. I have used it to make many dishes that require a little garlic I have blended about a teaspoonful with 100g of butter and added some chopped parsley spread on a slices French stick and warmed to make garlic bread to accompany soup. I have also made garlic mushrooms by lightly cooking mushrooms in the garlic butter till they are soft, they go well with chicken or steak or used as a starter.I have sprinkled some over potatoes before roasting this makes them flavorsome. These garlic granules can be used in any recipie requiring garlic.Using this garlic is much easier than peeling the skin of a clove of garlic chopping or putting it through the garlic press. My fingers do not get so smelly when using the garlic granules either. Yes these are a handy garlic to have.       ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6391230:3:::6391230:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6785596:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5719918:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5646482:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6820455:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::3957:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6830048:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Fondant Icing White Ready Ice::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.09.2010::::     As you may have guessed from my recent reviews I have several family birthday   s  from the end of August  till the end of September, As I tell everyone they are  the results of Christmas /winter hugs. I  have  had the honour of making some birthday cakes for these events.  I   am a bit of a cheat sometimes and when I do not have sufficient time, or can   t be bothered I use a ready ice. I have a packet of Tesco   s fondant ready ice ready for icing my husband   s cake this weekend. This ready ice is in a now packaged in a green package with a picture of an iced cake on a purple tablecloth.1kg of Ready to Roll will be enough to cover a 10 inch round or a 9 inch square cake with some to spare. I do not keep this icing in a cold place as it   s easier to roll when it is not cold. I then lightly sprinkle some icing sugar on my   surface where I will be rolling the icing. To use this icing first release it from the pack I usually use a pair of scissors. This is a white icing, not sure if they make a coloured one. When opened I then knead the icing for a minute or two, the icing becomes softer, smoother and easier to roll.I then have a ball of icing,  I then roll the icing lifting and turning it to keep it from sticking. If I am being mean and roll it too thin it cracks when I put it on a cake. I think about 1   4 inch is the recommended thickness. Remember to roll out so there is enough icing to drape over the sides. I always place the cake on the icing and cut a wide margin.  . Put the cake on a plate if you want to cover cake with marzipan then brush over lightly with water or if no marzipan and then heat a little apricot or other jam in the microwave and brush it over cake with a pastry brush, this makes icing stick better Now then lift the icing gently and place over the cake. It is better to trim excess rather tan not have enough to cover. I have known the icing split and I have repaired it by brushing with water.  Try to do this quite quickly or the icing will dry out making it difficult. I find this icing easy to use    its soft easy to roll, if the gkids are with me they have some to play with (it usually end up grey) Now the fun part to decorate  there are plenty of decorations available to decorate cakes with , plenty of colours to pain on not sure whether I will  colour  my husband green and put a few flowers on then stick a Barbie bicycle on it  . (He is a mad keen cyclist) Or otherwise I shall make a caterpillar cake out of lots of cup cakes stuck together. (He also loves butterflies and insects). Contains 395 cal per 100g. Be war ned Tesco says cannot guarantee nut free.5oo g of Tesco ready ice will cost    1.37 for 500g and    2.14 for a kgI am always pleased with the results so yes I would recommend this.     ::::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5414290:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6657747:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6845479:4:::6845479:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6785596:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6771611:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6834688:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6805476:5:::6805476:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Cadbury's Celebration Flake Cake::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::18.09.2010::::    I took a Cadbury flake cake into work to celebrate my birthday, it is custom for the birthday person to take cake or goodies to share with other staff.I know this Cadbury celebration flake cake always goes down well as several other people have taken this in to share when it is their birthdays.I usually shop in Tesco where this cake costs    7.00 it also costs    7 in Sainsbury and Ocado. This cake comes in a yellow box with the blue Cadbury swirl on it there is a clear see through window   so you can see the cake. Nutrition info and information telling you there are 12 portions are printed on the box. The cake weighs 855g I can not find out how many calories but since it   s a chocolate cake you can guess there are lotsThe cake is a round one. The cake is covered in chocolate on top of which there are lots of milk, dark and white chocolate shavings. Around the circumference of the cake 12 short pieces of Cadbury flake are positioned. The pieces   are pointing into the cake and do make it easy to cut the cake equally into 12 pieces a piece with a flake piece in for each slice.  A slice is quite a respectable size it   s sufficient. If you wanted to glam the cake up to personalise it add some birthday candles and some cake toppers there are many plastic happy birthdays around When this cake is removed from the box some of the chocolate shavings will most likely have fallen of the cake, never mind just sprinkle them back on. Underneath all that chocolate topping is a chocolate sponge cake.  The cake is layered several times with thin lines of chocolate cream.The cake is moist and scrummy, it   s soft and light. It is quite rich and chocolaty ideal for a chocoholic. Although the chocolate shaving fall of this cake the cake itself is moist not crumbly , mind you I have seen children  make a complete chocolate mess with this cake I may not get a chocolate face after eating but children certainly do. The cake cuts quite well  apart from losing  some flake , flakes it does not fall to pieces.     ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6657747:3:::6785596:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5719918:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5414290:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6800944:4:::6651411:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

The front of the car has a passenger and driver   s seat with a steering wheel so the play Mobil lady will sit in the car and your child can drive this car   and then unload it.

       " '5247778::::Tresemme Mini Paddle Handbag Hair Brush::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::16.09.2010::::    I recently bought a TREsemme Mini Paddle Brush from Boots. This hairbrush cost me    3.99. You get 12 Boots points with this purchase. This brush measures 16cm long and. The handle being 8cm long and 2 and a bit cm wide it is a flat not rounded handle. The handle has a round hole at the end, this might be useful to thread a ribbon through to hang it up somewhere if needed to .The head of the brush is 8cm long too but wider at 5cm s. I think I have just realized why this style of brush is called a paddle, it s because it s flat, and looking at the back of my brush I can see it does resemble a paddle. This is a black plastic brush, the bristles are plastic too. Plastic bristles are maybe less forgiving on the scalp than real bristle or nylon. However I quite like to feel the bristles on my scalp massaging and helping the circulation .The TREsemme logo is on the front of the hairbrush handle telling you TREsemme is used by professionals This brush has a cushioned head. I like cushioned headed hair brushes they are more giving and comfortable than one without cushioning. The bristles are about 11/2 cm long they have a rounded ball end to them. I have long hair half way down my back and it needs a good brush. I do get tangles in my hair so these need sorting out. I grip the TREsemme mini paddle brush in my hand, it is soft and easy it s comfortable to grasp. Now I brush my hair .The length of the bristles is good, goes right through my hair. I can feel the bristles on my scalp. Now for that tangle at the back of my hair. I start near the end of my hair and brush a couple of times , that part tangle free I move up the hair and brush downwards, two or three brushes my hair is tangle free. I now for your benefit brush the rest of my hair. This handbag brush does a good job my hair well brushed and in order am ready to face the world. I am glad I bought this TREsemme paddle hairbrush for my hand bag. I suspect it will last quite a long time , my old handbag hairbrush was one where the it was made in two parts a handle and the brush these were fitted together but somehow they came apart in my bag and I could not fit it together successfully. Yes I really like my new handbag hairbrush. It does fit in my handbag well but I imagine if you had a really dainty one it might not.      ::::6745849:3:::6745849:3:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::3957:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5604945:4:::5604945:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6855417:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6781956:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6771611:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5347743:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6844462:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6292077:4:::6689426:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5719918:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6816341:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6853476:4:::6853476:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tobar Fairy Tale Puppets King::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::15.09.2010::::    This King finger puppet is one I bought for my grandchildren a while ago when I went to thier house recently I noticed it  on the floor  the children had been playing with it .  I bought my puppet at Lloyds chemist but I expect you will be able top buy it at   toy and gift shops. I looked on line and it cost    1.50 now. On line at http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Gift-Shop-Fairytale-Finger-Puppets- you can buy for    1.45 This king is one of the fairy tale finger puppets there are several more characters. This king is about 8cm tall.  .  I can just put this puppet on my fingerits  a tight fit its better for a child   s finger not too loose. The king has a yellow crown on his wooden head, he has some brown hair and his features are   painted on, he looks friendly a big smile and wide eyes. The king wears a royal red top and has arm with little pink hand peeking out he is holding a yellow A sceptre. He had black trousers on his little legs. The red top is where you stick your finger it is a simple finger stall. This puppet is fun for the children play with and is ideal for their puppet shows which I as a doting grandparent have to watch. Yes it   s good for their drama and theatre skills. I have used   Tobar finger puppets at school too they are good for fine motor control encouraging children to move and wriggle and bend their fingers. These are super little puppets at a good price These finger puppets are quite durable  will probably last your childs interest in them and longer. There is a Prince, Princess, Fairy, Witch and Dragon, and  a Scarecrow finger puppet available in the  fairy tale  range of finger puppets from Tobar.     ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6391230:3:::6391230:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5646482:3:::3728:3:::3728:3:::6856248:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::3957:4:::6145850:4:::6844462:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6800944:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6855353:4:::6855353:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6830048:4:::6816341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

She loves the play Mobil bunnies one has a backpack. This set would be suitable for a 4 year old Looking at the playmobil website I do not think thier bunnies  series is made any more. The place I could find this to buy was http://www.amazon.com/Playmobil-4457-Bunny-Backpac k-Chicken/dp/B003HOTE5I for  19.Its amazing how quickly one toy become  quot;not available quot; However when on sale I believe it cost around    12. Playmobil toys are durable They are all made of a washable plastic. If you see it for sale second hand then expect it to be in good order. Included in this set as well as the small bunny there is a piece of green plastic moulded top look like grass. There is a piece of fence a white chicken and 3 eggs , there is a deer too and then there is a stick to help bunny walk the hills and There is a red rucsac with an open top this fits well on bunnies shoulders. The bunny is wearing blue dungarees his legs move together up and down. The eggs can be put in the rucsac for easy carrying My granddaughter plays with this and her farm together.

       " '5247778::::Bird Valley, Agadir::::Travel::::40::::helpful::::13.09.2010::::    The valley of the birds, bird valley is a small bird zoo / park in the centre of Agadir It was very close to the Hotel the Sud Bahai where we stayed this Easter. Unfortunately when we decided to visit a part of it was closed why I am not sure but I am sure it was only it was only a temporary closure.The entry to this bird valley is free, it was when we visited and I have read on the internet that although you used to pay a small entry fee that entry is now free. The park opens in the morning from 9.30 till 12.30 then reopens at 2.30 till 6 pm. Although when we visited there were ribbons across the paths to most of the bird aviaries I could actually see most of them as this park is a narrow strip of land that is small. The birds are kept in large aviaries and from the information I read there are Parrots peacocks, lorikeet, Swans macaws, cranes, ducks, hens and various other birds too. From what I could see the cages looked fine and the birds in good condition. Although we did not see them as part of the park was closed I believe there is a small zoo area with wallabies and llamas This park is not simply just cages of birds but there is also a good water fall feature and a good play park for children. Although we did not have the grandchildren with us I looked at the play equipment and decided it was quite good a fair range of activities, swings slides, climbing apparatus we noticed that the children there were having a good time. I would suggest that this would be a good visit for an hour or two maybe for a family. Or if you are interested in birds just to look and see what is there before going bird watching in the Moroccan countryside.     ::::3957:2:::6477551:2:::6477551:2:::6302297:2:::6302297:2:::5439461:2:::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::6723241:2:::5633146:3:::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6701923:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6496990:3:::6496990:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5604945:3:::5604945:3:::6758966:3:::6758966:3:::6689426:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::5505847:3:::5505847:3:::6462090:3:::6462090:3:::6855417:3:::6017016:3:::6017016:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5414290:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6852948:4:::6852948:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6854616:4:::6850650:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Build-It-Bits n-Bobs-Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::12.09.2010::::    This Construction set from the early learning centre is a good construction toy.  It is like a plastic mechano system fitting together with nuts and bolts.There are several sets of    build it up    either for a simple car this costs    15 from http://www.elc.co.uk  or a build it monster car costing    50. The pieces are   red, green, blue there are black wheels too.This toy is   suitable for a 2 to 6 year old the E.L.C says but I think a  2 year old would not be able to do the nuts and bolts unaided so more suitable for  over 3 year olds. Do watch the bolts with children who still mouth everything as they are small enough to swallow. There are 40 pieces in this set, lots of nuts and bolts  and other pieces to build a car , a robot and many other things This set is treally an add on set to complement the other build it up  sets. I have played with various pieces of these kits at work and once your child has some fine motor skills they are good. Your child can be creative making vehicles and animals and other unidentifiable object from these   learning how to screw and fit the pieces together. There are instructions included to follow to make a model. These are a good large size for a child to hold and fit. The spanner and screwdriver are useful tools. This toy will help with eye hand coordination and construction skills let your child use their imagination to make models. Good for problem solving too, working out how to attach and make an object. Have fun playing with your childrens toys these early days pass so quickly.     ::::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6831875:3:::6831875:3:::6701923:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::6657747:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6844462:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6854841:4:::6850640:4:::6850640:4:::6845486:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6693128:4:::6816341:4:::6152423:4:::6781956:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::6800944:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6757811:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6855417:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6854616:4:::6840580:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Heinz Spaghetti Hoops in Tomato Sauce::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.09.2010::::    Heinz started by making horseradish sauce 140 years ago, they progressed   into canning and baked beans became popular they then canned spaghetti in tomato sauce. In 1965 they produce canned spaghetti hoops. I had a tin of Heinz spaghetti hoops with the grandchildren the other day.  I often buy shops own brands but I know these Heinz ones are always a reliable good flavourHeinz spaghetti hoops come in tins, a small size containing 205 g also the larger one of 400g. Just recently a new snap pot size has become available containing 190g these usually comer in a 4 pack.There are 61 calories in 100g   when I serve these a 400g tin will serve 3 adults.  Spaghetti hoops taste the same as the Heinz spaghetti in tomato sauce the difference being that the spaghetti is made into small hoops. The spaghetti is quite soft and there is a good quantity of red tomato sauce to cover the hoops, the hoops do not really have much flavour it is the tomato sauce which has that tomato flavour it   s quite a sweet flavoured tomato sauce. The flavour is tomato but that does not mean to say that the child that likes Heinz spaghetti hoops in tomato sauce will like tomatoes.Spaghetti hoops can be served on a slice of toast or with a fried/poached egg or a sausage. You could pile them on a baked potato; there are many ways to serve a portion of Heinz spaghetti hoops. In fact you can buy tins of Heinz spaghetti hoops with sausages. Children enjoy eating hoops and getting hoops hoped on their forks.To cook/heat spaghetti hoops I usually use the microwave I put them in a covered bowl to save splattering all over the inside of my microwave and heat for a few minutes, instructions are on the can. They can of course be heated on the hob. Heinz spaghetti hoops are 54p for a 400g can at Tesco and the other leading supermarkets, 40p for the 205g tin Tesco   s own brand spaghetti rings cost for 2190g and 28p for 215g.

       " '5247778::::Mothercare Wooden Shape Sorter::::Family::::40::::helpful::::10.09.2010::::    This wooden shape sorter from mothercare costs    10 at the moment it was    12. This shape sorter is suitable for children aged over 12 months old. I have played with it alongside older special needs children.This shape sorter is a wooden cubed cage with 4 shapes cut out of each flat end piece.  This is not a very big sorter it measures 15x15 x 13cm.The shape sorter is a natural colour and the eight shapes to post through the holes are coloured wood. Each shape is 3 dimensional.Around each shaped hole is a coloured outline this matches the colour of the correct shape. For example the red semi circle shape fits through the hole with a red outline. The coloured outline gives the child an extra clue as to where the shape fits. This shape sorter helps develop your child   s hand eye control and their motor control. It also gives practice at matching both shape and colour. Your part with this toy is to talk to your child tell them the shape and colour and soon they will be able to name them correctly. This is a very durable toy and after your child has finished with it should still be in fit condition to pass on.     ::::6302297:2:::6302297:2:::6750576:2:::5439461:2:::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6576767:3:::6576767:3:::6800944:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5719918:3:::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6292077:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6832611:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5646482:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5953084:3:::5953084:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6462090:3:::6462090:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6855417:4:::6844462:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6378505:4:::6855394:4:::6855394:4:::6840580:4:::6239059:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Lemon Bath Soap::::Beauty::::40::::helpful::::09.09.2010::::    Tesco Lemon Bath Soap (4x125g) I have a bar of this lemon soap on a soap dish in my bathroom. I usually use shower gel in the shower and hand wash in the downstairs cloakroom I have hand wash by the bathroom sink too.I find handwash in a bottle much cleaner/neater particularly after the grandchildren have used it I bought this soap originally because I thought it must work out cheaper to use rather than   liquid soaps and washes.  This soap costs 99p for 4 x 125g bars. These 4 bars of soap come packaged together in a clear plastic.  Now they are a lovely fresh lemon yellow colour. They do smell lightly of lemon.  This is a good scent suitable for males and females.I often wash my hands upstairs using this bar of soap. It gives a reasonable lather. This is not a luxury soap so does not feel ever so creamy.  But I quite like this soap it cleans my hands well enough it   s good for the grandchildren   s hands too,When I have run out of shower gel or hand wash I have used this instead and it does a good job, some people might find it dries their skin out   if they use it lot soaps generally do.

       " '5247778::::Peppa Pig Sticker & Activity Collection: 8 Books - Ladybird::::Books::::40::::very helpful::::07.09.2010::::    My granddaughter aged 4 loves Peppa pig, so when I noticed that the book people had a selection of 8 Peppa Pig Activity books on sale in the staff room I bought a pack for her.   One of the books included in this set was the Colour and draw book. The complete set cost me    7.99, I noticed on the back of the book it says    3.99 and looking on line I notice http://www.petitesouris.co.uk is selling this single book for that price. This book and the others from this selection are suitable for a 3-5 year old. I have kept this book at my house so it is ready for my granddaughter to colour and draw when she visits.  This book has a blue cover with a picture of Peppa Pig smiling on it. There are 16 pages to this book the first page a title page then 15 activity pages 15 of them. There are a couple of double page activities but most are single page activities. . At the top of each page there are written instructions like,    Silly daddy pig is in the pond with the ducks use your brightest pencils to colour in this picture    The words are clearly printed in black. A child who is beginning to read may be able to read some of these words.  Some of the pages have simple colouring in pictures, others have activities like dot to dots these have no numbers. The picture and the positioning of the dots makes it obvious where to join. I notice my granddaughter has done all those dot to dot pages first, all on her own too. Then there are pages where your child has to draw their own picture. for example one page   you have to draw what you think is in Georges birthday present. The surrounds and pictures in this book are good bright colours simple pictures; the paper is good quality too, not like some cheap colouring in books. My granddaughter has had fun doing this book. I think it is a good idea to get a character activity book like this to encourage childrens pencil skills. I thinks this book would be an ideal   book to take on holiday or a visit to relatives to provide something to keep your child amused. I think as past of the 8 books for    7.99 I got from the book people this was a fair price. However I do not think I would pay    3.99 for this activity book on its own. I discover that you can download and print Peppa pig pictures for colouring and dot to dots at http://www.coloring.ws or athttp://www.coloring-book , I suspect there are other sites doing this too.     ::::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::3957:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6844671:4:::6844671:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6378505:4:::6834688:4:::6785596:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6850650:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6701923:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6844462:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6840580:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lotus Tissues with Olbas Oil::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::06.09.2010::::    Have you got a stuffy nose, painful sinus   s nose congestion? I get this several times a year. I suffer with hay fever and I get stuffed up nose I sometimer get really painful sinus   s, If I have a heavy cold I sometimes get a bunged up nose too. The usual thing for me to do is to reach for Olbas oil I usually us the liquid in a bottle, sometimes I dab a drop or two of this onto a hanky to sniff.I have sometimes bought some tissues already treated with Olbas oil. These come in a packet containing 6 packs of tissues. There are 9 tissues in each of these packs. In the packet of tissues are 6 tissues, each tissue measuring about 20x20cm. These tissues are infused with Olbas oil. Olbas oil is made of Dementholised Mint Oil     Eucalyptus Oil     Cajuput Oil     Menthol     Juniperberry Oil When opening the packet you get a light whiff of Olbas oil. When I use one of these white tissues I taker it from the packet and crush it this helps release the   oils I sniff the tissue and   feel the oils easing my congestion. I inhale the scent and it does ease my congested nose, I can almost feel my nose dripping. I do take a non Olbas oil tissue and blow my nose it seems a shame to spoil the Olbas soaked tissue as they work out expensive if I use then throw away instantly.  The vapour on the tissue lasts a little while enabling me to clear my nose several times before disposing of the tissue. Sometimes they maker my eyes run too. I really would recommend these tissues they do help ease pain and stuffed up nose, trouble is Olbas oil really stinksThis is a convenient way to help clear my nose at work or when I am out.  These tissues are available for    1.49 from Lloyds pharmacy we have on in the high street I also notice after doing an on line search that you can buy then from pound land for    1 at Tesco they are     1.53.  I really would recommend these tissues they do help ease pain and stuffed up nose, trouble is Olbas oil really stinks. Oh and they are not recommended to babies under 3 months old. Be careful not to  get the tissue really near/on your eye do not rub your eye with hands after using  one of these tissues as I know  undiluted Olbas oil will sting the eye and make them water so these might have a similar effect.      ::::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6800944:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6145850:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6191281:4:::6191281:4:::6723241:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6852948:4:::6852948:4:::3957:4:::6378505:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6844462:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6816341:4:::6850650:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6840580:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 3354 Thomas & Friends Gordon::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::05.09.2010::::    Do your children love Thomas the tank Engine? Duplo has been making the trains from this series for many years now. Gordon is the Blue train with a smile.This train is suitable for a 2 year old up to about 5 or 6 years. At work we have a Duplo train set Gordon   s Express 3354. This set contains 13 bricks and will run on Duplo Tracks which you have to buy separately. This set includes Gordon s engine, a coal truck and a carriage. The pieces all fit together with those knobbly bits like other Lego/Duplo bricks Gordon himself has 4 pieces to fit together these are the wheel base, two bricks for the cab and one piece with the Gordon face on it. Gordon as all Thomas train fans will know is Blue. Gordon has an attachment point behind him to attach the coal truck This truck is made of 4 pieces , the wheel base,  two bricks which when put together have a number 4 on them in yellow then a flat black coal brick tops this truck . The coal truck has an attachment point both back and front so it can be attached to the train and to the carriage. The carriage is made up of the rest of the bricks and can be attached behind the coal truck. The wheels of this train turn easily when pushed, you do not need a track but   a track gives more play opportunities. . This Gordon train is good for your child   s motor skills, their hand eye coordination and their imaginary play. If playing in a group with these trains it is also good for social skills learning to share, taking turns. This truck is quite popular amongst the children and gets played with, with the other Duplo trains that we have. This as with all Lego Duplo bricks is very durable and will last for years and years. At home I have Duplo over 30 years old my daughters which I saved for the grandkids. The colours do not fade much.Gordon is easy to wash in hot soapy water if he gets dirty ours does as it often gets played with soil and gets sucked and dribbled on. I looked on line and Gordon does not seem to be easily available most  places say its unavailable .however, at http://www.scottstoybox.co.uk its    27  and I expect you would be able to buy it in good nic second hand     ::::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5646482:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6145850:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6844462:4:::6816341:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6378505:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6422123:4:::6422123:4:::6161720:4:::6161720:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6847751:4:::6847751:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6840580:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6854616:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tobar French Knitting Doll::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::05.09.2010::::    I have experienced several French knitting dolls in my life time; this one from Tobar is one of them.http://www.amazon.co.uk is selling this knitting doll for    2.99 upwards; I anticipate that you would buy one in a craft shop or craft department of a big shop like J Lewis for under a fiver.Now my first knitting Nancy as we used to call them was an empty wooden cotton reel with 4 nails that my dad hammered in for me. Wooden cotton reels have now been replaced by plastic ones  This French knitting doll from Tobar is made of wood.  This doll is 9 cm tall which is a good size for both an adult and a child   s hand.   Nancy is curvy and shaped a curve for her feet a curve for her legs and a curve for her body then her head is curved too on the top there is a small curve which looks like a hat. On the top of Nancy   s head 4 looped pins have been nailed in.This French knitting doll is a golden wooden brown , features have been printed onto her face a smiling mouth with cheek lines m a round nose and some eyes , that   s not all this knitting Nancy has glasses on , she looks more like a grandma  than a young girl.. With this doll from Tobar comes a short wooden needle (without eye). I used to use one of mums knitting needles. A crochet hook is also a good tool instead of the needle. Also some wool comes with this doll so you can get started straight away. The curved shaping of this French knitting doll makes it easy to hold and grip. To start thread some wool; down the centre of the Dolly so some wool hangs out of the bottom.Then wind the wool loosely around one of the pins twice. Now with the needle or a crochet hook, hook the bottom loop of wool and take it over the top one into the centre of the dolly. Turn the dolly round anti clockwise so that the next pin is facing you wind the  wool around  in an anti clockwise direction twice  and again  hook the bottom loop over the top one. Continue till you have wound wool round all the pins.  Pull the wool at the bottom a little to tighten. Now wind the wool once round the   next pin where you made your first stitch then begin the circuit of winding wool round the pins and lifting the bottom loop over the top one.  Continue until you have a long thin coil of knitting come out of the end. You can make this as long as you like.  To cast of cut the wool leaving about a 10 cm end thread this wool through the loops and pull to tighten and fasten of.An instruction leaflet comes with this French knitting doll otherwise look at http://www.how-to-knit-guide.com/french-knitting.html  very clear instructions with illustrations here. Now what do you do with this long coil of knitting?  Well you could make a bracelet of a necklace for dolly from short ones. You could wind it all round sewing together to make a round table mat, you could use the braid to sew onto the edges of a cushion to trim it, and ummm I am running out of ideas. Any other ideas please paste in my comments box     ::::6701923:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6145850:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6378505:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::6844462:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6840580:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6785596:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6800944:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6834688:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bosch BSGL4000::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::04.09.2010::::    I have a sad tale to tell you but it has a happy ending. 2 weeks  ago my Morphy Richards vacuum cleaner died, it coughed splutters and sucked no more dirt.  Oh no my husband said more expense  We searched the internet for advice, guidance for information and reviews which vacuum cleaner would suit our needs best. Finally we decided it had to be a Bosch BSGL4000GB 2000 w. This is a cylinder vacuum cleaner. Now where shall we buy it from we asked each other we found it on line at different retailers priced from    89       160. We looked at http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk I did not want to wait for delivery I wanted a vacuum cleaner and I wanted it now. We looked at the comet website and noticed that if  you ordered the vacuum cleaner on line  with a discount code available till tomorrow  bank holiday Monday and collected it in store it was    104 .99 . The price if we went into the store without pre-ordering on line would be    139.99. So not being silly we ordered ours. It comes with a 2 year Manufacturer Warranty. So we went to our local Comet 8 miles away and got ours. The vacuum cleaner came in a card box not too big to put in the back of the car. The dimensions are Height=25.5 cm Depth=40.0 cm Width=28.7 cm. This vacuum cleaner is a compact one it   s light too 4.8 kg.Although I personally do not need it this vacuum  has HEPA filtration     this is good for those with asthma  and allergy sufferers This vacuum looks smart it is black and silver. The hose is 1.6 metres stretched. The electrical cord is 8 metres so this will reach 10 metres  to clean without needing to  unplug and change position. There is a push button cord rewind feature.   The suction tube is telescopic so I can adjust it to any height As well as the standard fitting for carpets there is an Upholstery tool and a crevice tool. at the back of the vacuum there is in theory a place to store these but hubby tried  unsuccessfully, I did not have better success , oh well they can be stored in a kitchen draw. The brushes  floor tool can be height adjusted for use on different sorts of flooring. The noise it makes is about avarage for a cleaner not super quiet or horrendously noisy.   This cleaner is a bagged one it comes with 2 bags these have a dust capacity of 4 litres. I did buy some replacement bags while I was in comet 4 dust bags + 1 micro hygiene filter.  Cost    9.49 now that   s a lot of money. I shall search the internet for a cheaper bag that fits also I will search to see if there are reusable bags to fit the Bosch BSGL4000GB.If you have knowledge of them then please let me know   When I first switched it on I immediately was delighted with the suction it   s very strong it   s a 2000 w engine really powerful. There is a switch to twist to vary the power this means that I can adjust it to the surface that I am cleaning. I admit I have not used this many times yet to clean my carpets. I am very happy with the ease of use and how strong the suction was.  So far so good I am happy with my purchase.  Cleans well is light, I store mine in an under stairs cupboard, it does not take up too much room.     ::::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6785596:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6378505:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6757811:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6701923:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6844462:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6834688:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6838950:4:::6838950:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6844671:4:::6844671:4:::6840580:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Melissa&Doug Deluxe Fish Bowl Jumbo Knob Puzzle::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.09.2010::::    This fishbowl wooden puzzle is another fantastic puzzle from Melissa and Doug. This puzzle is a really thick piece of wood shaped like a fish bowl. It is 1.7 quot; x 12 quot; x 12.5 quot;/4.1 x 29.2 x 30.5 cm.In this wooden fish bowl puzzle three fish shaped pieces are cut out ,a fish a turtle and a crab. These pieces have huge jumbo knobs on them. These knobs are easy to grasp so the shapes can be removed and replaced in their places. Each of the jigsaw pieces are brightly painted.The fish a yellow gold the crab red the turtle a black shell with green head legs and tail. Each has large eyes and a smiling mouth. When removed from their places on the puzzle there is a matching picture underneath.The fish bowl shaped base has a natural wood outline with crafter by hand and Melissa and Doug written on it the interior of the bowl shape is painted blue this has a few lighter wavy blue lines painted across it and there are a few white circles representing bubbles. This is an attractive puzzle and a good one for children over the age of 1 year old. It is easy to manipulate and position the pieces.I have used this puzzle with special needs children and although suitable for a normal 1 year old -2.1/2 year old it really is ideal for older children with poor manipulative, hand control. This puzzle is excellent for practicing eye hand coordination. This puzzle would be good for home use or in the early year   s department. You could link this puzzle to a topic about fish or animals have links with the EYFS/early year   s foundation stage, the world about us. You could use this puzzle to aid language development talk about the fish, to count them.I must admit I found it difficult to find on sale on a UK website but discovered you can buy this puzzle from http://dolltv.com  for    6.18 the list price is    10.77. I would think it possible to purchase through educational supplier in the UK. Would I recommend?

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Island Adventure Water Table::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::02.09.2010::::    I came across this little tykes Island Adventure Water the other day about the only day it was sunny /warm enough for water play outside in the garden this summer holiday. This water tray is a blue circular one it stands on orange legs to a height of 70cm. The width of this tray is 28.5 cm. When you buy it the legs come separately packed and you fit then in yourself remove the legs for storing when you are not using it for a while. This water tray is made from polyethylene plastic. The height is fine for a 3 or 3 year old to stand at but an older child will have to kneel or sit down beside it. Little tykes suggest this is suitable for 2 -6 year olds; I would hesitate to buy it for a 4+, 5 or 6 year old .In the centre of this water tray there is an island with a circular hole in which to position the water wheel that comes with it. The island also has a road moulded into the plastic. There is a water feature of a fountain on the island too to get the water to squirt up the fountain your child needs to suppress the coloured bellow knobs at each leg point when pressed water will squirt out of the fountain. The coloured bellow knobs are attached to the fountain with plastic tubing Around the island is a moat which gets filled with water there is a little yellow bridge to fit across the moat. around the outside of the water tray is a flat area the width of a corgi gar this is handy to rest toys on or run a vehicle around before it crosses the moat to the island . The RRP of this toy is    39.99 which is what I think a lot to pay for this toy you can get it in the sale for cheaper at http://www.kidskitchens.com for    29.59 Argos had it for sale earlier for    14.99 but at that price it s understandable that they are sold out. To be honest I do not think this is a really good water tray, ok it has the added attraction of the fountain, and its small will not get in the way. It is in my opinion a bit small the height means that an older child will need to sit or kneel, I do not think it will keep an older child absorbed for long the actual quantity of water it holds is not great. Water play is one of the basics for a child they learn so much, floating, sinking filling, learning the qualities of water pouring, measuring. Filling containers with water helps eye and hand coordination, and motor skills. I think any water container from a washing up bowl or the old baby bath to the purpose build water trays are ideal as for toys anything goes old yogurt pots, washing up liquid containers. In the summer sun and rain permitting your child can be entertained for hours playing with  water in the garden.      ::::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6844462:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771611:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6842412:4:::6378505:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6834688:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5604945:4:::5604945:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6854011:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Kings Seeds Lettuce Salad Bowl::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::16.07.2010::::    Update ,  After I noticed that a lot of the plants from my last sowing of lettuce was going to seed I sowd some more on the 16th August I shall plant some of the seedilings,  which are nearly big enogh now  into the garden and I expect these will be providing me with fresh leaves for a couple of months. I bought a packet of these Kings green Salad Bowl Seeds in April at the same time as a packet of the red ones. I bought mine at a local hardware shop. for    1.I have noticed these seeds at garden centres too These seeds come in a white paper packet with pictures of the green lettuce on and information about sowing. The packet easy to open I tore mine open but you may prefer to use scissors or knife. I sowed some of these seeds in April. There are lots of seeds in the packet, I looked on the Kings website and it says 850, I did not count but quite believe it. The germination rate of these seeds is good. I folded the top over and paper clipped it then yesterday I sowed some more hoping to have a continuous lettuce summer. I always start my lettuce seeds of in a seed tray in the green house to give them a good start. Sow the seeds about 2cm deep with 30cm between rows. These seeds can be sown from March to July so I shall sow a few more at the end of July. The seeds took just over a week to appear as tiny green seedlings then when they were big enough at about 3 weeks old I planted them in a row some alternating between the red ones. Since mid to the end of May I have been taking a few leaves from each lettuce plant for my salads. These lettuces are a good tasting crisp leaf. These lettuce look pretty the outside leaf frilly serrated. I like the way they look in the garden with the red ones. These lettuces are ones which grow new leaves continuously. They will go to seed and taste a little sour after a while that s why I sow more seeds later. Kings are a reputable supplier of seeds from Essex they have been active since 1888. Kings seeds sell many other varieties of seeds and plants as well as other items for your garden. Their address.

       " '5247778::::Matchbox K-19 Scammell Contractor Tipper Truck::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::31.08.2010::::    Many of you particularly the boys will remember Matchbox vehicles from their childhood. Matchbox cars were first produced in 1953 (the year before I was born) by Lesney products this was an industrial die casting company. In 1982 Lesney became bankrupt and after a couple of changes of ownership Matchbox is now owned by Mattel still using the Matchbox name. Matchbox refers to the fact that the original cars were produced to fit in boxes the same size as a matchbox. Now onto the Lesney Matchbox King-Size K-19 Scammell Contractor Tipper Truck. This toy is one my grandchildren play with at my house.  I  am not sure where I got it from possibly bought it at the local charity shop or it might be one of a box  of cars dad kept at his house for mine and my sisters children and  kept for the great grandchildren . This truck was made from 1967 until 1979. This truck is not for sale new, however I note after a search on the internet that there are several on sale at auctions A nearly mint condition one might fetch    30. The one I have which is now by my side at the computer as I write this is not in mint condition some of its tyres are missing it is scratched and worn through many, many years of play.This truck is as metal dye cast toy it originally comes in a window box with an inner picture card tray.This truck measures 11 cm from bumper to tail is 4 cm broad the height is also 4 cm. This truck has a red body and chassis. The base plate is silver and this part also includes the bumper and lights.  On the base plate there is the information    made in England by Lesney Matchbox king size Scammel construction. There is also a step below the doors of the cab included in this silver base plate casting. There are some silver coloured air horns on the cab roof. The radiator grill at the front is black I believe this model is also available with a red grill plate.  The cab is red and detailed from the mouldings. I discover that the doors had a label displaying a white triangle in a white circle however my model does not have this for some reason. The windows on mine are translucent and I can see no steering wheel or other things inside the cab. The tipper chassis is red moulded as part of the cab moulding. There are 10 wheels the hubs red plastic the tyres black. The front has 1 axel with   2 single wheels  the  wheels on the 2  back  axils are double my specimen has lost 3 of its tyres but still keeps rolling along . Before 71 this model did not have super fast wheels mine has so it must be post 1971. The tipper body is yellow my body has a lot of the paintwork scratched off. The tipper body rises easily it is fitted by a metal rod at the back. The back of the tipper body is open so the contents which your child may put in the tipper easily slide out.  My tipper body will not stay in a raised position on its own. Reading info about this toy I read that it was fitted with a  Hydro sleeve    this would have kept the tipper body in a raised position however my truck no longer has a hydro sleeve. My Lesney Matchbox King-Size K-19 Scammell Contractor Tipper Truck although not in a pristine condition is       well loved    played with 100000000000000000000000   s of times by my grandchildren and the generation before him. I would think this truck suitable for a child aged 3+. This truck is great for imaginary play. We a  and  ours often gets filled up with sand  and gets tipped at the     new build    I listen to m y grandchildren as they make appropriate brrmmming and chugging noises as they drive this truck. I watch as their    driving and manoeuvring    skills improve parking has become easier backing up and putting in the correct position. So this toy is great for practicing those motor skills.   I have some gravel in one of my plant pots and the children love to fill the tipper up with this it about. .  I expect this toy will last for a few more years getting played with in the sand pit, it will gain a few more scratches maybe lose another tyre before retiring  to toy heaven. Matchbox toys are great they look like the real thing. They are fantastic to play with will last many years. Not only are they Childs plaything but some older    boys collect them reliving their childhood I guess. If you make model scenes for a hornby train set these would not look out of place. Dye cast trucks like this only cost a few pounds new probable this one cost less than a pound when it was bought many years ago. If it had been in pristine condition I could have sold it for about    20-   30 but the play value my grand kids and the generation before have had from it is certainly worth more than that      ::::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5347743:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::3957:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6800944:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::6145850:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6840580:4:::6834688:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Full Fat Soft & Creamy Cheese::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::29.08.2010::::     It will soon be time to go back to school and the chore of making my sandwiches. I sometimes use the Tesco soft cheeses. These 200g pots of soft cheeses   come in several different varieties I think I have sampled them all. The Tesco soft cheeses come in small white rectangular   pots a couple of cm deep. They all have a blue and white foil top under a clear plastic lid the lids of the cheeses are slightly different colours and have a picture of a biscuit topped with the cheese. The soft and creamy cheese I am describing today is the full fat one it has a dark blue   foil lid. .I usually buy the lower fat version this full fat one contains 80 cal per 30g serving the extra light variety contains only 38cal per 30g serving.Philadelphia soft cream cheese has 75cal per 30g serving  I sometimes put this cheese in a sandwich and sometimes on a cracker. Remove the plastic lid and peel back the foil. When open the cheese is slightly watery on the top, I expect it   s where the cheese solids have settled and separated. The cheese is a white colour. The cheese is a fairly thick creamy consistency it spreads well on crackers or bread. The taste is mild and pleasant I will sometimes add chopped chives or other herbs to this cheese maybe add a tomato too. This cheese is also good for other recipes, sometimes I make a cheesy pasta sauce with it. There are lots of recipes at http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blcreamcheese.htm or go to http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?PagecRef=1I like this cheese and the price is 92 p Tesco is charging    1.19 for the Philadelphia equivalent      ::::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6462090:4:::6462090:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6657747:4:::6846862:4:::6846862:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6145850:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::3957:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6757811:4:::6378505:4:::5696535:4:::5696535:4:::6800944:4:::5414290:4:::6775406:4:::6775406:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hotel Sud Bahia, Agadir::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::29.08.2010::::    We escaped to Morocco this Easter and stayed at the hotel Sud Bahia in Agadir. We booked the hotel and flight independently worked out a little cheaper not much. When we arrived in Agadir airport at about 6 o   clock pm we got a taxi to the hotel. This was sensible as we had thought of hiring a car from airport but it would have been difficult to find the hotel as it was getting dusk and in a large sprawling seaside resort.  . The airport of Agadir is in fact quite a distance from Agadir itself about 30- 40 minutes away. The Sud Bahai is in the centre of Agadir about 500 metres from the beach 10-20 minutes walk. We parked just outside the hotel for fee, never had any problems parking here, but there is a secure parking next to the hotel you pay a surcharge for this.. We were slightly anxious about what to expect at the hotel as it was a last minute booking  and some of the reviews we had read were a little unflattering . However we are not the kind of people who spend a lot of time at our holiday accommodation as we like to explore the environs.This hotel is classed as 3 stars it is a budget hotel. There are 245 room in this hotel we had a double room that had a small balcony overlooking a small courtyard. The Sud Bahai is a Hotel that was built in the 1960   s after an earthquake that flattened a lot of this coastal area. So if you want an older more traditional hotel this is not for you.  Enter into the hotel and there is a fairly large lobby with a greetings /booking desk which was usually manned by at least 2 people.  This front desk is open 24 hours.   There is a concierge service on hand to offer sightseeing assistance. There is also a laundry service available. We   booked in no problems as a little was English was spoken and French,  I have school girl French and did understand some of it . We were shown our room. Entering our room on the left was the entrance to the bathroom opposite this was a fitted wardrobe and drawers. Then into the bedroom.  Our room had twin beds a bedside cabinet with two bedside lamps on it and a telephone.There was one chair in the room, shame there were not two as there would just have been room for two chairs.   At the foot of the bed here were some drawers under a long unit on which a television sat. The beds we found comfortable not soft   but not so hard you felt like you were sleeping on a plank of wood. This was not a large room but very adequate, very much like other hotel rooms that I have been in. The room was a pretty basic standard, clean, utilitarian. But hey we were here to enjoy Morocco not our hotel room. The colour scheme was orange fabric light coloured walls and wooden furniture. The bathroom had a toilet a bidet a washbasin, the tap dripped a bit possible with a lot of forcing to stop but irritating. There was a bath which had a shower attachment.  The bathroom was only just alright not luxurious. I think it would be good if they updated it soon.   White towels were provided, these were clean but although not terrible they were obviously quite old. We were left some individual small soap in the bathroom. But no shampoo and shower gels, no toothpastes. So basically the rooms were fine for us as we were not aiming to spend our days there.  Will need some updating soon I think. We arrived in the evening and after depositing out luggage in our room we went downstairs. We discovered there was an ATM next to the reception desk and this is where we used our credit cards to get cash.  When we had a bit of a nosey round the corridor along our floor we noticed a conference suite set out with tables and chairs for a meeting. There is public internet service available.    Wander past the reception to the restaurant.  We had booked half board so had our breakfasts and evening meals here    The restaurant had tables set out for 4 an people wee never had any trouble finding table in a position that suited us. Staffs were there to greet and seat you if you required but we always preferred to find our own table. Some of the staff spoke English and all were pleasant. The restaurant had windows all along one side this looked out over the pool area.  There were not many waiting staff but this was Easter and hotel not full, however there was enough staff to for the needs of all the customers.  We arrived at the hotel early evening meals were served 7pm till 9 pm We sat down at our table in the evening and were shown the menu this was in English and French I think there were menus in other language for visitors from other countries. Each night there were 2 choices of starter   s main meals and desert, maybe in the height of season there might be more but I do not know about this. Saying there were only 2 choices there was always something that we liked. Starters would be a choice of soup or something like melon, salad or meats. We usually had the soup it was usually ok sometimes well, sometimes a bit watery. A couple of slices of bread were served in a bread basket on the table. The main would always a choice of fish with rice/ vegetables/ salads, one night there was a cous cous dish.  The alternates would be chicken or beef, all the dished were fairly European I Thought we might have some more traditional Moroccan fare. Desserts. As often when we go abroad desserts are a bit disappointing there were cr   me caramels yoghurts    cakes and always fruit. We usually choose fruit.    Having said that, we were not dissatisfied with our meals they were well cooked and servings fairly good. The staff were friendly we were often served by the Maitre D he was very nice recognised us after a couple of occasions.  Fresh free water was always available to drink at the table, although there was a bar in the hotel no wine list in the restaurant. Breakfasts were served in the restaurant from 7 am till 10am we were usually up by 8 -8.30. Although staff were around at breakfast the breakfast food was displayed on a servery where you helped your selves. Some of the choices for breakfasts were fair, breads, croissants, tostadas, jams and marmalades, eggs sometimes boiled sometimes scrambled, cold meats, salads. Cups of tea were served at the table.  There was fresh orange juice available but this had to be paid for. Again Breakfasts were fine good to set us up for the day. Full board is also available and lunch served in the restaurant.  Although we did not need this there was a snack bar next to the pool selling drinks and light refreshments, I noticed some people eating pizzas there. There is a small bar area where were bought some beer one night and listened to the entertainment. The hotel had a guy who played a keyboard most evenings. The night we went in there was a display of some local traditional dancing. This was ok for a light entertainment.  I think that there is also a disco available on summer nights although we were not aware of this. There is a pool onsite this is situated just outside the restaurant at Easter. We noticed a couple of hardy souls swimming every morning. We were not around the hotel in the day time so did not notice its use between about 9am and 6 pm. In the info it says thier pool is heated. The pool was kept clean when we ate breakfasts the staff were going round the pool and netting out leaves and debris that had fallen in. I noted there was also a lady cleaning the tiled walkway around the pool every morning too. A well as the swimming pool there was a splash pool for children. Overall my opinion of this hotel was that it was fine.  Maybe not the most glamorous but a good, clean hotel. The situation was ok, not far from sea or town.  The price for a week, 7 days in early June for bed and breakfast is    64. Per person for bed breakfast evening meal its    96.50p per person. We paid less than this in April. These prices do not include air fare of course. Would I be prepared to go to this hotel again?  Yes I would be happy to stay here if in the area     ::::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6757811:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6378505:4:::5261772:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6292077:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6800944:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6785596:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6853014:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5414290:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

These orange lemon slices are one of the products which now have The Dr Oetker logo on the label which pictures orange and lemon slices on an iced desert. Orange and lemon slices like this have been around for donkey s years. They are small semi circular jelly slices orange or lemon coloured. They taste lightly of the orange or lemon flavour. These slices are not uniform in colour the outer rim of the jelly fruit slice is slightly darker than the rest to represent the rind of the fruit. These slices are good for decorating cakes or sweet deserts. .If I am icing and decorating a lemon or orange cake I will use these. These would be good for children to use to decorate an iced cake or ice a plain biscuit and decorate with them. They make a good substitute for a cherry as a mouth on a gingerbread man, also would make good ears. These Dr Oetker jelly lemon and orange slices will cost you 69p in Tesco , I expect you can buy them in most other supermarkets .

This sticker pad is A4 sized and has 15 pages of brightly coloured scenes to decorate with the stickers. The scenes include a beach scene and woodland scene.  There are 16 stickers these are stuck on a yellow sheet they include stickers of Peppa pig and her chums in different costumes and positions. . You   peel off the sticker and position it on the scene. These stickers are the reusable sort so they can be removed and stuck elsewhere. Cassie has removed the stickers and made new scenes several times.She has also embellished the pages with her own drawing with crayons and felt tip. It is possible to stick the stickers back onto the yellow sheet. These pages can be removed from the pad and positioned on your child   s wall. I think this sticker pad worth the    2.50, not sure about    3.50 though.

Conserve is just another name for jam, usually means not made with preservatives, conserve sounds posher than jam doesn   t it.Once upon a time a long time ago two young weary English hitchhikers were stopped at a shop to buy provisions they were tempted by the French Jams.  One jar an apricot one in an attractive shaped jar with a red and white chequered screw top lid stood out. Hubby (yes we were on honeymoon early 70   s) being an apricot lover choose this.When we were young this jam was not available in British shops but now it is available in many supermarkets.I bought some of this jam the other day it costs 1.99 at Tesco on offer 2 for    3.20. I think that when I have bough in France that the prices have been a little cheaper.This is an expensive jam Duerr s Apricot Preserve not only does it contain less than a lot of other jam jars 370g compared to 454g it tends to be more expensive. Duerrs apricot preserve 454g costs    159 at Tesco   s Hartley   s best  apricot 340g costs    1 .35   This Bonne Maman Apricot conserve comes in an attractive jar with a red and white gingham lid gives it a country look. The jar contains 370g.This conserve contains no preservatives so once open keep it in the fridge.  Bonne Maman uses 50g of fruit per 100g of jam I remember  my mum using  half fruit half sugar when she made jams   citric acid is also in this jam , mum used lemon juice helps it set she said.  This jam is delicious comparable to my mothers home made jams. Lots of large pieces of fruit, it   s a thick jam not runny quite sweet, but not over sweet. It really dopes have that home made taste. This jam is delicious straight on bread I remember two young people sat on the banks of the river Dordogne open jar of jam. They tore of pieces of French bread from the French stick bread they had bought and dipped it into the jam jar fishing out jam with pieces of apricot. . I still like to buy a French stick and eat it with Bonne Maman jam. It is delicious really tastes of apricots. I also like to eat this conserve on croissants, if I am making jam tarts I use it too it is an ideal jam to use whenever I need jam in cooking . This apricot conserve is good at breakfast or tea time, in fact any time of the day. Oh well time to leave that young couple on the banks of the Dordogne eating French bread and Bonne Maman  apricot conserve , time now for this grandma to  make breakfasts for her guests  yes croissants and Bonne Maman apricot conserve is on the menu .     ::::6853090:3:::6609678:4:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5971856:4:::5971856:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5414290:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6378505:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6845486:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6474927:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6834688:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Fuzzy felt Pets::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::27.08.2010::::    Fuzzy-Felt was officially launched on August 30th 1950,  . With the creation of many more toys since then I do not think it is as popular now as it was in the 60   s 70   s. In fact I do not think the felt pieces as good quality /thickness as they were in earlier years. However think that they are still a good creative art toy for children over 3 years old, I think it would hold interest for children up to 5 or 6 years old there are many different sets of fuzzy felt   featuring shapes covering many different topics. You can buy sets with different felt board sizes and different amounts of pieces too.This fuzzy felt pets sets one I have played with alongside children, I think this set has been available for several years now. In the fuzzy felt pet set you get a  flocked felt backing board and some  cut  reshaped  pet shapes  there is a horse a cat, dogs rabbits, fish , birds there are also a  few pieces of  felt shaped like grass tufts and a tree trench and some leaves. All these pieces are different colours not always appropriate colours a red rabbit for example. There are between 20 and 30 shaped pieces in this set.All that you need to do to make a picture is place the felt pieces on the   flocked board and they will stick on. The pieces are easily removed so you can change reposition the pieces.  When you have finished the picture put the board back in the box you need not take all the felt animals of it.  But if you do the set will be ready for when you next want to make a picture. This fuzzy felt can be used time and time again to make new picture designs it is quite durable... The pieces of fuzzy felt are quite small so  maybe not for children who mouth and eat toys  maybe  supervise those children who do yeukk soggy felt pieces are horrid I know I have removed them from childrens mouths.  This set is good when you are doing an animal or pet topic with early year   s children. These fuzzy felt preshaped pies are good for less able children who can not reproduce a picture of an n animal on their own. They are easy to put on the board. I have used a felt board with animals to illustrate a story. You can buy this Fuzzy felt pets set at http://www.toysdirect.com/ for    5.99     ::::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6852948:4:::6852948:4:::6773138:4:::6773138:4:::6844462:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6657747:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sacla Italia Classic Green Basil Pesto::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::28.08.2010::::    I am particularly fond of this Sacla Basil pesto. It is available in a 190g glass jar at Tesco   s Sainsbury   s and Occado for    2.05.  A jar contains enough for 4 people. If you only use a little of the pesto from the jar then it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to 2 weeks.   Twist open the cap and have a sniff of this green pesto sauce as well as its green  colour it does smell green smells of Basil and pinekernals.  It is not a smooth sauce it has texture but not large lumpy bits in it.This Sacla basil pesto contains Sunflower Seed Oil, Italian Basil (36 ), Grana Padano Cheese, Cashew Nuts, Sea Salt, Glucose, Pecorino Romano Cheese, Crushed Pine Kernels, Flavourings, Potato. The basil pesto sauce is thick it is green and you can see the fibres of the plants and chopped pine kernels.  This pesto sauce does taste of Basil its quite intense, ingredients include Sunflower Seed Oil, Italian Basil, Grana Padano Cheese, Cashew Nuts, Sea Salt, Glucose, Pecorino Romano Cheese, Pine nuts, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Potato Flakes, Lactic Acid as Acidifier, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. There are 438k Cal per 100g Now I love Basil with tomatoes so made some stuffed tomatoes with this basil pesta sauce. As a starter for a meal with friends. I took the top of a tomato and removed the seeds then filled with some basil pesto that I had mixed with some ricotta and parmesan cheese. Sorry I do not have a recipe can not remember exact amount. This makes good stuffed mushrooms too. A quick easy tasty meal to make is just to cook some pasta and add some of this basil pest straight from the jar. There are many recopies at http://www.sacla.co.uk/recipes  and Sacla make many different jars of Pest and sauces for Italian meals.     ::::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::5505847:4:::5505847:4:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6854894:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5414290:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6853663:4:::5696535:4:::5696535:4:::6657747:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::6378505:4:::6773138:4:::6773138:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6368802:4:::6368802:4:::5604945:4:::5604945:4:::6775406:4:::6775406:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6145850:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6852763:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6474927:4:::6834688:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Gelert 12 Led Wind-up Lantern::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::28.08.2010::::     This Mini Gelert 12 LED Wind up Lantern is one I have owned for a couple of years and taken on several weeks camping trips. It is possible to buy a standard lantern too but we thought the mini would suit us. This lantern can be bought at http://www.johnscross.co.uk/products/Gelert-12-Led-Windup-Mini-Lantern-.html for    19.56 http://www.jacksonscamping.com/12-led-wind-up-mini-lantern/p377 are selling it for    15.99. We bought this wind up lantern to save on batteries.  Mainly we did this to be environmentally friendly but also we did this to save running out of battery when you need a light and have no replacement battery.This lantern is quite an attractive lantern style. It has a thick black plastic handle, this also has a black hook attached this hook is so the lantern can be hung up. The top of the lantern is also black plastic covered. The LEDS (light-emitting diode} are surrounded by a see through plastic casing and a steel cage. The light that is emitted from the Leds illuminates 360 degrees. This is ideal especially if you are sharing a light to see by. Now to prepare this lantern you first need to charge it by using the lead with a jack plug this into the socket on the lantern then plug the other end in to an electric supply. This needs to be done for about 8 hours this will give you 3 or 4 hours of light.  We have a connector so we can plug ours into the car battery via the cigarette lighter. While you are charging your lantern from the electric supply switch the lantern off. . To keep   the lantern charged up you wind the black handle clockwise. It is charged by a dynamo battery. (Like my old bike in the 60   s I pedalled to get illumination then).  The instructions say you get 15 minutes of light from 1 minutes winding. What I tend to do is wind it up fairly often when I have a spare minute or two. 3 AA batteries will fit into a small compartment on this lamp for those occasions when you have not recharged the lantern or your arms ache too much to wind. To switch on there is a push on and off switch. Now how much light does this give? Well we find it fine to illuminate the area where my husband and I are sitting together, its fine for a group of four sitting talking at night so you can see who is talking. It will light the inside of our small tent although it is dimly. This lantern ideal for those dark night trips to the campsite toilet. It   s fine for finding things in the suitcase /rucksack. Now reading, no this does not really give enough light to read comfortably I use a head torch when reading and camping. The information says it is waterproof   I have not really tested this out but it is probably shower proof so you can get to and from the toilet in the rain. As I said we have had this lamp a few years now and used it several weeks in each year and also occasionally use it at home.  This lamp does not get knocked about or dropped with us and should last us a few more camping trips yet.      ::::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6702243:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5414290:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::6368802:4:::6368802:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6834688:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5633146:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6474927:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Pink Spotty Toaster::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::26.08.2010::::    This pink spotty toaster from the Early Learning Centre costs 8 pounds with it you can make mummy and daddy or teddy and dolly some toast.  Well you can pretend to.The Early Learning Centre was purchased by Mothercare in June 2007   you can now buy early learning centre toys at the Early Learning Centre or at Mothercare on or off line motherThis spotty toaster matches the pink spotty tea set and the pink spotty apron, what a lot of spots. If you do not like pink the ELC make this in blue so it   s up to you. My granddaughter has this toy toaster it is suitable for a child aged over 2 years old. This toaster is made of plastic It is quite durable suitable for home or nursery school. It is a chunky toaster takes 2 slices of plastic bread it is pink coloured with large purple, white or green spots on it. There are 2 slices of toy plastic bread/toast with this set. You can insert these into the toasting slots at the top of the toaster easily. That   s right push them down just like you do with a real toaster.There is a dial on the front which is quite easy to grasp and turn this has 3 spots on it so you can lightly toast or toast your bread longer.  Right turn the dial timer and get a plate ready wait for the toast to pop up there the timer went ping and up popped the toast. The toast is done perfectly every time no risk of burning this plastic toast. This toaster is good for imaginary play. If you were buying a present for a 2 3 or 4 year old then this would be good especially if someone else was buying the matching spotty tea set. Your child could have a lot of spotty Accessories as there is a pink or blue spotty ironing board.Would I recommend the toy toaster? Yes it   s a good sturdy toy toaster with play value. I personally prefer the blue.I cringe when I see so many pink toys designed for girls yes there are blue ones for boys too. I think it must be a rebellion against my age group who hated the sexist only girls like pink, blue is a boy   s colour. When my daughter was a baby she rarely wore pink now my granddaughter is smothered in it both clothes and toys.      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6723241:3:::5719918:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6852684:4:::6852684:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6739162:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6850650:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::3957:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6844462:4:::6378505:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6800944:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6757811:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5203100:4:::6834688:4:::6781956:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::SuperCook Hundreds&Thousands::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.08.2010::::    I bought a 113g tub of supercook hundred and thousands the other day to sprinkle on cakes and deserts. Tesco and Sainsbury   s both sell these for 85p Dr Oetker has been making these for many years now and the packaging is little changed. The company is German founded by Dr. August Oetker in 1891    they come in a plastic tub about 3 1/2 inches tall with red label. At the top of the tub is two openings one large one with tiny holes in for more precise sprinkling and positioning.The hundreds and thousands are tiny little balls made of Sugar, Wheat Starch, Glucose Syrup, Colours E104, E124, E129, E131, and Hydrogenated Vegetable Fat. The colours are red white, yellow pink green blue.  They really do not have much flavour just sweet  These    hundreds and thousands are ideal for decorating party foods. I use them on little iced buns sometimes if the grandchildren are visiting. I have used them on many birthday and Christmas cake. I have even sprinkled them on jelly, this was a bit of a mistake as after a while the colour just leaks out of the hundreds and thousands and you get a blotchy colour mess.Children love to use these for decorating their own cakes and biscuits. Ice some rich tea or digestive biscuits and while the icing still wet give your children the hundreds and thousands to sprinkle on.  Your children can put other decorations on too.Another cooking thing to do with children and hundred and thousands is make some fairy bread   let your children spread   soft butter or margarine on bread and then sprinkle hundreds and thousands on. These are great if you use a biscuit cutter to make shaped ones. Or dip the end of a plain breadsticks in melted chocolate and then in hundreds and thousands.These are just so many decorating ideas to tell you them all.  These hundreds and thousands are made by Super cook which is now part of Dr Oetker foods which was founded by Dr. August Oetker in 1891One word of warning try not to spill these on the floor  I once dropped a whole tub  all over the floor took ages to pick up al;l those little sweet balls they got everywhere.     ::::6796380:3:::6796380:3:::6831875:3:::6831875:3:::5646482:3:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6844462:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6845486:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5347743:4:::6145850:4:::6378505:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6739162:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3957:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6368802:4:::6368802:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6844626:4:::6844626:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Asics Lady Gel-Cumulus 12 Running Shoes::::Sports & Outdoors::::50::::very helpful::::25.08.2010::::    Since writing this review for dooyoo and then here my foot is better I no longer get pain when walking.Because I no longer need to wear the  innersoles which were measured for me and my trainers were developing a hole in the toe I got my feet measured and bought a new pair of Asics cumulus trainers as I have learnt to trust them. The pair I bought 1 size bigger than my size before my injury but 1 size smaller than when I had to wear inner soles. My current pair have a purple stripe on the side they cost    60 in a sale and after wearing them for a couple of weeks now I am happy with them.My new shoes are from Asics .Asics is a Japanese company making sports wear. You may or may not be aware that I suffer from a tendon injury f or years I am doing physio every day and have had an operation on it. I was advised by my pysio that trainers with a gel heel would ease some of the pain when walking I found that Asics make a trainer  Asics Gel Cumulus that seem to be the most comfortable. I recently bought a new pair. I have been wearing ladies but recently due to the operation I think my foot size has increased. I also have a wide foot the men   s fitting have wider feet. Wearing innersoles also takes up     a size. I believe Asics cumulus   ladies are not available in my size I am     a size to big so I had a men   s size shoe. I had not realized before men   s sizes are not the same as ladies, they are bigger.These running trainer shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have found.Sadly they can cost a fortune    85 in some shops, but luckily for me I found them at sports direct for    55.00 there is a local sports direct for me but they are also on line at http://www.sportsdirect.com . So much as I prefer the staff and service from our small local sports shop I bought mine a lot cheaper from Sports direct. About these shoes. They are a trainer really designed for running.  I am a bit disappointed to find  the men   s only comes in a white trainer with a bright blue flash I do not really like the colour for my everyday purposes. I suppose for sports its fine.  The ladies design comes in a slightly better design, white with muted coloured stripe not the Day-Glo blue toes and side flash as on the men   s. However I am not proud I would rather be comfortable. These Asics cumulus 10 have a textile and synthetic upper a textile inner .An air mesh upper for breathability. They are a good shape with a moulded sole and a padded ankle for support.   The most important factor for me is the soles. These Asics trainers have AHAR    Heel Plug for maximum shock absorption. They have both rear foot and forefoot gel. If I was using these shoes running at night they have 3M reflective strips for low light visibility.I do wear innersoles molded by the hospital these make a big difference to the comfort of any shoe I wear. Burt if I were to compare wearing other shoes and my Asics trainers both wearing the innersoles I would defiantly say my Asics were by far the best I have worn the Asics without the innersoles and found them  fairly comfortable .  I would defiantly recommend these shoes both if you have a foot problem like me or not. They are supportive and comfortable. Suitable for running sports and comfort walking.I do long for the day I walk without pain and when I do I anticipate I shall remain loyal top this comfortable trainer.Here s one foot, here are two, Each one wearing a brand new shoe, So skip and dance all around the floor, That s what these new shoes are for.

       " '5247778::::Galt Wooden Rolling Pin::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::24.08.2010::::    Having worked in early years education situations for many years (more than I care to remember really) I have used many childrens rolling pins including these wooden ones from Galt. Galt say they are suitable for children aged 0+  Well although I am sure they are safe a one day old baby would not be able to hold one. And a small child will of course try to eat the play dough, so I think that about 2 would be the earliest age for this rolling pin really and certainly by three years old. I think by the time your child is 6 they will be better with a larger rolling pin. This wooden rolling pin measures about 20 cm end to end; I can not be accurate as I do not have one at home but at work. These wooden rolling pins are cylindrical and have rounded knobbly ends to them for your child to grip. They are easy to grasp and use. The wood is smooth and these rolling pins last many years. They are easy to clean; occasionally dough will get stuck in the groove where the end is rounded, wash in warm soapy water. These Galt rolling pins are ideal for both play dough and pastry. Play dough is such a great early years toy its sensory and is good to roll in the hands and shape into items but as your child progresses they will enjoy using tools with the dough cutters and rolling pins . Play dough is good for childrens manipulative skills their eye hand coordination. You can buy ready made play doh or make your own plenty of recipes on the internet. This Galt rolling pin is a good one for using both in a home or school setting. This rolling pin will cost 99p from http://www.galt-educational.co.uk      ::::6796380:3:::6796380:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6785596:3:::5604945:3:::5604945:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5719918:4:::6222560:4:::6739162:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6844462:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6145850:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6845780:4:::6845780:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6760116:4:::6760116:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6474927:4:::6378505:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6781956:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6852771:4:::6853148:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Toyday Animal Tongue Roller::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.08.2010::::    Tobar is a wholesaler of many little gifts  and toys I have seen many of them in party bags. I recently had the pleasure of seeing and playing with an animal tongue roller which is available from them in packs of 28 items or a Carton size: 504. You can buy less from http://www.mollymonkey.co.uk and I feel that they will be available off line in part shops or Hawkins sports.  These little animals cost around 80p upwards to about    1.00. Let me pass you one of these rubbery revolting feeling animals. There are about 5 different designs a green purple frog, a brown snail, a green turtle and another green and another orange animal that I an mot too sure about the species, These animals are about 7 cm long will fit nicely into the palm of a hand. These little animals are soft and they feel rubbery not a sensation that I really like, they would be great for sensory toy.  These animals are so easy to squeeze and yuck when you do so out pops their disgusting long tongue this is usually curled up I n their mouths. The children I know enjoy squeezing these animals to watch their tongues come out they enjoy scaring me with these revolting animals. I do not think these have a long play time but they are an ideal junk toy for a party bag, your chid will get bored with it quick but will amuse.     ::::5719918:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6198375:3:::6198375:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5217966:3:::5217966:3:::3957:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5719974:3:::6816870:3:::6816870:3:::5590684:3:::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6431958:3:::6431958:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6378505:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5940576:3:::5940576:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6844462:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6739162:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6779195:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6800944:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Pick Up Truck::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::22.08.2010::::    Can I pick you up in my little yellow truck? This little yellow truck is a little Tikes toy. My grandson likes to play with this when he goes to a soft play centre. My grandson aged 5 will soon be a bit big for it soon ok he will squash into it but not with a lot of comfort Let me describe this ride in toy. This little yellow truck is made of plastic it is a good sturdy toy. It has good rugged black wheels. At the play centre I watch several children climbing in and sitting on it. This truck has a covered cab with 2 opening doors. There is a steering wheel so your child can steer his way clear of obstacles. The steering wheel has a horn. The truck section is big enough for another 3 /4 year old to sit in. Adrian did like putting his nearly 2 year old sister in and driving around, we made sure we were near and very watchful. The open topped truck section has a drop down tail gate to make unloading the tool box that comes with the truck easy. A hard hat comes with the truck too. There is an opening petrol cap so children can fill up at the little Tikes petrol pump. The accessories mean that the children can play at being builders and workmen. I think this is a good ride in toy. It may be a bit large unless you have a large outside area. I think this toy would be perfect for a child s play scheme /playgroup/ nursery. This little Tikes truck will help a child practice their co-ordination and their physical skills. It is a good toy since they can use it with others to play imaginary games. This truck costs     79.99 at http://www.toysrus.co.uk  Amazon are also selling it for this price. So would I recommend this truck? Yes I would  Prices are current but I wrote this review a couple of years ago for doo yoo     ::::5719918:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5646482:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6222560:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5805376:4:::6845014:4:::6845014:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6852948:4:::6852948:4:::5719974:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6795103:4:::6795103:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6474927:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6845148:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6310942:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Turtle Sand Box::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::21.08.2010::::    There are still several weeks of summer sun and fun to be had, nothing better than to get the kids outside playing in the garden. A sand pit will give hours and hours of fun and it   s educational too. This Turtle sand pit from Little Tikes is one of several designs that I have used both at work or at home I think it is a really good one.This turtle shaped sandpit is made of plastic when empty it is easy to wash out and clean. Empty of sand you could actually use it as shallow water trays too, just make sure you are supervising young children if you use it as a water tray.This sand tray is basically circular with 4 small plastic feet and a head moulded out of the plastic tray. The head has 2 circular eyes white with black inner circles. The sand pit has a lid a green circular one with marking on it to look like turtle shell.  This lid fits quite securely the base has a couple of pegs on it which hold the lid in position. The lid is easy to remove and replace after play.If you are leaving a full sandpit outside a lid is really essential to keep those cats and other animals out. Stops the sand becoming a swamp in the rain too.The tray measures 1.09 x 1.19 x 0.38 cm two or three even 4 small children can easily sit around the sides of this sand pit to play. This pit will hold up to 70g of play sandThis is a very durable toy the one at work is years old the colour has not really faded much. Children love this sand pit, sand has many educational benefits. It is soothing and relaxing to play with sand.  Its early science learning the properties of sand,  pouring, sieving adding water  practising and perfecting their motor skills and hand-eye coordination by modelling items in the sand. . While playing with sand you can develop your child   s language with more and less talk to your child about what they are building motor skills and hand-eye coordination from pouring water and fashioning items in the sand.  Sand will stimulate creativity making castles, using shaped moulds making paterns with combs rakes and fingers.We use sand encouraging children to make marks and letter shapes in the sand with their fingers as a beginning to early writing skills. If in a group while playing at the turtle sand pit your child will learn social skills learning to share and cooperate with others. To enhance play in the turtle sand pit a few buckets and spades   a sieve are good you could use spoons or any pots. There are many sand toys available shaped ones to make moulded sand forms. I love sand play its one of the basic early play materials go on get on down there with the children have fun making sand pies.

A horse, a sheep, mummy duck and baby duck. These insert puzzle pieces do not have pegs, however they are quite easy for a child to grasp and position. Each piece is cut out around the animal shape. The yellow ducks swimming on a splash of blue pond, mummy duck has a small piece of PVC like fabric on her body. The cow with horns looks at you the cow is white with black splodges instead of one of the splodges there is a padded fabric piece. The pink pig with his curly tail has a fabric piece on his tummy to feel. The brown horse has a brown rough fabric piece inserted on his tummy. The sheep has a white furry fabric piece for his tummy, and then the farmer is wearing a blue fabric apron.On the puzzle tray under each piece is an identical picture of the animal that fits there except there is no picture on it. By the side of each puzzle position is the name of the animal printed on. I think this is a good puzzle the pictures bright and easy to recognise, the fabric on the puzzle pieces gives that extra interest. This puzzle will help your child in recognition of those animals and learning their names. We have this in the special needs school that I work at the fabric swatches on the puzzle pieces give another clue to the animal.

Hasbro make several upsy daisy dolls there is the mini one the talking one and the one that comes into school often is the bedtime one which does not talk.This doll is suitable for a child aged over 1 year old.This doll is about 11 inches/ 28cm tall. It looks just like the Upsy Daisy on the TV programme This Doll is at least a year old now it is well loved, I can tell by way it looks and that it comes into school with its hand in a child   s mouth.Upsy Daisy   s hands and face is a sort of pink colour her arms and legs colourful stripes. She has a flippy skirt with petals printed on it. Her face is a placid smiley one. Her hair strands of red yellow purple. The child that owns it does twiddle this soft fabric hair.This Upsy Daisy is advertised as a bedtime toy and I can see that it would be one that is cuddled and would help soothe a child to sleep. My daughter had a soft toy which she took everywhere she sucked her thumb and the arm of the toy with one hand and twiddled her hair with the other I can easily see a child doing this with this upsy daisy toy. You can buy this toy for    12.99 at http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/      ::::5719918:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6222560:4:::3957:4:::6852098:4:::6852098:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6368802:4:::6368802:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6378505:4:::6800944:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5790028:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This ball is an attractive one the picture of Winnie the Pooh Tiger and Eyore are on a blue sky and green grass background.  This ball is recommended for a three year old, but I know younger children than that play with a ball like this. Mookie also make a 15 cm diameter play ball too. This is tennis ball size its better for bat and ball games and catch games for older children. These balls are made of vinyl bright and light. This ball is quite durable and should last more than one year they bounce well. These balls are bright and light. Ball games are great fun outside in the summer in the garden park or beach and this attractive Winnie the Pooh ball will encourage your child to play.  These balls can be played with indoors too as long as you have enough space. Ball games are a great way to keep fit; they also are good for practicing that eye, hand/foot coordination skills. Also good for social skills. Learning to play with others in team games and sharing.   A good game is to get a bucket and get your children to try and throw the ball into it this makes a good party game.

       " '5247778::::Marks & Spencer Florentyna Foam Bath::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::19.08.2010::::    I had a mini bottle of this Florentyna foam bath for Christmas with some other Florentyna goodies from one of my pupils. It has taken me a long time to review it as I so rarely have a bath. (I shower) I just looked on line and it comes in a 250ml bottle usually this cost    3.50.  You can buy it in Marks on line or in the high street.The bottle comes in a card box with a pretty pink flower bloom on it. The Bottle is attractively shaped with a lid that looks like a rose flower. This bottle looks attractive stood on the bath side or in the cabinet..Have a little smell now mmm fresh clean floral with undertones of musk, pleasant not over flowery. This bath cream has the aroma of gardenia, jasmine, lily of the valley, orange blossom  Now let   s run the bath and twist and remove the top of this bottle. The liquid is a shimmery pearly pale pink and thick, runny enough to pour. Pour a small amount under the running bath tap and it will produce lots of bubbles. Now into the bath it   s warm and smell beautiful really luxurious the water soft. Now out of the bath and dried. This bath foam leaves the skin lightly fragranced and feeling very soft, the bath foam contains a moisturiser. Although I did use a little soap this foam cleanses too. I have used a few drops of this on my sponge to wash with when showering.  The fragrance and softness of my skin did last for quite a long time after. I really quite liked this bath foam so when it comes to Christmas please can I have some more as a present     ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5012148:3:::5012148:3:::6834688:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5687589:3:::5687589:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6755322:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6750576:3:::5604945:3:::5604945:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6737834:4:::6737834:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6800944:4:::6739162:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6701923:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6378505:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6534857:4:::6534857:4:::6845148:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6696039:4:::6696039:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6735325:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Val de Incles Andorra::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::18.08.2010::::    I have just returned from holiday, this year we visited friends in the Pyrenees then visited Andorra for a couple of days. What did we do in Andorra? Andorra is a very small country between France and Spain there are no taxes on good here so the price of goods is very cheap most people know Andorra as a shopping empire .However Andorra is a really beautiful mountainous country with many walking paths and mountain sporting facilities. One day we walked along the Incles Valley our friend who met us there ski s this area in the winter, but no snow in early August. This area is very popular with skiers in the winter. The Val de Incles is easy to find we entered Andorra from France and drove along the CG2V the main road through Andorra to Spain so you could easily get to the Val de Incles from the Spanish side too. We had been staying at Porte Puymorans the little road we were on joins the main road from Ax le Thermes abort 5k/ 2 miles from the Andorra border control. Her let me give you a word of warning it took us 45 minutes to get into Andorra the traffic was queed up from the passport /customs point right up to our junction and we could see the queue trailing a long way towards Ax on the E09. However we got through passport control and drove along the CG2V . We Entered Andorra and passed by Pas de le cassa where everyone stops to shop, we did not it was so busy cars parked everywhere and 10000 s of people we travelled on and past Soldeu to Arinsal. Coming in from Spain travel along the CG2V until you pass El Tartar. Coming through Soldeu to Spain so you could easily get to the Val de Incles from the Spanish side too. on the left hand bend just after the Bridge there is a narrow road leading along the river continue along this road for a few ,minutes at the end of the road there is a fairly large parking space, you will find this very busy and people do park along side the road before you get to this free parking.. Good map on the net is the Google map http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=andorra Walking boots on / trainers or good sturdy shoes will be fine. Day sac packed with Picnic, sun cream and waterproofs we set of along the path. It s an easy to follow path at least 1 metre wide some of the route is firm underneath some loose stones its all uphill following the river. This route is what I would describe as a family walk suitable for young children and older reasonably fit grannies and granddads. . It is a fairly busy route and we often passed or were passed by other walkers. The views along this walk are magnificent the mountains glorious. Our friend pointing out where he had skied in the winter. The flora is good here various pine trees and lots of thyme I found some bilberries. There were small pinks growing too, fireweed and many other mountain plants. I did not see but could hear Marmots. Looking in the sky I saw a Griffon Vulture soar other raptures might be seen here too, check birder sited to see the possibilities. The main attraction of this site to my husband was the butterflies many species were seen flying her in good numbers. We saw many grasshoppers and other insects too. The horseflies and midges were a bit of a pain though. Walking this rout we were never far from the river the sound of water tumbling over rocks and the waterfalls tumbling down the mountainside. There are several other mountain tracks leading from the main path but the main path leads on to a lake however we stopped just short of the lake as we needed to travel back to our friends in France. The walk to the lake from the parking takes about an hour if you are walking and not looking and identifying all the flora and fauna as you walk. Apparently by the lake there is The Juclar mountain hut with 50 beds but you would have to find info about this elsewhere as we did not get there. Before we went we trawled the internet for information and we found these sites helpful http://www.hola-andorra.com and http://www.takethefamily.com/where/andorra.php there are several other sites giving info so you could just put Val de Incles in your search engine      ::::5633146:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6222560:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6845148:4:::6701923:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5646482:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6603737:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6378505:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Toypost Skip Ball::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::13.08.2010::::    Come play skip ball with me we can borrow the ones from school. These skip balls are a bit different from the one on a shiny glittery hoop I reviewed a while ago. These balls on ropes are a bit more like the home made ones I played with in the 60 s. Basically this toy is a ball attached to a skipping rope that has a loop made with the opposite end to the ball end. These come in a variety of colours sparkly red, green, yellow blue, orange or purple plastic balls attached to different coloured twisted ropes green yellow red green purple red ropes. The balls have the attraction of a bell inside it. The rope is only 60cm /2 ft long so not long enough to get tangled This toy is suitable for a child aged 4+ children of 8 and 9 enjoy this toy and as an adult I have had fun reliving my childhood playground times. To play with this skip ball first you put your foot through the loop of rope and position it around one ankle. Then untangle the rest of the rope and twirl the ball around you on the floor. You hop skip every time the rope comes around under your other foot. You can keep enough momentum going by your hop skipping to keep that ball twirling for ages count how many times you can skip over the rope, with practice you will get better. You can do this on the spot or if you are really clever you will be able to travel across the playground doing this . This is good fun and will help your co ordination, it will, also help you keep fit in a fun way. These skip hop ropes and balls seem to be quite durable will at least last a season. Amazon is selling these for    5.95. They are also available directly from http://www.toypost.co.uk      ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6145850:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5719918:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6851095:4:::6851095:4:::6222560:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6735325:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6378505:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6800944:4:::6844462:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5790028:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6758896:4:::6758896:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6797137:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6696039:4:::6696039:4:::6840580:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Yellowmoon Dinosaur Temporary Tattoos::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::12.08.2010::::    The 5 year old boy was showing off his dinosaur tattoo to his friedDoesn   t that look cool he said the friend replied yes I want one.  Mum can I have a tattoo please? Ok says mummy how much. 50p said my daughter. My daughter was  running a face painting  stall at the school fete she also was doing tattoo   s now do not be alarmed these tattoos are temporary tattoos ones you apply with water and will easily wash off with soap and water. My daughter (or my grand child   s school) had bought some packs of temporary tattoos from Yellow moon. Yellow moon is a company which sells novelties and party products.  My school and I suspect many others receive catalogues from then. The yellow moon goods are also available from the website http://www.yellowmoon.org.uk.Now these dinosaur tattoos cost    3.99 for a pack of 36. In this pack was a large selection of different dinosaur tattoos with only about 3 repeats of the same dinosaur picture The dinosaur tattoo pictures came individually printed on a piece of white piece paper and covered by a see through cellophane type paper.  I guess the rectangular paper that the tattoo was on is about 5cm by 3 or 4 cm. The tattoo is of course smaller. These temporary tattoos are so easy to put on to skin. The children were mostly wearing tee-shirts so they would choose the dinosaur that they wanted and the cellophane covering the dinosaur was peeled of and Dino was put face down on the Childs arm The paper needs to be held still while water applied with a wet sponge this was held against the white paper for a while thoroughly wetting it. T he paper then removed and brightly coloured dinosaur revealed. The children were delighted with their tattooed arms it had not taken long. I do not know how long these temporary tattoos would last on unwashed skin. I know  my granddaughter  washed a temporary tattoo off in the bath that night, They are easy to remove just wash the  tattooed body with water and  the tattoo comes off , however I do know that I have seen children at school with tattoos on them that last several days , those children probably would not let water near them.. These temporary tattoos are suitable for over 3 year olds. These tattoos were a good simple fundraiser fun for the children; I can not find any reference to any allergic reactions but its best to get the parents permission before applying these.     ::::5633146:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6844462:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6310942:4:::6248607:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6781956:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6800944:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6739162:4:::6834688:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6850650:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ackerman Water flutes::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::11.08.2010::::    I expect we will get some more hot sunny summer days these water flutes are an ideal toy to add to the water play in the garden , all it needs is a jug of water to fill the flutes, They are also fun  in the bath. We have some at work for the indoor water tray and the swimming pool. These flutes are suitable for a child aged 3 and over. This set includes 5 water flutes and 3 colours coded waterproof music sheets. These flutes have a blue holder to hold the flutes separately this holder is plastic and will float. It is easy to pull out or push in a flute to this holder.The 5 flutes have different coloured mouth pieces and cap at the base of the flute.  The base is flat so the flutes will stand up on end. These are a bright red, green, and blue, orange, yellow. The middle flute tube is a clear see through plastic.  This tube has marking on it a, b, c, d, e, f, g the notes are colour coded. Fill the tube up to the level of the note you wish to play through the mouth piece. With each flute filled to a different note level you can play a variety of tunes.  When you finish playing with these flutes twist the base and it will release the water, leave it open then the flute tube will dry. Ours are a bit cloudy now due to lime scale build up they are difficult to get into and clean. The sounds that these flutes make are quite pleasant not ear piercing. If filled to the levels indicated for each note then the note played is fairly true and tunes played are recognisable.  The tunes on the cards are colour coded to match the flutes.   Two of the tunes are jingle bells and old Macdonald I can not remember the other. When played correctly these tunes are recognisable. Depending on the age and ability of your child you will get different play and sounds. These flutes are fun they encourage children to blow this is quite difficult for some children. Playing and blowing these flutes will strengthen mouth muscles that we use in speech.

       " '5247778::::6 Wooden Muffins in a Tray::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::10.08.2010::::     Do you fancy a little muffin with your cup of tea? These ones are a bit wooden not really edible. The muffins I am talking about are toy wooden muffins by Big jigs.   I have pretended to eat these cakes in an early year   s classroom. These muffins are presented on a wooden tray. The tray measures 12cm x 18cm x 5.5cm. This wooden tray has 6 circular indentations cut into it, looks like a muffin baking tray. This tray is ideal for keeping the cakes together it makes the house corner neater. Also As this wooden tray looks like the one mummy /daddy cooks cakes in then it is good for pretending to cook the cakes on in the pretend oven.  The six little muffins are about the size of a real muffin (little cake) they are a light brown colour. On top of each basic muffin is a small Velcro strip. The muffins will fit into any of the 6 spaces in the bun tray that comes with them. Each of these muffins has a wooden decorated icing top. These iced tops are interchangeable as each one is fitted to a Velcro strip. There are 2 lemon coloured tops with a red cherry on top, two white tops again with a red cherry on top, the last two have a strawberry pink topping with a few red sprinkles on. These little muffins are quite realistic. These are made from rubber wood plantation trees and any paint used is non toxic as are any stains and laquers that are used. These cakes are quite durable and should last several years. These little muffins are great for house play pretending to have tea and cake or good for in the toy shop or the caf   . They can be used for matching and counting. These little wooden cakes are suitable for children aged over 2 years old You can buy these little muffins from http://www.littlefishtoys.co.uk/ for    7, 99 or from http://www.playmerrilytoys.co.uk for    8.95.

Yes     ::::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6145850:4:::5590684:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6844462:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6378505:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6757811:4:::6821871:4:::6821871:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6786865:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6850650:4:::6816341:4:::6842412:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Spotty Tea Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::09.08.2010::::    The ELC are selling a spotty tea set for    8 instead of    10. This tea set also available at boots or mother care for    8.00 too. I think this tea set has been available for several years now I have played with it often in play centres or school. This tea set is available in either pink with spots or blue with spots .The spots on the tea set a fairly large. There are about 6 spots on the teapot and 4 spots on a cup. The different colours on the different coloured tea sets red , blue  and white on the blue set red lime green and white on the  pink one.I have only seen this tea set unpackaged so I do not know what the packaging is. This is a tea set for 4 persons with 1 teapot with lid. 1 sugar bowl with lid, 1 milk jug and 4 cups and 4 saucers 4 teaspoons also come with this set as does 1 box of fair trade teabags. This tea set is suitable for children aged over 2 years old. The size of this tea set is good its child sized the gap in the cup handles just big enough for my fingers to get in a child can hold it as you would a normal cup.  This tea set is made of a good durable plastic and should  if bought for a child when they are 2 or 3 last their interest in playing with it . The upper age limit I would say is 7 or 8 years old.  This tea set is attractive to children and they will get pleasure playing with it. Children love to pretend to be their parents and play house. I have been offered many cups of tea and coffee in this tea set and although children will be happy pouring pretend drink from it why not fill the tea pot with water or squash and let them have a proper tea party in the garden. I have seen children arrange their dollies and teddies and have a drink with them both in the house corner and outside for teddy bear picnics. These are good for play they encourage social play learning how to share. Yes this spotty tea set either the pink or the blue is a good one.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5633146:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6844462:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::6786865:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6145850:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6757811:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6845780:4:::6845780:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6781956:4:::6739162:4:::6844626:4:::6844626:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5790028:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6735325:4:::6850502:4:::6850502:4:::6845014:4:::6845014:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Toyday Traditional & Classic Toys Glitter Skip Ball::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::07.08.2010::::    Its quite a while since I have seen this toy but a couple of years ago I saw one fairly regularly in the school hall or playground. I checked on line and this ball skip is still available at Amazon for    3.99 or at http://www.toyday.co.uk where it also costs    3.99. This is a toy suitable for outdoor play. It is a pink plastic ball measuring 7cm attached by a purple and white rope to a glittery purple hoop/ring. This hoop fits over your ankle I am sorry I can not tell you the diameter of the hoop but it fits over an ankle and big enough to leave space but not too big that it gets in the way of the other foot of a child the hoop will just go over an adults ankle and just be big enough to turn. The way you use this is to swing the ball round one foot and jump the other foot over the string attach    to it. Once the ball gets swinging round keep the momentum going jumping over and over the ball. This is quite good fun to do , its quite difficult really to keep the ball swinging round fairly fast and jump over it at the same time . This is a good playground or garden toy. This ball and ring helps develop foot coordination and balance. I think it is suitable for a child 5 upwards. This is quite a durable toy should last a few skipping seasons. It s a fun way of getting some exercise. This would make a good cheap gift for someone. Unless you have a large hall like a school hall I would advise that it s not an indoor toy as the ball will bash into furniture. .      ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6701923:3:::6755322:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6145850:3:::5646482:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6367664:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6757811:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6786865:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6800944:4:::6844462:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6845780:4:::6845780:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::5414290:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6830270:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6847751:4:::6847751:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6378505:4:::6771611:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Mookie 3 Juggling Balls::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::06.08.2010::::    Before we begin I shall have to tell you I am not much good at juggling can manage 2 balls but 3 balls a lot more difficult. We have a set of these 3 juggling balls from Mookie at school/work. Mookie is a company which makes many toys. This pack of three balls will cost  quot;1.99 from http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk and also from http://www.amazon.co.uk. These balls are a good size to hold in your hand they are soft balls. I am not sure exactly what they are filled with but its small particles seed, beans or grains of polystyrene, I think its seed. These balls are made with a bright fabric divided into 4 segments two silver segments a shiny blue one and a shiny red segment too. These balls are quite attractive and feel good to hold. The manufacturer says they are suitable for a child aged over 3 years old. Unfortunately Mookie have not made these balls with a very strong fabric and they loose their colour the shiny fibres come out and look grey. So although they might withstand gentle juggling they are not suitable for bat ball or throwing games really. However the balls do stay together and not come apart at the seams. Trying to juggle is difficult but fun, good for eye hand coordination skills and motor control. These balls are quite good to use as a sensory ball to feel squeeze and roll. When new the bright shiny colours are attractive and eye catching the little particles can be felt inside the fabric these are good for a child with limited hand use to hold and stimulate their senses. It is just such a shame these are not more durable. However they are only cheap Amazon has the set of 3 balls for    1.99 http://www.mailorderexpress.com has them for    1.99 too      ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5414290:3:::6785596:3:::6739162:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5439461:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::6811202:3:::6811202:3:::6820455:3:::6835060:3:::6835060:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6847079:4:::6847079:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6844462:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5790028:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6773138:4:::6773138:4:::6771611:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6378505:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6816341:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This ball is a Mookie toy. Mookie is a company that make outdoor play toys balls, bats, skipping ropes .skittles and many more. This postman Pat ball comes either in Red or Blue, we have both at school but my classroom one is blue. On these balls are large pictures one just of [Postman Pats head and shoulder with a waving arm one of Postman Pat and Jess holding a bag of mail. These balls look attractive and cheery. This play ball is 23 cm this is a really good size for many games .It is light they are made of a durable material and bounces well. Our ball is about a year old now and gets kicked about in football games as well as bounced and thrown a lot. The children love playing with the postman Pat ball they enjoy teasing me and kick it over the fence so I have to go around the school and retrieve it. The ball often gets tossed up onto the roof and we have to wait till the wind blows it down again. This ball can be bought on line at http://www.lambstoys.co.uk for    3.00 http://www.amazon.co.uk have it in red for    5.95 Blue ones at https://www.mailorderexpress.com for    1.95. There are several on line shops selling this ball for under a fiver. Although I have not seen this ball in the high street I imagine you could get it in many toy or department toys. Would I recommend this Postman Pat ball? For a child that likes postman Pat yes. It seems durable and the children love it. This ball would be perfect for garden, park or beach play this summer. A great way to keep your children and you fit. Great for eye hand eye control or eye foot control.

       " '5247778::::Tovao Fortune Teller Fish::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::20.07.2010::::    Tobar fortune teller fish. I wonder if any of you have had your fortune told by a fish? Well I have several times. The fish that has told my fortune is the Tobar fortune teller fish. Now this Fish is one that you can buy from joke and party shops and you might find one in a Christmas cracker.Now this little red fish comes in a white packet with red writing the packet about 8 cm long  . The packet shows a fish cavorting in a sea with a red banner that has white writing proclaiming fortune teller. Tear open the packet carefully and you will find a red fish about 6cm long by 2cm wide it is made from a thin plastic   y tissue kind of paper. As well as the fish you will find a slip of paper with instructions and explains predictions.  Now eager to find what the future holds place the fish on the palm of your hand and wait a moment or two. Now you will see some movement the fish will try to curl up, it might wiggle or flip and depending on how tight the fish curls your fortune will be revealed. I can not remember the precise predictions and which strength of curl predicts which event but I seem to remember that if the fish curls completely up then you are in love, I seem to remember other predictions were about independence and fickleness, are you jelous or passionate .. So  I can remember trying discretlwey  to make my hands warm in front of the fire when I was younger to make the fish curl as much as it could.I think that the warmer your hand the more the fortune telling fish will curl up. I remember on several occasions we pronounced the person who was having their fortune told by the fish dead as the fish was completely flat or nearly anyway on a cold hand.   Mow wether you believe the fortune that the fish tells you  is up to you but personally I think its just a bit of fun. These fish do survive fr nore than one fortune telling as they uncrl when removed from a hot palm. After use you could put then in an envelope anf keep safe for another time ..

       " '5247778::::Britains 174 - Series I Land Rover::::Family::::40::::helpful::::18.07.2010::::    This Britain s 174 - Series I Land Rover was bought a couple of years ago new for my grandson a birthday present if I remember correctly. This is a fantastic toy for a child who has a model farm. This is a 1:32 scale model of the real land rover. Equally good for an adult who makes model scenes, ideal for a farming exhibition display. The recommended age is over 3 years old This little dark green land has clear and cleans the steering wheel. This land rover has yellow hard top which is detachable. I have occasionally found the yellow hard top piece loose in the car box it seems to come of easily. This land rover has 4 black wheels which have a suspension action. This toy land rover gets played with quite a bit by the grand children. It is slightyy scratched. However this land rover is well made and should last may play hours. My grandchildren enjoy travelling the toy farm with it, I have seen farm tools (toys) being loaded on its back, I have seen plastic animals being made to climb on boost. With these Britain s toys you child will lose hin/herself in their imagination. I think this is a good buy. Britain s toys are very durable, which is just as well with the amount of bashing and crashing we get into. This toy landrover is available from 12.98 from http://www.amazon.co.uk/ or from http://uk.shopping.com/ also    12.98      ::::5719918:3:::6157866:3:::6157866:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5735532:3:::5735532:3:::6802070:3:::6017016:3:::6017016:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6842363:3:::6842363:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6518541:3:::6518541:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6845273:3:::6845273:3:::5439461:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6820455:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::6755322:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6781956:4:::6816341:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6830048:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Classmate Highlighters::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::17.07.2010::::    I have a classmate highlighter here next to me it is one my husband uses for his work. I have often used this and the Stabilo highlighters too. I am not sure if you can buy the classmate highlighter in the high street anywhere I looked at Smiths and Ryman s website but could not find any. I do know they are available from http://www.nesarnold.co.uk and http://hope-education.co.uk These companies have internet sites and also catalogues which most school have. The price of these highlighters is    1.49 for a pack of six (just under each) at both sites Stabilo highlighters cost for a pack of 10 is    2.09 (about 21p each) from http://www.nesarnold.co.uk/secondary. However in Smiths I notice a pack of 4 Stabilo highlighters are    3.74. These packs are not of fluorescent pens. Theses classmate highlighter pens are available in a variety of pack sizes or can be bought singularly. I also notice that classmate make a thinner highlighter pen with a 2, 55 mm nib Picking up these pens it s difficult to know which is which the classmate highlighter pen is about 10 cm long just over 2 cm wide and 1 and a bit cm thick. (So is the Stabilo pen) There is a slight difference at the end of the highlighter the stabile one is smooth the Classmate one has a ridge about     a cm from the end and the end of the pen is slight smaller in circumference. The barrel of the classmate pen is the same colour of its ink (so is the Stabilo one) The black cap is about 3 cms long (so is the Stabilo one) The colours that I know are yellow, blue orange , red , pink and green. The nib of these highlighters is a 55 mm chisel tip. It is easy to write or to highlight words using these pens. They leave a good colour which highlights your words it does not cover the ink over so you can not see the writing. The classmate highlighter pens do highlight work well making it east to see the words that you choose to highlight. I would say there is little to choose between the performance of either the classmate or Stabilo pen. I am afraid I can not really comment on their longevity as I can not judge how much I have highlighted before this pen runs out of ink . However this classmate highlighter pen that I was using today seems to have been around and used by both myself and hubby quite a bit. Would I recommend these highlighters? Yes they are a fine pen      ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6785596:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5439461:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6847439:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5816422:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5347743:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6757811:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6760116:4:::6760116:4:::6816341:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6618597:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6830048:4:::6378505:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bigjigs SanToys-Small Finger Labyrinth::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.07.2010::::    This labrinth bead on wire frame toy is one I have seen and used with children in a special needs school. I have seen and used several other bead frames too. This bead frame is made by santoys the company name is Santa s toys abbreviated. This small finger labyrinth wooden toy measures 150 x 200 x 195 mm. It has a wooden base, the wood having being grown on Plantation trees. Sturdy wires are attached these go to the opposite diagonal corner these wires are non toxic coated. One wire is coated in blue the other in red. These wires curl and twist their way to the other corner of this frame. The wires are strong thick do not bend easily. There are 16 wooden beads attached to these wires 8 on each wire. These wooden beads are coloured red, blue, orange and yellow. The beads are different shapes some spherical some circular discs some square discs some triangular discs. The holes in the centre of these discs are quite large they easily glide over the covered wires. This is a well made bead frame. The one at work is several years old and is bright and attractive. This toy is suitable for a 3 year old. Also it is suitable for older children with special needs. This bead frame encourages fine motor skills and eye hand coordination. It encourages sense of direction and logical thinking. Good for colour and shape recognition too. Children like to fiddle and move these beads along the wired it is quite absorbing. If you want a bead labyrinth then I would recognize this one it is well made, durable and the children like it.      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6378505:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6693128:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6829986:4:::6829986:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6816341:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6781956:4:::6220775:4:::6220775:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Melissa&Doug Under the Sea Jigsaw Puzzle::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::14.07.2010::::    I am talking about the Melissa and Doug 24 piece under the sea puzzle, Melissa and Doug also make an under the sea 100 piece floor puzzle.This puzzle is suitable for a child aged 3 and over. The picture of the fish under the sea is not babyish so is age appropriate for an older child who because of disabilities can not do more difficult puzzles.The puzzle pieces fit together well with those male female joining connectors.   This puzzle is one that comes on a natural thin wooden tray on the tray is Melissa and Doug and the words crafted by hand. This tray has no picture of the puzzle on it is just a tray that the puzzle fits in. This tray is handy for storage and also makes it easier to do the puzzle, keeps the pieces in position better.  The puzzle measures 0.4 quot; x 11.75 quot; x 15.75  The picture on this puzzle is a bright one of under the sea it is blue with colourful sea creatures a pink jelly fish, a red crab, an orange crab, a pink star fish, a yellow seahorse with white tummy, a purple sea anemone. There are 3 standard fishes tpp  a grey shark, a blue one a sword fish I think and another blue fish too. The background in the picture is a sand sea bottom blue sea with a wavy line and blue sky on top. Although this puzzle is quite durable the puzzle picture is a laminate paper type that has been stuck onto the wooden puzzle. This paper does begin to peel after a lot of use /misuse. I like this puzzle it fits in with the summer or seaside theme or the natural world.  Puzzles are great for practising and perfecting fine motor skills and visual perception. This puzzle is suitable for both home and school use. Melissa and Doug do make some good puzzles they are American based.  This puzzle is available from http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B00272N8HG/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8 condition=new for    7.99 or from http://www.tinytotshop.co.uk.

       " '5247778::::Flair Sylvanian Families Celebration Brown Rabbits Family::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.07.2010::::    My granddaughter received these as a birthday present this year.  The brown rabbits were first made in 1987 and until  recently this brown rabbit family has had only 5 members now there are 7 as the older brother and sister figures have now been added.  The family consists of Father, Mother, Older Brother and Sister Younger Brother and Sister and tiny baby sister. Available separately is a baby brother and   the 2 grandparentsThe box my granddaughter received these toy rabbits in has some information on the back which tells you about each rabbit its name and a few details about their personalities and what they do. Although we are told this is to aid your Childs pretend play with these figures I personally think it hampers it. Let your child use their imagination make up their own names and what the rabbits like to do. This is how they get the name celebration brown family as the accompanying literature about the rabbits says that they like partying singing and dancing These are designed as a childrens toy but I know some adults do collect them. The little rabbit   s yes they are quite small Mum and Dad are about 6cm tall. The rabbits are completly brown and are covered in a flock to make them look and feel as if they are covered in rabbit hair. Each rabbit is fully clothed baby in a romper suit, the children in dresses and dungarees Dad is wearing dungarees too; mum wears a dress and a pinny. These clothes can be removed put on and off the rabbits many times they seem to be quite well made. The arms and legs of these rabbits move and you can pose the rabbits. Their paws are shaped so they will hold the many accessories that are made for these rabbits This toy is suitable for children over 4 years old. My granddaughter loves playing with these rabbits her squeaky voice talking for then, she loves taking them for rides in the Sylvania car and  the rabbit family is made to live a life not dissimilar to her own they go to school they have thier meals they play and fight together This wildwood family is adorable; do be careful of thier tails though as some other Sylvania rabbits we had did lose thier tails too easily. I think my granddaughter will have many happy playhours with these and they are not babyish so I immagine she will get many years if enjoyment      ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5781064:3:::5781064:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6847439:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::3957:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6757811:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6378505:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6800944:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::5362774:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6816341:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6239059:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5633146:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6783582:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6833727:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It is the Melissa and Doug on the go puzzle. This puzzle is one I have supervised children making; it is a 12 piece tray puzzle. Each piece has interlocking male and female connectors, the tray that this puzzle fits does not have the same picture as the puzzle on its base it is just a plain wooden base. This tray does make it a bit easier to make the puzzle giving it a firm even base on which to make the puzzle. Also the puzzle stays together easily and the tray helps make storage easier. This puzzle is recommended for children aged 3 and over but I think a younger child of around 2 would be happily occupied with this puzzle maybe having some help to begin with, I work with special needs children , this is a good puzzle for the children who are older as the pictures are not babyish. The pieces of this puzzle are about 6cm square so they are a good size for little fingers, not too fiddly. The picture on this puzzle is a transport scene with a red car, a Yellow school bus, a green lorry, a couple of boats, a train, an aeroplane and a helicopter. The colours are good quite bright and the background id a grey road a blue sea and a blue sky with a few white clouds. The picture is good one the children like with things they are familiar with. Lots to talk about on the puzzle, this puzzle is ideal if we are doing a transport theme. Puzzles are good educational tools and this is a very good puzzle. Your child will practise their fine motor control, their eye hand coordination, their spatial awareness. After a few times of doing this puzzle and working out where the pieces go your child will remember where the pieces go and find the puzzle easier. This puzzle is suitable for home ,or early years education facility it really is hard wearing. You can buy this puzzle at http://www.amazon.co.uk/ gp/offer-listing/B002I2NE7O/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8  condition=new for    4.99 with no delivery charges.

This number sequencing puzzle is quite easy to put together, as well as a maths resource it is also good for practicing those fine motor skills. Jigsaws are good for childrens concentration skills. This jigsaw is a good well made jigsaw it is very durable should last many, many play hours I think the one I played with several years old. The children who I watch doing this jigsaw sit happily doing it. They get that sense of achievement on completion. We talk about the jigsaw count the numbers and the things the pictured children are carrying. We sometimes talk about the pictured children. I like that because there are pictures of children from different ethnic backgrounds it means that all my children can relate to the pictured children.Also that they can see pictures of other ethnic children in their everyday setting. Would I recommend this jigsaw? Yes     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6783582:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6845780:4:::6845780:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6755322:4:::6739162:4:::6145850:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6820455:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6841262:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6751010:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6792193:4:::6792193:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Yellow Moon Fantasy Fairy Tattoos::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::10.07.2010::::    I went to my grandsons school summer fete last weekend, my daughter was face painting and putting temporary tattoos on children. My granddaughter decided she wanted a fairy tattoo applied.  Theses tattoos were bought from the company yellow moon. You may have seen their catalogues from your child   s school or other concern that fund raises. There is an on line catalogue at http://www.yellowmoon.org.uk. These fairy tattoos are available in 12 designs they come in a pack of 36 that cost    3.99., that makes each tattoo cost just over 11p each. These tattoos are quite pretty the fairies are brightly coloured. My granddaughter chooses her fairy. The tattoo comes on a white piece of paper and covered by a see through cellophane type paper. I have not  got  one with me now but  I guess the  rectangular paper that the tattoo was on is about  5cm by 3 or 4 cm   c . The tattoo is of course smaller.  To apply the tattoo I peeled of the cellophane covering the fairy and positioned the white paper with the fairy on face down against my granddaughters arm. I then wet a sponge that my daughter has and pressed it against the white paper wetting it. I then pressed fairly hard and counted to 30 holding the tattoo against my granddaughters arm.  With bated breath I gingerly removed the white paper and    .. Yes it had worked it was successful and on my granddaughters arm was a pretty coloured fairy, she could not wait to show it of to her her family and friends. These fantasy fairy tattoos are easy to apply. I do not know how long these temporary tattoos would last on unwashed skin. My granddaughters  washed  most of hers off in the bath that night, They are quite easy to remove just wash the  tattooed body with soap and water and  the tattoo comes off , however I do know that I have seen children at school with tattoos on them that last several days ,  These temporary tattoos are suitable for over 3 year olds.Several children had tattoos done at this school fete they were quite a good fundraiser. Yellow moon also have other styles of temporary tattoos available.       ::::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6820455:3:::6717480:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6783582:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6830905:4:::6830905:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5690767:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6378505:4:::5790028:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6759284:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6310942:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6750576:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I work in a special needs school and one of the classes that I have worked in had this puzzle set. This Galt baby puzzle pets has 6, 2 piece puzzles in the yellow box. The pets are a fish, a cat, and a dog. A tortoise. A  Rabbit and a mouse. These puzzles are suitable for children 18 months and over. The puzzles are made from a thick card with wipe clean surface each puzzle measures about 12.5cm x 15cm (5 quot; x 6 quot;). Each animal puzzle is cut out around the shape of the animal, no straight sides. These puzzles are brightly coloured will be attractive to a toddler. However I do have a bit of a problem with these puzzles:- the rabbit is blue, the  dog purple with spots , the mouse pink with a blue tail  the tortoise a green shell with yellow body the fish red and yellow stripes the cat a bit better is an orange colour.   The Orchard toys 2 piece pet puzzles are more realistic coloured.However the colour of the animals does not seem to put my pupils off they do these puzzles without much thought to their colour. Having said that you can use the colours to help with colour recognition skills.The puzzles are quite chunky easy to hold and fit together. These puzzles will help  encourage early matching skills, first maybe just give your child one 2 piece puzzle at a time to do then increase the number of puzzles and mix them up for your child to sort and make. They will also help your child practice manual dexterity and eye hand coordination. You could use these puzzles when talking about animals, talk about the animal puzzles it is good for your child   s language development.  To buy this box of galt pet baby puzzles it will cost you    4 from http://www.amazon.co.uk and also    4.00 from http://www.lambstoys.co.uk , so you should be able to find it to buy around this price.

We were playing the Galt game whose tail which is similar to the Galt game whose house which I have also reviewed. Whose tail is a box of ten two piece puzzles? These puzzles are of wild animals. The 2 piece puzzles fit with simple male female cojoining pieces, only the correct pieces will fit together. Each rectangular puzzle is about 18mm by 100 mm.The puzzles are made of a thick card with a wipe clean finish. They are sturdy puzzle pieces and should last a long time. All of the puzzles have a white background. On one puzzle piece is a picture of the face or front of the animal that does not show its tail. The other piece of the puzzle is the rear end of the animal showing the tail. Now to complete a puzzle you have to match the animal   s front to its tail. I have not got this puzzle at home, it is at work and I cannot remember all the animals but there is an Elephant, a Zebra, a tiger, and a part amongst them. The pictures are real animals. This box of 2 piece puzzles is suitable for a 2 to 4 year old and they may not be familiar with all the animals so you may have to give them some guidance. With a younger child you may wish to only use a couple of the puzzles at a time.  These puzzles give you the opportunity to teach your child the names of these animals and their names. It will also teach them that some animals have tails, look at the animals pictured on the puzzle pieces and talk about the other body parts   how many legs ears eyes whiskers and so on.  I do liker this set of 2 piece puzzles. Ideal for when we are doing an animal topic.

I believe this is quite an old toy which Galt still sell. This magnetic toy from Galt has a RRP of    9.95. I found it on line at http://homeshopping.24studio.co.uk for    6.99 It is also available at several other on line shops at around that price. This toy is recommended for children aged 3 to 6 years old. Suitable for the foundation stage and key stage 1 and 2 This toy from Galt is basically a metallic tray which magnets will stick to and 43 assorted coloured magnetic shapes. The black metal tray is 27cm x 20cm not really very large, There are a good selection of shapes 2 sizes of circles 2 sizes of triangles some square shapes and several different sized rectangle shapes. These shapes come in a range of colours red, purple, yellow, green. There colours quite bright. The shapes though are quite small I think some so small it would be possible to swallow them. These magnetic shapes can be placed onto the metal tray where they will stick by magnetism. Your child can arrange them to make a picture. There are a few designs included for your child to copy. This toy will encourage children to experiment with the shapes good for maths and also for science and magnetism. This toy is quite durable. However I feel that the pieces too small and full price a bit expensive really      ::::6733652:2:::6733652:2:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6760116:4:::6760116:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5203100:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::3957:4:::6759284:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6800944:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Gardman Raffia::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::04.07.2010::::     Earlier this year on a visit to the local garden centre I bought a 50g hank of Gardman Raffia. I recently requested a category for this and Dooyoo entered this one The Raffia at http://www.theonlinegardener.com is the 50g Gardman hank. I paid around the    2.00 mark for the raffia when I bought it at my local garden centre on line at http://www.theonlinegardener.com it cost    2.49 at http://www.selections.com it costs     2.19. This raffia is a natural light brown colour. This raffia hank is made up of many long strings of raffia not one continuous one. Each  quot;string quot; is made up of several strings of fibres. I prefer to use natural products to tie my plants up with. I use this raffia when tying my vegetables or flowers to supports. I have some tying up my tomato plants at the moment I also have some tying up my broad beans. This raffia is soft yet strong it will not cut into plant stems like wires or plastic ties. I think raffia to tie up plants is more attractive than plastic ties. Each length of Raffia is long and I often cut it into smaller pieces for my needs. If I have used a long length in the greenhouse I have managed to use it for a couple of years and I notice plants in the garden I tied back with raffia still have the raffia after a year or two. Although if used for a craft project that will not get wet will last a lot longer. Raffia is biodegradable and probably wont last much longer than this if on an outside plant. Raffia s is useful for art too; I make corn dollies and use raffia to tie the necks of corn. I have attempted to make dolls, scarecrows from raffia too they are ideal for autumn. I have used raffia to tie a bow on a gardening gift for a friend. Raffia is also used to make place mats hats and display see http://www.ehow.com/how_6080826_make-hawaiian-raff ia-doll.html or http://www.craftown.com/halloween/craft33.htm for a design pattern. Raffia comes from leaves from a palm tree a species native to Madagascar but also grown in other countries now. The leaves are very fibrous. This 50g hank of Raffia from Gardman seems to be a good handy size for garden use and small art projects, Would I recommend?

       " '5247778::::Britains Large White Pigs::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.07.2010::::    Come and play with me and the toy farm. Today on the farm I have the Britains 40000966 (model code) Large White Pigs. This set of model pig toys is suitable for an over 5 year old so if you are over five do come and play. This pack of pigs includes two large white pigs with four piglets. These pigs are all standing in slightly different positions. The adult pigs are a very paler pink colour the piglets a darker colour. These pigs are made of plastic. The modelling is very detailed from ears right down to curly pig tail. These pigs are about 2.5cm tall they are a good size for playing farms with or for using on a model set. A lot of model sets are 1:32 if you are a toy steam train model maker these would look fine in the fields around an OO gauge railway set. This animal being made of plastic with no moving parts last well. They are easy to clean just wash in soap and water. I love farm play with the children. Play is a child s work these pigs would be good to use while exploring the curriculum foundation stage or key stage 1. While playing you can introduce the names of Animals and the names of animal young. Pigs are ideal for extending the topic of homes a pigs home is a sty. Looking at these pigs you can talk about how many legs they have look and count their eyes ears nose mouth. You could use these pigs as a visual prop for the three little pig s story. Your child can pretend top feed the pigs; we have a small toy plastic bucket. The children enjoy putting the large white pigs into fields or in the toy sty, while playing with these pigs the children often make pig noises  quot;oink, oink quot;. The children I watch play with these put them in trucks to take to market or just move them to a different field These pigs are durable will last years and years, all you might need to do is wash them that are all. Would I recommend? Yes This pack of 6 large white pigs cost    4 at http://www.amazon.co.uk this is with free delivery a lot of other model /toy shops on line are also selling for around this price but most have delivery charges which add to the price. I expect you could buy these pigs in the high street toy or model shop for around this price too      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5719918:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6701923:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6474927:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6834688:4:::6739162:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6845273:4:::6845273:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6378505:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6800944:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6785596:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Calypso Scooby-Doo Freezepops::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::01.07.2010::::    I rarely go into Asda shopping we do not have one locally, but the other day I was there and bought a box of 40 Scooby Doo freeze pops there are actually 50- in the packet I bought as there was a special offer. This box of freeze pops only cost me    1 so for 2p a pop I thought that good value. I note on my supermarket that although Tesco do not sell these 20ml freezer pops that they do a larger 50ml freezer pop in a box of 20 for    1.09 I bought these to freeze for summer treats for the grandchildren when they come to visit. Scooby doo freeze pops come in a card box with a picture of Scooby and nutritional info. These Scooby Doo freeze pops are made by Calypso who have been making soft drinks for many years. I opened the box and took a handfull of freezer pops out and put in the freezer to freeze. These freezer pops are sold unfrozen 20 g of flavoured water is enclosed in a clear plastic strip, this has the name Scooby do and a picture of himself on it. The strip measures 15cm. These Scooby Doo freeze pops took a couple of hours to freeze solid. The Scooby Doo freeze pops come in 5 flavours - Lemonade, Strawberry, Blackcurrant, Orange and Cola flavour. Each one the colour of those products. When frozen I offered one to my grandchildren and had one myself. To get into these freezer pops you have to cut open the end, I have in the past bitten into the [plastic end then ripped it open. I had the orange one the flavour was not a strong one it was light and pleasant. There was not much to this freezer pop the size I thought fine for the children. These Freezer pops are made with natural flavours and colours. They are made with sugar and sweeteners the sweetener is Acesulfame k check the box or http://www.calypso.co.uk/product-detail.php?iRange Id=44 if you want to know what additives are used There are only 6 kcal per 20ml ice pop. My grandchildren enjoyed these .The size was fine for them aged 7 and 4 years old. I do not expect to buy any more Scooby doo ice pops this year as these should be enough for their visits.      ::::6701923:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5439461:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6843355:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5719918:4:::6843124:4:::6843124:4:::6800944:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6833802:4:::6833802:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::3957:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6805797:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6474927:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Cheslyn House and Gardens, Watford::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::30.06.2010::::    We were entertaining some friends and their son who is leaving school soon and wants to go into horticulture so we planned a visit at the Eden gardens then a visit to Cheslyn House and Gardens. Cheslyn gardens were on the back to our home we had nacre visited before but when trawling the internet for places to visit I came across it at http://www.watford.gov.uk Cheslyn house and gardens are at 54 Nascot Wood Road, Watford, Hertfordshire, WD17 4SL, UK this is justOff the A411 Hempstead Road, near M25 and A41. Bus W14 stops outside the gate. We had 2 cars and did find a small amount of parking in a small side entrance but only enough space for one car the other car parked in a side street just a bit further on. Entrance to the gardens is free. The house is let to events of a horticultural nature not parties or weddings. The ground floor offers 2 lecture rooms, kitchen and toilet facilities. We did not go into the house. The gardens are open all the year except Christmas and Boxing Day. Times of opening are April to September 9 is till 8pm October 9are till 6pm November to February 9am till 4pm and March 9am till 6pm. It was a sunny afternoon when we visited and I think the grounds would be suitable for a small summer wedding party however it is not available for that. This garden is a really good green space asset to Watford a haven to walk around. The gardens are not huge but are quite large at 1.41 hectares (3.5 acres). If you enter at the front of the house on Nascott wood road the front is an open formal garden with lawn and flower beds, this area is wheelchair accessible. At the front of the house there is a trained wisteria with lilac flowers in the summer. There is an Acer in the centre of the lawn. Behind this is a more natural garden, with a pond, rock gardens and a semi-natural woodland area this has narrow paths which the plants overhang. I think I would manage to push a pushchair along most of the paths a full sized wheel chair would probably have a few problems; there were tree roots and uneven ground. There is a small aviary with budgerigars, quail, assorted finches and other varieties of small birds. There are frogs and newts in the pond. Apparently the woodland area has many bulbs in it daffodils snowdrops and bluebells. I notices Rhododendrons amongst the trees although these are showy bright I am sorry I really am not keen on them. There is a tulip tree and an Indian bean tree amongst native species of tree in this woodland area. Along the paths are a few benches dotted about we stopped at one to eat some biscuits and have a drink of water that we had with us. The original owners of this house traveled a lot and the garden has many exotic plants in it. Apparently the woodland area has many bulbs in it daffodils snowdrops and bluebells. I notices Rhododendrons amongst the trees although these are showy bright I am sorry I really am not keen on them. There is a tulip tree and an Indian bean tree amongst native species of tree. As well as various bird species squirrels, foxes, badgers and the occasional Muntjac deer have been seen. I suppose we were there for about 50 minutes. I noted on the website http://www.watford.gov.uk/ there was info about a free-guided-walk- last year its possible there may be others this year. If you wanted a quiet space for a green walk yes I would recommend these gardens .The plants were interesting it was a peacefull qiet place we notices only 3 other people walking around while we were there.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5719918:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::6844626:4:::6844626:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5816422:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::6836570:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6837147:4:::6837147:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6474927:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6750576:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::3957:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Thompson & Morgan Scarlet Emperor Runner Bean::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::28.06.2010::::    My Thomson and Morgan Scarlet Emperor runner beans are gaily twining themselves up the garden canes in the vegetable garden. In the paper envelope there were about 50 seeds. I bought mine from a garden centre but I note on line the price is    2.99 from http://www.nextday-seeds.co.ukml I started mine of in pots in the greenhouse in late April. I grew mine in peat free compost. I duly watered them and watched them grow until they were a reasonable size to transplant after the frosts in the end of May. My beans were a few cms tall and had several real leaves. I grow mine indoors to give them a good start also because I get a lot of snails and slugs who love top eat the tender shoots. You can grow these beans from seed straight in the garden mid May to mid June, so if you are inspired just in time this week to grow from seed. The seeds need to be about 15cm apart about 5cm deep. I planted my runner beans out around the canes that I had arranged in a wigwam shape. I shall be watching my Bean s grow to about 2 metres high and producing red flowers. Scarlet emperor requires bees to pollinate them so that beans will be formed. I think that the runner bean climbing up a wigwam covered in red flowers are attractive, so do some butterflies too. The Brimstone butterfly will feed on the nectar from the flower, I am not sure about other butterflies but if you notice any please let me know. I have had no need to water my beans as yet as it has been wet and rainy, Runner beans do need to be kept damp and watered regularly especially when the pods have started to form. These beans should crop in about 90 days after sowing the seeds. so by the end of July beginning of August I should be eating fresh beans from the garden. To keep then scarlet emperor beans forming make sure you pick all the old beans. That s no problem here as we love runner beans to eat. The pods of this bean should grow about 12-15in/ 30cm-37cm long. These beans are delicious cooked. They do not have a strong favour. Just boil in water for about 10 minutes do not over cook or they lose all their vitamins , do not eat raw else they will upset your tummy. Runner beans are great withy hot meats and potatoes. They go especially well with bacon I do notice a few more interesting recipes with runner beans at http://www.cookitsimply.com/category-0020-024m3.ht ml. I just had a strong memory from the 1960 s before freezers were commonplace in the home. I see my mum and grandma slicing beans and putting them in a crock pot layering them with salt to keep for winter use. . I looked on line and found info on how to do this if you wish its http://www.taste-of-home-recipes.com /chutney-and-pickles/salted-runner-beans.html. Beans are good for the soil to as the beans fix nitrogen on their roots which improves soil fertility. Runner beans are a native of central and northern South America, The bean was introduced to Spain Following Columbus s second voyage to the New World in1493. I believe the bean did not arrive in England till the mid 1600 s at the earliest and eventually with breeding the varieties of beans including the Scarlet Emperor are what we know today Runner beans are a good source of Vitamin C, folate, iron and have high fibre content. So they are good for you. John Morgan. And William Thompson founded their company selling seeds and plants more than 150- years ago now. Thompson and Morgan seeds are reliable and germinate well. I would recommend these Scarlet emperor beans from this seeds merchant. I leave you with a question Which bean will win the race, gt;? Answer in comments. Oh I forgot to say , ideal for growing with children , great for a prop for illusttrating Jack and the beanstalk story.      ::::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6704805:4:::6704805:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5577439:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6800944:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6657747:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6739162:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6830048:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::3957:4:::6474927:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6789555:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

We went on several long walks and there was an abundance of thyme plants and fennel. Fennel tastes of liquorice a malt flavour. I can just remember the green countryside with its herbs and the sound of bees buzzing and humming collecting nectar to make this wonderful tasting honey.

Stabilo highlighters are available in several sizes. The one I use is the standard original one. This is a flat pen the plastic case of the pen is the same colour as the ink it writes. This pen is 3cm wide, 1cm thick it is easy to hold and use. They all have black plastic caps. Just twist the cap and it will come of easily. Replace the cap after use and this will stop the pen from drying out The nibs are chisel tipped and the line they produce 5mm wide. They will also produce a finer line if you write with its chisel point. These pens make a good bright mark for highlighting pertinent points in your work. These pens are odourless and the ink water based.  If you should get some on your skin it will easily wash off.

       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Tap A Shape::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::25.06.2010::::    I was looking on the ELC website and discovered they still sell this tap a shape toy. This toy has been available for several years. I have used it, given it to children to play with many times. http://www.elc.co.uk is selling it for    8. http://www.amazon.co.uk has this toy for    5.99 This set includes a rectangular cork board about 25cm long and about 2o cm wide. With this board comes lots of little wooden shapes I would think getting on for 100, There are triangles , rectangles squares circles, semi circles These shapes are all different bright primary colours . In the centre of each shape is a little hole drilled in, This is to put a little metal tack in, lots of little flat headed metal tacks are included in this set . There are two little hammers with the set. This Tap a shape is suitable for a 4 to about 8 year old, no younger than that because of the tacks and the small pieces. I have myself and have seen children make many designs with these coloured shapes , some designs abstract but it is possible to make a girl or a boy design using circles , rectangles squares and a triangle makes a good girls skirt. A car can be made or a flower. All it need is your child to work out which shapes to use. This is a good educational toy. It promotes fine motor skills and visual perception. Is good for familiarization with shapes, colours and their names. It will depend on your child s abilities the amount of supervision that they will require while playing with this, but do remember to praise your child for their work, talk to them about the shapes      ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6701923:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::5816422:3:::6785596:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5735532:3:::5735532:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6750576:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6800944:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6474927:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6751010:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Peppa Pig Colour and Draw Activity Book - Ladybird::::Books::::30::::very helpful::::24.06.2010::::    My granddaughter aged 4 loves Peppa pig, so when I noticed that the book people had a selection of 8 Peppa Pig Activity books on sale in the staff room I bought a pack for her. One of the books included in this set was the Colour and draw book. The complete set cost me    7.99, I noticed on the back of the book it says    3.99 and looking on line I notice http://www.petitesouris.co.uk is selling this single book for that price. This book and the others from this selection are suitable for a 3-5 year old. I have kept this book at my house so it is ready for my granddaughter to colour and draw when she visits. This book has a blue cover with a picture of Peppa Pig smiling on it. There are 16 pages to this book the first page a title page then 15 activity pages 15 of them. There are a couple of double page activities but most are single page activities. . At the top of each page there are written instructions like,  quot;Silly daddy pig is in the pond with the ducks use your brightest pencils to colour in this picture quot; The words are clearly printed in black. A child who is beginning to read may be able to read some of these words. Some of the pages have simple colouring in pictures, others have activities like dot to dots these have no numbers. The picture and the positioning of the dots makes it obvious where to join. I notice my granddaughter has done all those dot to dot pages first, all on her own too. Then there are pages where your child has to draw their own picture. for example one page you have to draw what you think is in Georges birthday present. The surrounds and pictures in this book are good bright colours simple pictures; the paper is good quality too, not like some cheap colouring in books. My granddaughter has had fun doing this book. I think it is a good idea to get a character activity book like this to encourage childrens pencil skills. IO thinks this book would be an ideal book to take on holiday or a visit to relatives to provide something to keep your child amused. I think as past of the 8 books for    7.99 I got from the book people this was a fair price. However I do not think I would pay    3.99 for this activity book on its own. I discover that you can download and print Peppa pig pictures for colouring and dot to dots at http://www.coloring.ws or at http://www.coloring-book , I suspect there are other sites doing this too.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6800944:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6842893:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6841465:4:::6841465:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6701923:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6750576:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6751010:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6814341:4:::6814341:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6789555:4:::6755322:4:::5816422:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5670298:4:::5670298:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6474927:4:::6378505:4:::5790028:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sun Grown Peach Juice Drink::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::23.06.2010::::    I was in Tesco the other week and stocked up on juice drinks. I decided to pop an unknown into the basket a sun grown peach juice this is a discount brand and cost 80p for a litre box. The shelf life date on this carton is good. If I kept it unopened the box I bought would be fine till Feb 2011, once open keep refrigerated and use within 3 days. Yesterday feeling hot and dehydrated I got the peachy orange coloured box with pictures of a peach on it from my fridge (I had put it in there to cool it) I opened the twist cap broke the silver foil seal and poured into a long cool glass. Trickle, trickle, trickle the thick amber colour juice poured into my glass. This is not a clear liquid you can not see through it. I raise the glass to my lips and as I do so my nose smells sweet peaches. Glug, glug glug I drink. This juice drink is quite thick and syrupy, its not really refreshing .I feel like I am drinking the syrup from a can of peaches. The taste is really oversweet it has that furry peach taste texture, it does not taste like fresh peach very much it tastes more like a cheap tinned peach its quite a strong yet artificial flavour I thought. Although I did drink all my juice, I did not find it something I will search out again in the future. This carton says it is a peach juice drink, containing 45  peach puree, peach juice and lemon juice from concentrate. Although it is nut free there is a get out of jail clause that says they can not guarantee nut free. Calories 60 kcal per 100 ml so a serving of 250ml is 140kcal Would I recommend? Yes if you like sweet tinned peaches made into juice, personally my thirst were not quenched I also had a drink of water after as I was still thirsty and my mouth felt cladded by that furry peach juice      ::::3338:3:::3338:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6816400:3:::6816400:3:::5816422:3:::6820455:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5439461:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6506577:4:::5335750:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6739162:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6474927:4:::6688167:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6800944:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6757811:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6805797:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6378505:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Jingle Bells::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::22.06.2010::::    ELC jingle bells http://www.elc.co.uk/toy/jingle-bells-1/ I know its not Christmas but when I was looking at the ELC pages for a gift for a friend   s child I noticed the jingle bells. I have used these bells with children in my care and thought I would tell you all about them. These bells come in a pack of three and only cost    3.00 so an inexpensive early musical instrument really.These bells are suitable for a child aged over 3 years old. I think this is because the bells themselves are quite small and although fairly firmly fixed to the plastic handle a child under 3 would most likely put them in their mouth and potentially swallow them.Each of these 3 bell instruments has a shaped plastic handle which is a good size for a 3 or 4 year old to grasp it is a smooth coloured plastic one of the handles is red one blue, one green. One end of this is widened and three metal bells are securely attached to each handle. I have used these bells with special needs children with poor grip by letting them grip the bells in their hands and then wrapping my hand around their hand assisting them to shake the bells.When shaken these bells will ring out fairly quietly, making a good sound to add to the Christmas songs or any other song that require bells. It is not a sound that will drown out singing or other instruments. These bells are really quite a simple toy/musical instrument. Children love to use them and make a ringing sound. Bells like this are educational they will encourage a child   s gross motor control. They will enhance a musical experience. These bells could be used to gain a child   s attention and   turn their head or eye point to where the sound is coming from. These balls should last quite a long time they are well made; I would certainly recommend them for 3. 4, 5 year olds possibly even 6 or 7 year olds too. These bells are ideal for both home and early year   s settings. They are a good accompaniment to many childrens songs as well as Christmas carols. Have fun ringing these bells .They are available at Early learning centre shops or on line at http://www.elc.co.uk/toy/jingle-bells-1/     ::::6723241:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::3957:4:::6688167:4:::6826744:4:::6826744:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6836079:4:::6836079:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6842893:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6735325:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6805797:4:::6842363:4:::6842363:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6789555:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6834688:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6161720:4:::6161720:4:::6378505:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5790028:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

We stopped at a petrol station for petrol and I went into their mini shop and bought ice creams. The ice cream that I had was a Magnum mint. This chocolate covered ice cream on a stick cost me    1.25. The weight 110mls about 80g. Magnum is sold under the Walls brand name, Walls is I believe one of Unilevers brands. In 1989 the original Magnum, Magnum Classic was first produced this mint one is as recent addition becoming available in 2007. I took the dark chocolate coloured and green wrapper of my ice cream. The outside of the ice-cream lolly was completely covered in chocolate; this chocolate had a sprinkling of crispy sugar strands in it. I bit some of the chocolate off first as I have known the chocolate on these covered ice cream lollies to break and fall off. I had my hand ready to catch any falling chocolate but only a few small pieces cracked and fell of into my hand. The chocolate was a good tasting chocolate. I bit into the ice cream it was soft (it was a hot sunny day) and the white ice-cream was mint flavored I immediately said tom y husband this is like eating a frozen after eight. The mint flavour was quite strong. I enjoyed eating my minty and chocolate ice cream I ate it fairly fast as it was melting in the sun. Did I enjoy this? Yes Will I buy one again? I might do if wanting a mint flavoured chocolate ice cream lolly but it was a bit sweet and minty Of course there are lots of calories in this ice cream I think its 300kcal      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5719918:3:::5735532:3:::5735532:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5690767:3:::6840624:3:::6840624:3:::6785596:3:::3957:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5817960:3:::5817960:3:::6836079:3:::6836079:3:::6701923:3:::6431958:3:::6431958:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5351312:3:::5351312:3:::6739162:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6419938:3:::6419938:3:::6717480:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5646482:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5306962:3:::5306962:3:::5439461:3:::5816422:3:::6842370:3:::6725337:3:::6725337:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6800944:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5805376:4:::6562051:4:::6562051:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

I seem to remember they cost me about    1.50 each. Nemesia a member of the Family SCROPHULARIACEAE is a half-hardy annual from South Africa. There are several different types of Nemesia plants, mine is one of the Nemesia strumosa Paint box this type has several different coloured flowering  plants. These   have dual coloured flowers mine is a flower that is two shades of lilac, other plants might be   yellow, blue red or purple.  This plant will grow to about 30cm (12 quot;). Spread: 15cm (6 quot;). . The flowers themselves are quite small about a centimeter. They look a bit like a snap dragon. My little plant has developed to be a little bush like plant with lots of flowers on it. This nemesia will flower till the end of the summer giving me lots of colour.. Living in the Chilterns I have very chalky soil and after about a month of being planted my nemesias look healthy. They like a well drained soil and   only watering once a week so my soil must suit them. It is possible to grow these plants from seed in the greenhouse in April or in the garden after the frosts. I have heard these plants do not like frosts. I also read that you can take cuttings; keeping them in the greenhouse I might try that later this year. Also I read that if you let these flowers seed they will self set this will be ideal I shall certainly let my flowers seed in the garden. I think these plants look very pretty they would suit a pot or tub in the garden as well as suited to the border     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6391230:3:::6391230:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6836599:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5690767:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::3957:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6840580:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6378505:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6243305:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I started my seeds of in the greenhouse and planted them out a couple of weeks ago. You can sow the seed straight in the garden, but I prefer not too. This Suttons summer broccoli is a broccoli that matures quite quickly other broccolis takes a lot longer. Anyway a couple of weeks ago I transplanted the tiny seedlings about 7cm tall in a lovely straight row. I then watered them. The next day when I went to water again I found that most of them were laying on the soil surface roots exposed as if someone had pulled them out. I replanted them not expecting much success as they were very dry. Going into the kitchen looking out of my window as I did the washing up what did I see? **** BLOOMING BIRDS pecking around them and pulling them out of the ground, mutter, mutter, mutters. I replanted and put some more plants in that I had. Sad to say most of these got either slugged or pulled out again. I have now reseeded although it s a little late as the Suttons seed packet contains 360 seeds more than enough. These broccoli mature in about 12 to 16 weeks. Broccoli is a really healthy vegetable a member of the brassica family. Broccoli is full of vitamin A and C. there is new evidence that suggests that broccoli may offer some protection against cancer. The purple shoots that appear are really tasty if picked young I also use the green broccoli leaves. Hopefully if I can beat the birds and slugs I will be able to pick broccoli shoots from a plant for quite a while as picking the broccoli shoots encourages more growth, the shoots mature at different times. I like the taste of broccoli, giving a child broccoli maybe the way to introduce them to cabbage as  quot;the little flowers are pretty quot; These seeds RRP IS    1.9 9 bought mine at a local garden centre I note that http://www.capitalgardens.co.uk are selling them for    1.49 free mainland UK delivery      ::::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::6701923:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5719974:4:::6840580:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5598433:4:::5598433:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6739162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5816422:4:::6800944:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6657747:4:::6378505:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6506577:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::5203100:4:::6820455:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Morrisons Value Tinned Tomatoes::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.06.2010::::    I usually shop at Tesco   s its more convenient but sometimes I shop at Morrison   s. One of my store cupboard stables is a tin of   tomatoes .I usually buy the value ones. I bought a tin of Morrison   s value chopped tomatoes which I used recently. This tin of Morrison   s value tomatoes costs 35p for a 400g tin. This tin contains 240g when drained, doesn   t bother me as I use the juice in cooking anyway. This tin is labelled simply and uninspiring. It   s easy to open with a tin opener, recycle the tin when you dispose of it the bin men collect tins and glass separately to household rubbish.Pouring these tomatoes out to make my spag boll they are red (what a surprise). These tomatoes are ready chopped (my guess they used the tomatoes which are not in prime condition) Looking at the tomatoes I do notice an occasional stem. These tomatoes look fine much like any other chopped tinned tomatoes in juice. The smell is tomatoes these tomatoes have that sweet tomato taste they have not lost much flavour in the canning process. So added to my mince onions, garlic, marjoram they make a great Bolognese sauce and keeps the price down. I use tinned tomatoes to add to a beef stew or to make a soup. They are ideal for adding to a veggie bean recipe.These tomatoes taste as good as expensive ones in my spg boll sauce. The tin only contains Tomatoes, tomato juice and citric acid.  There are 16, calories per 100g so ideal for a dieter. Will I buy and use these again? Yes unless I buy the Tesco tin of value tomatoes at 33p.     ::::5790028:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6723241:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::6752066:3:::6752066:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5439461:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6609678:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5335750:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6785596:4:::6506577:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6688167:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6474927:4:::6243305:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Assorted Washproof Plasters::::Health::::30::::very helpful::::17.06.2010::::    Ouch Nana I scratched my arm, there, there dear let Nana look. Now let   s just give it a little wash and put a plaster on it. There now that will make it better and stop the germs getting in. Now give me a hug and off you go and play. I recently needed some new plasters as the above is a scenario that has frequently happened at my house. I bought a pack of 40 assorted wash proof plasters from Tesco they cost me   1.17 any 2 FOR    2.00     Valid until: 12/12/2010. These plasters come in a card box which is green and white this has pictures of the plasters on it and some information giving instructions for use.  It gives allergy advice    These plasters feature a hypoallergenic, latex free adhesive to minimise the risk of an allergic reaction. A pack of assorted plasters is good as you do get a variety of sizes. There are 4 plasters sized 25x 76 mm there are 6 sizes 38x38 mm there are 12 sized 19x38 mm there are 18 19x72mm. All of these plasters are individually wrapped this stops infection germs getting on to them. The white paper that each plaster is enclosed in has some blue lines in to indicate where to tear to get to the plaster. Now I don   t know about anyone else but I do still find it difficult sometimes to get the plaster out of this outer wrapping. These plasters are pink plasters. Each plaster has a 2 pieces of grease proof paper that is stuck to the sticky part of the plaster. This is easy to remove as in the centre of the plaster where they join there is an over lap which is easy to grasp. Remove these pieces of paper and you will see a lint antiseptic pad to help prevent infection in the centre. The plaster sticks well to dry skin with the sticky wash proof fabric . The plaster is smooth and comfortable to wear it does make a good seal to prevent infection getting in. The plaster does not come of easily when it is worn, but when you wish to remove the plaster then just pick at the edges and it can be peeled off. . I have worn one of these plasters for a few days without it peeling off. (Mind you most children will pick at plasters and remove them) Now are these plasters really wash proof? Well I think so, to a degree. I have washed and got wet areas protected by these plasters and as long as they are not rubbed or dried with a towel roughly they are fine.  They will stay on the skin whilst showering. I have found that although they will mostly stay on when I go swimming they will peel of it  when you get out after a long time. So yes I am happy to use these on my own or on grandchildren   s cuts and scratches.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6842866:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6836570:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6688167:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::3957:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5690767:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6701923:4:::5598433:4:::5598433:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6833727:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6145850:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6834688:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6710719:4:::5816422:4:::6474927:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5790028:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6378505:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6820455:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I spread some of this on my scone and tasted, it was delicious. This jam , conserves a name for posh jam comes in a glass jar with a metal screw top lid this lid has a red gingham check giving the conserve a country look . There are 370g of conserve in this jar. This conserve is a very dark red colour. Its flavour a lovely morello cherry flavour. This jam quite sweet but full of flavour Bonne Maman use 50g black cherries per 100g which is the quantities my mother used to use when jam making. The ingredients are Black Cherries, Sugar, Cane Sugar, Gelling Agent (Fruit Pectin), Citric Acid (mum would use lemon juice for the citric acid content mum said lemon juice helped jam set). You know this Bonne Maman jam could easily be one my mum used to make it has that same home made taste. This jam is a gorgeous dark red colour and it has some large pieces of cherry in it these are juicy and succulent, no cherry stones of course. Some people, children especially might not like as its got  quot;bits in it quot;, these bits the large real fruit pieces are what make this jam superb. Of course June is the cherry picking season so it feels right to be eating cherry conserve now. Eating my scone with cherry jam I sit and imagine myself in the warm countryside that was so nice I am going to have another. Not too much jam though as it contains 261 kcal per 100g. No fat though just lots of sugar. Bonne Maman is a French company but thier jam widely available in England. I bought mine from Tesco s where it costs    2.19 2 FOR    3.20 - Valid until: 22/06/2010.

       " '5247778::::Kings Seeds Lettuce Red Salad Bowl::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::14.06.2010::::    I bought a packet of these Kings Red Salad Bowl Seeds in April at the same time as a packet of the green ones. I bought mine at a local hardware shop. for    1.00  I have noticed these seeds at garden centres too  These seeds come in a white paper packet with pictures of the red lettuce on and information about sowing. The packet easy to open I tore mine open but you may prefer to use scissors or knife.  I sowed some of these seeds in April. There are lots of seeds in the packet, I looked on the Kings website and it says 500, I did not count but quite believe it.  The germination rate of these seeds is good. I folded the top over and paper clipped it then yesterday I sowed some more hoping to have a continuous lettuce summer.  I always start my lettuce seeds of in a seed tray in the green house to give them a good start.   Sow the seeds about 2cm deep with 30cm between rows. These seeds can be sown from March to July so I shall sow a few more at the end of July.  The seeds took just over a week to  appear as tiny seedlings then when they were big enough at about 3 weeks old I planted them in a row  some alternating between the green ones. Since mid to the end of May I have been taking a few leaves from each lettuce plant for my salads. These lettuces are a good tasting crisp leaf. These lettuce look pretty the outside leaf frilly serrated. I like the way they look in the garden with the green  ones. These lettuces are ones which grow new leaves continuously. They will go to seed and taste a little sour after a while that   s why I sow more seeds later.  Kings are a reputable supplier of seeds from Essex they have been active since 1888.

       " '5247778::::Britains Farm Fencing::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.06.2010::::    My granddaughter aged 4 loves to play with the toy farm and accessories that I keep at my house; my grandson aged 7 is not averse to playing with it sometimes too. This set of Britain s fencing is ideal for separating the sheep from the cows. In this pack there are 6 sections of fencing enough for a small field. A pack of 3 fencing panels and an opening gate can also be purchased. The price of the pack of 6 fencing panel s costs    3.79 from http://www.scalefarm.com the fencing with gate costs    3.79 too. You can buy for    4.00 from www.amazon. This farm fencing is suitable for children aged 5. Each fence panel is made of plastic. The fence panel measures approximately 11 x 4 cm. it is 1:32 scale in keeping with the other Britain s farm toys. Each fence panel has two end posts one of the fence post has a flat plastic piece at the bottom with 3 small rectangular holes open on each outer side of the fence post. The other fence post on the same fence panel has no base. The fence posts can be fitted together by inserting bare fence posts base into another fence panel by insetting it into the hole in the base. The fence can be fitted together at 90 and 180 degree angles to make either straight fencing or a corner piece. Once fitted together the fencing is fairly firm. The fence has 3 bars across it from side to side. It s a classic fence. The fencing is a brown so looks like a wood fence. It is a bit fiddly to fit these fenced together but a 5 year old should be able to fit them. This fence does add a bit more play potential to the farm you can fence the animals in or fence the field to keep the animals out. You can use this fencing to see if your child can sort the animals into categories put all of one kind of animal in a field surrounded by fencing. Think that this fencing is a good addition to the farm. This plastic fencing should last a long time, many play hours it s suitable for home or education facility. Yes if you have other farm toys this 1:32 scale I would recommend.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5690767:4:::6758309:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6786865:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6832843:4:::5719974:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6739162:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6830270:4:::6378505:4:::6789555:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6749875:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Melissa and Doug are an American manufacturer of childrens toys who first began in 1988 making toys at their own home.All of the Melissa and Doug toys that I have come across have been excellent. The themes and contents well thought out and they are very durable. This Farm friend   s peg puzzle is one I have come across at my work with special needs children. It is suitable for children of 1.year old and over.This is a thick wooden peg puzzle Dimensions: 1.5 quot; x 12 quot; x 15.5. / 37 x 29 cm The base of the puzzle is farm  building shaped it has a thin  plain wood border  with the trade mark Melissa and Doug written on and the words crafted by hand. The farm building is red with vertical marking to make it look like wooden planks. At the base is a layer of yellow painted on to represent straw.There are 7 animal peg puzzle pieces cut out of this barn they are a horse a sheep, a duck, a cow, a goat, a pig and a hen. These are not all in a line on the bottom of the barn but all over it. There is also a farmer puzzle piece with a peg on it. The animal pieces are all shaped they are rounded cute little animals very attractive they are the entire correct colour for the animal that they represent. The farmer is attractive too he has a blue overall on and wears a straw hat he holds a bucket, I assume the bucket full of water or animal feed.

       " '5247778::::Melisasa & Doug  Wooden Fishbowl Jumbo Knob Puzzle::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::09.06.2010::::    This fishbowl wooden puzzle is another fantastic puzzle from Melissa and Doug. This puzzle is a really thick piece of wood shaped like a fish bowl. It is 1.7 quot; x 12 quot; x 12.5 quot;/4.1 x 29.2 x 30.5 cm. In this wooden fishbowl puzzle three fish shaped pieces are cut out a fish a turtle and a crab. These pieces have huge jumbo knobs on them. These knobs are easy to grasp so the shapes can be removed and replaced in their places. Each of the jigsaw pieces are brightly painted the fish a yellow gold the crab red the turtle a black shell with green head legs and tail. Each has large eyes and a smiling mouth. When removed from their places on the puzzle there is a matching picture underneath. The fish bowl shaped base has a natural wood outline with crafter by hand and Melissa and Doug written on it the interior of the bowl shape is painted blue this has a few lighter wavy blue lines painted across it and there are a few white circles representing bubbles. This is an attractive puzzle and a good one for children over the age of 1 year old. It is easy to manipulate and position the pieces. I have used this puzzle with special needs children and although suitable for a normal 1 year old -2.1/2 year old it really is ideal for older children with poor manipulative, hand control. This puzzle is excellent for practicing eye hand coordination. This puzzle would be good for home use or in the early year s department. You could link this puzzle to a topic about fish or animals have links with the EYFS/early year s foundation stage, the world about us. You could use this puzzle to aid language development talk about the fish count them. I must admit I found it difficult to find on sale on a UK website but discovered you can buy this puzzle from http://dolltv.com for    6.18 the list price is    10.77. I would think it possible to purchase through educational supplier in the UK. Would I recommend? Yes this is a lovely puzzle for a toy it s well made and durable.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5719918:4:::5735532:4:::5735532:4:::6796380:4:::6796380:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::3957:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5335750:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6392537:4:::6392537:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6840867:4:::6840867:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6292077:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6836079:4:::6836079:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6814341:4:::6814341:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5719974:4:::5997493:4:::5997493:4:::6805797:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6739162:4:::6820455:4:::6474927:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::5790028:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5816422:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6378505:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Soft Cheese::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::07.06.2010::::    Wow a 200g tub of soft cheese for 25p, that can t be bad. It is a full fat cheese though 23g per 100g and 245 kcal per 100g. The Tesco extra light one for 92p has 6.0g of fat and only 130kcal per 100. There is also a value soft cheese with garlic and herbs that costs 59p for 200g. Philadelphia cheese cost    1.35 for 200g This Tesco value soft cheese comes in a shallow rectangular tub. The top is a foil like peel back lid. Once you peel the lid back you expose a pale looking cream cheese. This cheese does not smell much. I am going to have some on a water biscuit so I dip my knife into the cheese and spread some all over my cracker. It s thick but easy to spread. I take a bite the taste pleasant it s good mildly cheesy and creamy. This cheese is good in a sandwich or on French bread. I sometimes chop up some chives and parsley and blend into this cheese to add flavour. You could use this cheese in any cooked recipe that requires a soft cheese it is a mild flavour. I do like this soft cheese it is very similar to the Philadelphia one but a lot cheaper. I must admit I do not often buy this preferring less fat and calories. However when I am feeling skint and need a cream cheese this will find itself going home from Tesco s with me This cheese is made with milk has gluten in it contains wheat and is not guaranteed nut free, so beware allergy sufferers     ::::5719918:3:::6796380:3:::6796380:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5816422:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::3957:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6766749:3:::6840624:3:::6840624:3:::5439461:3:::6217853:3:::6217853:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6292077:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6820455:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5592334:4:::5592334:4:::6842050:4:::6814341:4:::6814341:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::5447660:4:::5447660:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6474927:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6378505:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5365485:4:::5365485:4:::6830048:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Britains 40784 - Case MXU125 Tractor::::Family::::40::::helpful::::06.06.2010::::    I seem to have a lot of Farm toys both here for the grandchildren and at work a lot of them are made by Britain s. This red tractor 40784/Case-IH-MXU-125- is one of the Britain s 1:32 model scale size. This size of tractor is great for a model farm scene fits with a Hornby oo gauge railway scene well. This tractor is suitable both as a toy for a child or as a model tractor for a model makers scene it would look well in a farming display. This tractor is a classic red I always think of tractors as being red. It is a die cast metal tractor with some plastic. This tractor has a detachable cab and inside the cab is a steering wheel which works. At the back is a rear hitch mechanism to which farming equipment can be hitched. This tractor is well detailed very realistic. This tractor is a good copy of the real thing only smaller. Although Britain s suggest suitable for 3 and over I think it better for an older child. I don t think it would be a great problem for a 3 year old but I think it better for an older child. This tractor fairly robust and should last years. You can buy this tractor from Amazon for    12.25 or from http://www.myfirstyears.co.uk/prodpage.asp?prodid= 1644 for    13.9.

       " '5247778::::Rowse Pure Natural Blossom Honey Clear::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::05.06.2010::::    I  like honey on my toast for breakfast some mornings. At the moment I have a jar of Rowse clear blossom honey. I imagine this honey is blended from hives all over the world situated near a variety of trees. You will see jars of different kinds of Rowse honeys in supermarkets and corner shops. Rowse is the UK s leading honey company. The honeys Rowse sources are from both the UK and other parts of the world. The Rowse s clear blossom honey that I shall have on my toast this morning is in a 400g glass jar. This honey also available in a 227g jars too. The jar has a green screw top lid with Pure and natural printed on it. A paper label wraps itself around the body of the jar displaying the type of honey it is and telling you a little about the honey. So sit down with me and have a slice of honey on toast. Golden brown toast ready I open the pot easily, I sniff it s a sweet smell. I dip a knife into the honey pot; you might prefer to use a spoon. I twiddle the knife around to collect the honey on my knife. I lift the knife out of the pot honey is very runny it drizzles of the end of the knife. The sun is shining and the honey shines golden. It s like liquid sunshine gold drizzling onto my toast. IO put the knife down onto my toast and spread the honey evenly and easily all over. I take my first bite yes the honey is sweet Honeys do taste different if the nectar collected is from different types of flower. This honey has a light flavour, not woody or reminiscent of an individual flower, it s like the sweetness you get when sucked out of a white dead nettle flower which I used to do as a child. This honey is good used as a tea time spread on bread or scones or used in cookery. Honey is sweeter than sugar. Use honey to marinade meats before you barbeque, use as a glaze for buns and cakes. A honey cake is a delight to eat Honey goes especially well with orange so an orange honey cake is good there are many recipes for food at http://www.goldenblossomhoney.com . Honey is delicious for those summer teas and barbeques. A well as being tasty honey is good for you. A very rich nutrient, vitamin and mineral based natural food source Read www.health-benefits-of-honey.com/ishoneygoodforyou .html formore information about health benefits of this wonder food. Rowse blossom honey cost    2.55 at Tesco s,    2.80 at Sainsbury s this clear blossom honey is one of the cheapest Rowse honeys. Would I recommend? Yes it s a good everyday honey Honey bees have been in decline in the last few years I do not think they have completely isolated the cause yet read http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8467746.stm for info.

Playing games doing puzzles like this will also help your child concentrate and give a sense of achievement when he/she completes the task. It is good to have a set of card with the number up to 20. When your child is only just beginning to count use as few cards as he /she can cope with leaning the lower numbers first then slowly add more numbers as they are able to count and match.  The RRP of this matching number cards from Orchard toys is    7.00 you can buy direct from  http://www.amazon.co.uk for this price without postage I have seen it at several other sites cheaper but when you add postage it works out the same or more money.   Would I recommend? Yes it   s a good set of puzzle number cards suitable for home or school.  Orchard toys reliable make good educational toys.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5719918:4:::5365485:4:::5365485:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5816422:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6814341:4:::6814341:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6739162:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6829986:4:::6829986:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6378505:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6834688:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6017016:4:::6017016:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6474927:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Fox's Chunckie Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::01.06.2010::::     I took advantage of an offer on these biscuits recently but that offer has now gone and the price for a packet of Fox s milk chocolate chunkie biscuits is    1.69 at Asda they are    1. a packet. Fox s chunkie biscuits are available with milk chocolate or plain chocolate chips in them the plain chocolate ones cost can be bought for    1.69 at Tesco or Ocado, not available at Asda or so mysupermarket.com tells me. These biscuits come in a 200g pack this is a dark coloured plastic packet with a picture of a couple of the biscuits on it. The dark chocolate packet has a red stripe across it the milk one a blue stripe across it. Opening the packet I discover the biscuits laid out on a brown plastic tray. I counted the biscuits there were only eight, only eight  but they were massive they were thick cookies. I had a packet of the dark chocolate as I prefer my chocolate dark the biscuits were a dark brown had a cracked crumbly appearance. One side was covered with chocolate and the biscuit itself had chocolate chips in it, real chocolate extravagance, These biscuits tasted good a homely chunky oaty flavour with a good tasting chocolate covering and big chocolate chunks in the biscuit too. These biscuits are satisfying. After one biscuit I felt I had enough. I could have had another one but decided that at 103 kcal per biscuit one was enough. Be warned if you have nut allergies as although no nuts contained in the biscuit they use nut ingredients in the factory where these are made they also contain wheat gluten cow s milk oats and Soya. These biscuits were good and I expect to be tempted again, they will be good to offer guests who are visiting this week.      ::::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6609678:4:::6836278:4:::6836278:4:::5719918:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6748799:4:::6748799:4:::6700902:4:::6700902:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::5203100:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5690767:4:::5816422:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6789555:4:::6829986:4:::6829986:4:::6739162:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6834688:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6834218:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6840580:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6474927:4:::6239059:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

       " '5247778::::Tesco Handwash Magnolia::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::25.05.2010::::    If you were visiting me at the moment and wished to use my downstairs under the stairs cloakroom you would find a bottle of Tesco   s magnolia hand wash waiting by the sink. Before I sat down at the computer I washed my hands with this handwash. There are a lot of liquid hand washes available these days; I counted over 40 different ones on the Tesco website when I just looked. They ranged in price from 38p to    2.20. The Tesco magnolia hand wash costs 60p.  I note on the price comparison website that a similar looking white hand wash from Asda costs 54p. This handwash comes in aa cylindrical creamy coloured bottle with a pump action top.There is minimum info on the bottle, just Tesco magnolia hand wash and a little white flower on the bottle. To get in to this hand wash first turn the pump to break the seal then push the little lever on the top down and it will release a little squirt of white hand wash.  The hand wash is a quite thick and fairly creamy; it is not thin and runny. As you press the lever put you   re other wet hand under the nozzle to catch the soap you do not need too much, just a little squirt will release enough hand wash to wash hands. This hand wash is lightly fragranced, a pleasant smell it does not linger on your hands too long. The smell is clean and fresh suitable for both male and female hands not too girly. The info says that this hand wash contains a moisturiser . I make no comment on this as although my hands do not feel dry after using it neither does they feel luxuriously soft and moisturised. This hand wash is not a liquid soap it is a soap free, pH balanced wash.  I like to have a bottled hand wash by the sink in my smallest room under the stairs it is more convenient and cleaner no soap mess on a soap dish. I think this is a good cheap hand wash for use after doing your business in this little room or for me to use after I have made my hands dirty in the garden         ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6840580:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6739162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5255134:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::6834218:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::6805797:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6702243:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6789555:4:::6292077:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5816422:4:::6701923:4:::6830048:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6657747:4:::5781064:4:::5781064:4:::6834688:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6750576:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6378505:4:::6474927:4:::6710719:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Britains Saddleback Pigs::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.05.2010::::     The grandchildren came yesterday and I got the toy farm out for them to play with. I have had this toy farm and assorted animals for about 7 years now, I have added animals and bits too it over the years. All of the animals coming from my local charity shop when I see them in there.These toy pigs are suitable for children over 3 years oldAll Britain   s farm toys are real replica farm toys this saddleback pig no exception. The scale of this hard plastic pig is 1:32 this is compatible with all other Britain   s farm toys and also Hornby 00 gauge or Brio wooden train sets. We (the children and I) often have the brio train out and we set out and the farm animals in the carpet field around the layout. I was lining up the Britain   s saddleback pigs in the pig sty with my granddaughter and picked up mummy pig to examine. Britain   s make a family of saddleback pigs, male, female pig and 3 piglets.    Both male and female toy pig are about L50mm x H 25mm 2x1 inch the piglets L30 x H15mm.  Both male and female pigs have black heads and neck their rear ends are black too. There is a pink band of colour which goes up the front legs and in a wide band over the pig   s upper back. The name saddle back pig is quite descriptive as it looks like a black pig with a pink saddle on it. Their faces have pig features eyes and a piggy snout and those pointed pigs ears. The tail is short and curls round like a real pig   s tail. I have turned mummy pig over it says Britain   s on her tummy. I know this pig id mummy as she has prominent teats on her chest. Sadly I do not find daddy pig so I can not tell you if you can tell that he is a boy, I seem to remember that you can. In a family of Britain   s pigs 4 piglets are included The baby  saddleback pig toys are all black , maybe their markings come with age on the real pig.  These toy piglets stand in slightly different positions, their heads pointing different ways nearer the ground or more in the air. The little pigs have those cute curly tails too. These saddleback pigs from Britain   s toys really do make a great addition to the farm .Not only do they look realistic but they are well made they will last for many years.  Play with these pigs is educational and fun.  You can talk about the sounds animals make pig noises.  You can talk about where they live; you can use them for counting.  While you are playing with your children and these toys you can extend their language use words like up, down, under, on working with special needs children I am so aware of language development.  Play with your children and their toys, capture those precious moments children grow up so quickly. You could play with these toy pigs before or after a farm visit your children will enjoy remembering their visit while playing with these toys. The British saddle back pig is a cross between a Wessex saddleback and an Essex saddle back pig, these Essex pig a rarer breed. These were cross bred in the mid 1960   s. There are now very few if any pure Essex or Wessex pigs You can buy the toy family of Britain   s saddleback pigs for about    4 in a lot of places http://www.amazon.co.uk has them for    4.00 http://www.toy-choice.co.uk/products/295/ has them for    4.75, http://www.stevenstoymaster.com/acatalog/Britains.html has them for    3.99.  I will look in my local charity shop and might find one pig for 25 or 50p. Would I recommend these Britains toy  saddle back pigs ?

       " '5247778::::Tesco Light Choices Tomato Soup::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::18.05.2010::::     love tomato soup for lunch on a cold winter s day. I often buy this Light choices one from Tesco. There are 400g of soup in this tin. You can spot the tin in the soup aisle it has a pale off white label with some light blue writing and a picture of a bowl of red tomato soup garnished with a sprig of parsley I can rarely find a tin opener in our staff room so I do not take this soup to work as it needs a tin opener for this soup as there is no ring pull. I have opened this tin of soup and I put into a Pyrex type bowl to heat in the microwave for 3 minutes. The soup is a light red colour not as bright red as some other tomato soups, being a light soup this soup is not very creamy but it is not watery either. It is a pleasant tomato taste warming and satisfying for a light lunch. I have shared this tin of soup with husband, but if I wished I could use half and store the other half in a non metallic bowl in the fridge for 2 days. Do read the label for allergy advice but this soup does contain milk and mustard, no nuts but Tesco can not guarantee its nut free. As well as the tomato pur   e this tomato soup also contains Oregano Extract, Cinnamon Extract, Onion Extract, and Garlic Oil which give it a pleasant flavour. Calories there are 44 kcal per 100g so that s 88 per 200g serving, half the tin. However I can rarely eat just a bowl of soup I have to have bread or toast with it so that s extra calories. ~This 400g tin of Tesco s light choices tomato soup will cost 52 p, 21p per 200g serving 88 kcal for 200g serving .~ Heinz weight watchers is in a 295g tin which I think is a better quantity for a single portion it costs 66p a tin and there are 104 kcal per 295 g. 70 per 200g. ~ Heinz cream of tomato is in a 400g tin costs 82p, 41p per 200g serving and has 114 kcal per 200g serving ~If you want a cheaper soup Tesco s value is 17p 8     p per 200g serving and only contains 94 kcal per 200g serving. Would I recommend this soup? Yes I like this and it is a light choice lunch. (As long as I do not eat too much bread. :-)      ::::6702243:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5816422:3:::6740155:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6840624:4:::6840624:4:::6840580:4:::6743447:4:::6743447:4:::6824827:4:::6824827:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6757811:4:::6758309:4:::6145850:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6773030:4:::6773030:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6495932:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6506577:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6789555:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6701923:4:::6805797:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6781956:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6834688:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5790028:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Californian Seedless Raisins::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::16.05.2010::::    I like raisins, I use a lot in baking cakes and biscuits. The raisins that are usually in my store cupboard are Tesco   s Californian raisins. These raisins are available in 500 or 1kg bags.  The bags identical in everything except for size are green with information about raisins on it and a picture of green grapes; you can see the raisins through a see through window in the plastic bag the shape of a bunch of grapes.  If you cut open the top of the bag you can close the open bag with a stick resealable tab this is handy stops the raisins getting all over my food cupboard shelf.The name    Californian raisins    conjure up pictures of grapes laid out in the Californian sun to dry a romantic image. The grapes used for these raisins are red grapes hence the dark red brown colour of them. The green grapes tend to be dried as sultanas. Although not the plumpest juiciest raisins I have ever had they are good, better than some others.  The grapes which are dried for these raisins are seedless ones so you will find no hard pips in the centre.  The name raisin is the French name for grapes.  When they are dried  the French call them raisin sec I have noticed this on packets of raisins That I have bought in  France.A few of these raisins are ideal to send your child to school with as part of their lunch or a playtime snack. About 1 heaped tablespoonful of these count as one of the recommended 5 portions of fruit a day. There are 265kcal per 100g of which 0.5 is fat. 64g sugar If you are dieting eat only a few is you snack on them. These French raisins from Tesco are the same ones that Tesco pout in those little red boxes. I have bought the red boxes of raisins for snacks for children and when empty refilled them.  Raisins are good nutritionally, a source of iron, potassium and selenium and contain vitamin A and some vitamin B also rich in fibre.  Anyway to help me write this review I am snacking on some as I write.First looks, well oval brown and wrinkled a bit like rabbit droppings, currants are more like rabbit droppings but these would be a good alternative.Smell not much smells slightly fruity and sweet.Texture skin which is easy to bite through and soft interior you have to chew them a little.Taste light, fruity; sweet these really do make a good alternative to a packet of sweets.They are actually very sweet so I only need a few for a sweet kick. The main reason why I buy raisins is not for snacking but for baking. I make fruit cakes , fruit shortcake biscuits, I put raisins and a little brown sugar into the centre of a cooking apple and bake , I use raisins to make eyes and buttons for ginger bread men, they are great for making faces on many biscuits . I will sometimes add a few raisins to my apple pies or crumbles.A few of these raisins are ideal to send your child to school with as part of their lunch or a playtime snack.

Raisins good nutritionally, a good source of iron, potassium and selenium and contain vitamin A and some vitamin B also rich in fibre. There are so many recipes for raisin   baking that I will not attempt to put one here. Since raisins are dried grapes for some recipies I rehydrate and plump them by soaking in liquid. For a celebration cake or pudding I might use Brandy the raisins will absorb the brandy and make a cake taste delicious.  I might plump my raisins in orange juice for some desserts this makes them very tasty, or I might just use water to get a big fat raisin in my bread.  Would I recommend these raisins? Yes I find them good and use those most often.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Barbarian Catapult 4438::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.03.2010::::    I can   t believe it Playmobil seems to have stopped producing the barbarians catapult. It   s only about 3 years since I bought this toy for my grandson to attack or defend his Playmobil castle. I have found it on sale at a couple of sites. This toy cost  17.96 at http://www.reallygreattoys.com or Amazon has a used one for    20 there are possibly a few places around with one or two but I could not easily find them  Anyway when my grandson was bought his castle some knights and dragons were bought and we thought it just had to have a catapult to fire rocks at the wall or the marauding bad knights. This set harbours the Barbarian attack troop with the catapult. There are I think 13 or 14 pieces in this set. There is the catapult, a wall, 3 barbarian knights, 2 swords two shields, a mace /flail, some stone shots.The barbarian troops are standard playmobile figures with movable arms and claw like grip hands, legs which move together a head that turns.  Each has a different hat and has different uniforms in grey and blue.  The shields are slightly different too one round one shield shaped. The barbarians hold these in their hands a weapon is in the other hand, these barbarians look as if they mean business My grandsons castle remains set up in his bedroom. The barbarian catapult at the ready to attack the rocks read in a plastic trough. So Grandson loads the  catapult  which I think is a trebuchet  This has like a spoon shaped bucket  at one end and a weight at the other . Grandson then puts the weight on and fire  The rock flies into the air and carries about 8 inches the harder the weight put on the further the shot travels. It is quite a forceful stone it knocks over my playmobile knight, boo hoo. It really is strange how little boys inparticular love the weapons in the castle love firing the catapult. My grandson and his friends have fun with the catapult  I do not think it will be ever so long lasting my grandson not very rough but I can see it would fall apart if her were rougher . Although I am not keen on giving children pretend weapons tom play with this catapult is in fitting with the castle and that time in history.  Would I recommend? Well it does add more imaginary play opportunities to the castle and other knight themed toys my grandson has. He learns a bit of medieval history with it.       ::::6701923:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5335750:4:::6802070:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::5816422:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6824143:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::21963:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6784650:4:::6784650:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6824727:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6820455:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lanka Kade Butterfly Spinning Top ST32::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.04.2010::::     Fancy a spin?Then this little toy from Lanka kade might just be the one for you.  This spinning top toy is suitable for children over 3 years old. I think it might be better for a slightly older child than 3.This is a small spinning top, one I have played with recently. I mean small this toy measures 53mm diameter and 62mm high.  This spinning top is a Rubberwood disk with a short pointed piece of wood in the centre of the lower face of the disk; this is what the disc spins on. There is a short wooden knob on the top face which you grasp and twist/spin to make the top spin. The rubber wood disk is painted pink. On it is painted a butterfly with a black body and antennae. The butterfly has blue edges to its red wings and a black spot in each wing. This is quite an attractive item. Now to spin twist and spin the top with thumb and finger and the butterfly will twirl around   . Its good to get it going really fast then you can not at first see it   s a butterfly till the spinning slows down and eventually stops . Spinning a top is fascinating. It   s a good activity for children to help them with   finger movements This toy will not hold the attention for very long really a few spins and that will be enough unless you are a compulsive spinner of course I have known children who will try and spin anything  mad keep doing it obsessively .This spinning butterfly only costs    1.29p from http://www.bearlythere.co.uk it costs    1.99 from http://www.littlebutterfly.org.uk. You can buy the same spinning top but with different pictures on for example a cat, a fairy, a cow and many more. I think these are ideal for stocking filler or to put in a party bag. Lanka Kade makes these spinners they are a shop in Sri Lanka, established in 1994 the toys are designed in England.  Would I recommend? Yes Lanka Kade is a member of the British Assosiation of fair trade shops. For these spinners rubber wood is used from rubber trees that have yielded all their rubber and are felled for new planting     ::::5335750:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6739162:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5816422:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6736605:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::21963:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6474927:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6809614:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The Tesco beans are 29p a tin. There are 420 g in each tin. This Morrison   s tin has a yellow label on it with the green words Morrison   s value written on it. So one night I removed the baked beans from my store cupboard and opened them with my trusty tin opener. No easy ring pull on the value can however it was easy with my tin opener. These smelt pretty much like you expect a baked bean in tomato sauce to smell like. I spooned them into a microwave bowl easy. I was pleased to see the sauce not very thin and there did not seem to be just anew baked beans swimming in large quantity of sauce some cheap brands have fewer beans swimming g in more sauce I expect they sauce cheaper than beans. I cooked these beans in the microwave convenient and easier to wash a Pyrex bowl rather than a metal saucepan.I served these Beans with an egg and chips.These beans were a god texture they did not fall apart and were not as hard as bullets. No different to most other baked beans really. Now to taste    . These beans tasted good The sauces a slightly sweet tomato sauce a pleasant flavour in fact I think the flavour better than the Tesco value ones.

       " '5247778::::Bernard Matthews Mini Kievs::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::11.05.2010::::    Turkey balls stuffed with garlic butter. Yesterday I bought two bags of Bernard Mathew   s mini Kiev   s. We were going to a party where everyone was contributing some food items for the buffet. I bought these for    1 each bag, they were on offer usually retail for    1.35.      These mini Kiev   s were in the freezer section, I did not need to put them immediately in my freezer at home as I had decided to cook them as soon as I got home in preparation to take to the party that evening. I opened the green bag and poured the Kiev   s onto a baking tray. These little Kiev   s were little balls about 2 cm in diameter. They were golden brown in colour this is because the turkey was coated a thin layer of batter covered in breadcrumbs. I pit them into my oven at 200C and cooked for about 16 minutes. I could have cooked them under the grill for 10 minutes but decided to use the oven in case I burn   s them. (Full cooking instructions are on the pack.) When I removed them from the oven they were a lovely colour. Some of the Kiev   s had burst open a little with the cheese and herb sauce oozing out of them. These Smelt good as I placed them on a cooling tray. At this stage they were very, very hot.  We were going to eat them cold at the buffet but they can be eaten hot with potato / chips and vegetables/salad.  In each packet weighing 272g there are 12 mini keeves I think that 6 would be about right for a portion.  I put my cold Kiev   s onto a serving plate and delivered them to the part along with the other nibbles that I had prepared. I did have one of these Kiev   s myself it tasted pleasant I liked it. When we went home at the end of the evening there were quite a lot of nibbles left over but not the Bernard Mathews turkey Kiev   s , they had all gone . The outer breadcrumb coating firm. The batter contains wheat eggs and milk. The turkey meat was moist turkey.  In the centre of the turkey balls was the thick and creamy cheese and herb sauce this had oozed into and out of some of the Kiev   s.  Do be careful if you are eating these straight out of the oven they do get very hot and might burn your mouth , this is mainly the sauce .They smelt tasty garlicky and herby, the taste of garlic was not too strong though.  The Sauce contained cheese, milk garlic and parsley. The turkey meat is 100  breast and the Turkey is 100   British farmed in Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincolnshire. Each Kiev contains 47 calories, 223 kcal per 100gWhen I think of Kiev   s I usually think of chicken Kiev but these turkey ones worked well. I would certainly recommend for a party nibble or an easy dinner. A small word of warning, the packet states that although great care has been taken some small bones may remain. These Kiev   s contain Gluten, egg and milk. I did a little research and discovered that although one might assume that chicken/turkey Kiev is a Russian invention I have read that it is a French recipe given the name Kiev in New York. Chicken/turkey Kiev is not normally found in this mini ball form. It is usually a boneless chicken breast which is rolled around a portion of garlic and herb butter then baked. Would I recommend? Yes .                                          ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6739162:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6750576:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5840413:4:::5840413:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::6802070:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6474927:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6833727:4:::6805797:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Jumbo Kitchen Towel::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::10.05.2010::::    Is it value ?  I rarely use kitchen towels but I did buy some recently I personally think that kitchen towels are not environmentally friendly way of drying or wiping anything. They also tend to be expensive for a one use throw away item. I usually use washable cloths. Price~~~~~~Tesco value kitchen towels cost    1.12 for 2 rolls in a pack that   s 47p per 100 sheets , there are 120 sheets of kitchen roll on each pack. This is a cheaper than other kitchen roll brands sold by tesco. I could have chosen different coloured packs ones with seasonal pictures on but decided this value pack a plain white would do just fine  would not clash with my kitchen colours . Quality?~~~~~ The quality thickness of these paper towels is not as good as brand products I have used, but they are adequate for the purpose. They are reasonable absorbent Uses ~~~~~~I have used these towels for wiping sticky fingers, sticky faces, and other sticky messes.  I do use these in the house sometimes but I have flannels in the downstairs cloakroom for the children   s sticky faces and fingers I use washable dish or j cloths to wipe up spills.I have used them occasionally for wiping noses when no handkerchief or tissue to hand, better than tissues they are thicker. I do use these when we are going out in the car for a day trip for wiping. So basically these value kitchen roll are ok.

Green leaves grow on the stem which has large sprays of small flowers very delicate and papery. The flowers have small funnels and are star like. Statice is a plant my mum used to lover she would grow it in her flower borders. Mum would then cut them just before they come into full bloom to use some for her fresh flower arrangements and also dry some of the flowers for dried flower arrangements. They dry well best hung upside down in a warm ventilated place, mum used to dry her flowers in a garden shed. If you buy Statice plants from the garden centre plant them after the frosts in a sunny position. Statice do not need a lot of care just water in to get established. If it is dry, they might need staking if in a windy position. http://www.suttons.co.uk sell Statice seeds for    1.95 a pack of 80 seeds.

Florentnya body lotion is also available to buy on its own in a 250ml bottle for    4.00p this is a more attractive bottle with its cap being shaped like a rose bud. This white bottle comes in a White box which has a picture of a pink flower on it.The bottle can be squeezed and I did so and put a little of the white cream onto my hands.  This cream is quite thick not too runny.I sniffed and the smell was light and flowery very pleasant. The fragrance is gardenia, jasmine, lily of the valley, orange blossom and a very subtle musk undertone.  A soft smell it is not overpowering, clean soft and gentle. I gently massaged the lotion into my skin.  It absorbed well. This lotion left my skin feeling soft and left a light pleasant aroma.  I like this Florentyna body lotion and the other items in then Florentyna range by Marks and Spencer. It makes my body feel soft and smooth and lightly fragranced.

       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Nurse Outfit::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::27.04.2010::::    I bought my granddaughter this ELC nurse   s uniform For Christmas when she was only a month away from 3 years old.It now costs    12. from the E.L.C on or off line.  This nurse   s uniform will fit a child between 3 and 6 years old, height up to 116cm tall. Now my granddaughter is very small. I expect it might just be a bit big for her never mind, I expect we van take it in and up a bit somehow if necessary. This outfit is a very smart short sleeved white nurse   s dress. This has an apron attached to the front. The apron has a blue binding edging to it as does the collar and sleeve cuffs. The apron also has a printed on nurses watch this is at the top left hand side. The time on my granddaughters always     past 12 not sure if they are all the same. The back of the dress has the opening for putting it on, this has 4 poppers/ press studs.This nurse   s dress has a matching cap a stiff fabric band with a green cross on it. This does up with Velcro at the back. The back of the hat band overlapping quite a bit to allow for different head sizes. To complete the outfit there is a simple red cape. This fits over the shoulders. There is a small piece of Velcro on each of the shoulders of the dress and the cape has a small piece of Velcro on each of the shoulder seams of the capeThis nurses uniform is made out of polyester easy to wash in the machine on a cool wash, so not tumble dry or dry clean it, iron with a cool iron for the ward sisters inspection.This nurses outfit looks well made the fabric feels quite strong, it looks cute. I imagine it will last many, many play hours.Dressing up is fun all children like to dress up, we adults do too don   t we .Children love to pretend to be Nurses, Doctors, Policemen, Firemen.  This nurse   s uniform will encourage your Childs imagination. Very useful play for easing those fears about nurses and hospitals. Good play therapy for if they have to go into hospital or if mummy or daddy has to go in. This play uniform is good for encouraging social skills caring for others. At work (school) we have sometimes a hospital set up with nurses and doctors uniforms and a medical set. This is good not only for the theme people who help us. It will also help the children make friends and enjoy the company of others.  To compliment this uniform a medical kit is a good idea, fortunately my grandchildren already have one , an old fisher price one ( nearly 30 years  old  was my daughters, still excellent condition.) The ELC do one as do many other toy companies.My Granddaughter has started playing with her dolls putting them to bed caring for them, cuddling them asking what   s wrong when they cry. At 2    , 3 years olds your child   s imagination is wonderful. Children 4, 5 and 6 and older still love to pretend they are a nurse.  Who knows one of them might be a real nurse or doctor one day.  My granddaughter has played at nurses and hospitals frequently enjoying wearing this costume now she is 4 it still fits her.   Would I recommend?  Most definitely  yes     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6723034:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5816422:4:::6758309:4:::6824023:4:::6824023:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::3957:4:::6739162:4:::6833802:4:::6833802:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6495932:4:::6786865:4:::21963:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6743330:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6750576:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6781345:4:::6781345:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::6378505:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Living and Learning Animal Soundtracks::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.04.2010::::    The Galt game Animal sound track   s has been around for a few years now. It is a very popular game with my class of children. This game is an audio bingo, lotto like game.   The game comes in a fairly strong card box ours is still intact after many games, ok so the adult usually opens the box deals out the cards and puts it away. The box is a light green colour with a yellow panel. There are a few animal footprints and some animal pictures on the box as well as the words Animal soundtracks. Inside the 20 x 21.5 x 5 cm box is 30 different domestic and wild animal sounds. There are 4 different boards each with 9 different real animal photos on. The boards are a fairly thick card. Included in this set are 40 counters, 10 of each colour.  Now sit down and play this game with me. First lets give out the animal boards you can play this game with 2 -4 players, or you could just play it on your own as a matching exercise. Now give out the counters 10 of each colour to a player. Now I will switch on the CD. Listen to the animal sound.  T he sounds are real sounds that these animals make. Who has that sound place a counter over the picture? The pictures on the board are photos of the real animal. That   s right Jane you got the first sound right. Now the second sound. Well done Peter you got that sound tight too well matched. Next sound, Ohh are you sure John listen again do you think it was it the elephant or a dog yes well done it was the elephant. The CD continues with its 30 animal sounds until the first person completes their board.The animal sounds are cow, monkey, owl, chick, sea lion, dove, cat, cricket, cheep, cuckoo, seagull, rattlesnake, elephant, turkey, mouse, frog, lion, woodpecker, dolphin, donkey, guinea pig, gorilla, whale, rooster, bee, dog, goose, duck, horse, wolf all very realistic. Each sound is heard for a reasonable length of time to identify it.I play this game with a group of special needs children aged 6 and 7. It is suitable for children ages between 4 and 8 years old. The upper and lower age range can be larger depending on your child   s ability and how you adapt this game. The first time your child plays this game look at the lotto board together talk about and name the animals. The first time you play you may only play some of the CD and finish the game after only finding a few pictures. You can stop the CD after each sound and replay it if necessary. This CD is about 30 minutes playing time. Most of my children can concentrate for about that length of time while playing this.  The real sounds and real pictures make it attractive and interesting to play.This game is good for developing childrens listening and observation skills. Making the children aware of sounds.  My children enjoy making the sounds of the animals as they play this game too so it is helping their speech development.  It is a very useful game to play when doing animal topics.Would I recommend this game? Yes. There are also other Soundtrack available on different topics too.

       " '5247778::::Ravensburger Postman Pat Memory Game::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::22.04.2010::::    I often play memory games with the children at work some we have made and some bought ones. A memory game I was playing recently was the Postman Pat memory game from Ravensburger. Ravensburger is a firm that make many puzzles and card games.This game comes in a blue box with pictures of Postman pat on it and the words Postman Pat memory written on it. This game is suitable for those aged over 2.1/2 yrs old. . This may be a bit difficult for a 2     year old, but adapt the game only use some of the matching pairs build the game up till they are able to manage all the cards.  There are 24 cards in this set, 12 pairs. Theses are square cards quite thick, they should last many play hours they are not easy to bend and tear. We do have a few with tooth marks on though. All the characters from Postman Pat are there some of the characters are on more than one pair of cards but standing in a different position.  Each of the face of the cards has a thin white border and a bright background colour of red, green, blue, yellow, or orange .On the background stands the picture of a Postman Pat character. Each pair of cards is identical.So let   s play this game, first I will decide on the ability of the group I am playing with and decide how many pairs of cards to use. This game is suitable for between 2 and 6 children Ravensburger say 2 and 4. The children will be able to collect 2 to 12 pairs. I make it simple for my larges group and they only have to get 2 pairs each. The cards are then placed face down on the table, you could spread them all out face down on the floor.Now the aim of the game is to find as many pairs as you can. Let   s take turns. (Taking turns in itself is a good lesson). You have to remember where the cards are when you turn them over and can not use them.  Then when it   s your turn you can turn a pair over and win them .The person who turns over the most pairs is the winner. For a simpler game turn all the pictures face up and play the game finding the matching pictures. To encorage your children to observation skills you could play the game to find all the people who are wearing hats or all the people who are wearing glasses. Postman Pat is very popular with toddlers and young children. The children that I work with enjoy this game. These cards are available at http://www.puzl.co.uk  for    6.49 a lot of the other places advertising this game say it is out of stock.  Would I recommend ? Yes this is a good strong game It will encourage your childs concentration skills help their visual acuity . and help them learn how to take turns and play with others .     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5805376:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6723034:4:::21963:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5624457:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6789555:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6474927:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::6809614:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Rubies Power Rangers Jungle Fury Costume::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.04.2010::::    We had the dressing up costumes out last week and one that is popular is the Blue Power rangers muscle chest suit. The 6 year old boys loved putting this costume on and posing in the classroom, pretending to zap people and save the day. This costume is a blue polyester jump suit with long legs no feet the body has the 2 silver white stripes on legs. The body has 2 silver white stripes on from shoulders to waist and has the Blue Ranger s operation number 2 in gold printed on the centre of the chest. The chest of the costume and the upper arms are padded with foam to give the look of muscles. This is a long sleeved costume. There is a black belt which is attached this belt Velcro  s around the waist The costume has a back opening to ease putting this costume on , this has Velcro to close it. The costume if fairly easy to put on a few of the children did need a hand. This costume is hand wash and drip dry. To complete the costumer there is a mask this is a half mask made of plastic. This mask is Blue, black and white with some yellow. This fits on with elastic; it is fairly comfortable to wear. There are eye Slits in the eyes and mouth slits. So that the children can see and breathe while they wearing it. There are no boots with this costume, blue or black socks would complete the look. This suit is fairly well made I think it would easily last one child s enthusiasm for dressing up as a power ranger, it is withstanding use in my classroom fairly well. This suit is available in small 3/4 years old medium 5/ 6 years old or large 7/8 years old http://www.toysrus.co.uk/Toys-R-Us has this on sale for    21.95, http://www.amazon.co.uk has it for    29.95 The children in my group enjoy dressing up in this pretending to be their super hero s. The children posture and pretend fight and kick. Although this suit good for them to practice their dressing skills, I am not sure I really like the type of role play it encourages.      ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5661865:3:::5661865:3:::5624457:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6239064:3:::6239064:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::6820455:3:::5439461:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5335750:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::21963:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6834688:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6825517:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6830270:4:::6789555:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lucas World of Furniture, Aylesbury::::Shopping::::40::::very helpful::::19.04.2010::::    My three piece suite was many, many years old and looking shabby it had lost its firmness and support. Our three piece suite had withstood many upsets, tears, tea and squash. Had supported much weight and the clamouring of children on its arms and on its backs as well as the staid sitting of the older generation. So it was time to bid farewell.  We noted that a lot of furniture shops had sales on so armed with measurements we went searching. First we were lured into   some of the cheaper furniture warehouses and were really not satisfied with the look, the colour, the comfort or the potential durability. Or last three piece suite had lasted 26 years so we felt that if we were to buy a good well made suite from a good company as we had the last one, then with the family grown up it should last us our senior years.So we visited Lucus world of furniture in Aylesbury . Lucus World of furniture is situated on Rabans Lane just of the A41 Bicester road on the Edge of Aylesbury.  When you turn of Rabans lane towards the car parking at the back of the store you notice there are 2 showrooms one either side of the entrance road. Parking is adequate but not ample. I have previously been in both showrooms looking at different types of furniture and think they have a fair range. We went into showroom 2 as we were looking for a three piece suite and that   s where they are displayed. Lucus sell living room furniture, dinning room furniture, kitchen furniture, bedroom furniture, office furniture and many sundries.  There is a floor space of over 3o.ooo sq metres in these showrooms there are 2 floors lift available if you need it.Although there is a lot of it the furniture is laid out fairly well some of it into rooms some of it as a group of specific types of furniture. We walked around and sat on some of the sofas on chairs. A lady assistant came and asked us if we needed any help, we told her we were looking at 3 piece suites and we were nosing around and would come back in a bit to her for information about sizing when we had finished looking. Now the furniture in this shop is not cheap you are talking about from just under 2 to 3 thousand pounds for a Sofa and    6 00 to over    1000 for an arm chair. Fortunately we were looking at sale prices and although still expensive a little less than full price. We would not normally have the    4000 that it did cost us for the three piece suite but Dad had recently died and left us quite a bit of money so we decided to buy good quality furniture. We walked around the shop dismissing some of the sofas not to our taste, we found a couple 1 in particular that we liked we continued to browse on, sitting on several checking out the comfort, after completing a couple of circuits we sat on the three piece suite that we liked talked about it would it fit what fabrics and colours. The assistant came to see if we needed any help she showed us where the alternate fabric swatches were and offered a cup of tea and a few biscuits.We accepted the tea, hubby and I worked out the price. We decided although it was a lot more than the    1000 for a suite at some other furniture warehouses. The quality and style was so much better. We looked through the fabrics and decided on the one wee wanted. Our sitting room is difficult with strange corners and angles. Furniture is designed for standard rooms with straight walls and square corners a lot of modern furniture is huge with big cushions too big. Then the sizing now we wanted a small 3 seater sofa, a 2 seater too small a standard 3 seater too large. The design we choose had this option. The sales assistant helpful but not too in our faces, I hate that makes me run a mile.We were advised that it would be 6 weeks before we got our furniture as They had none of our precise requirements in stock, I believe that the furniture is possibly made or at least upholstered when ordered .. We gave Lucus a deposit the remainder to be paid a week or two before delivery. A few days later we received a call from the shop and we were told that regrettably they diodes not have the fabric that we required immediately. It would take another 5 or 6 weeks on top of the original 6 week wait. We could cancel our order change the fabric or wait we decided to wait we were not in a rush. About 10 days ago we paid the final payment and booked a delivery time. As you can imagine working in education one can not easily not go to work because you are having furniture delivered so we arranged a Saturday delivery. We asked for an early delivery so we were not hanging around all day . The day before delivery we were phoned to tell us the furniture would arrive at is   fantastic I rise early anyway and we would not have to spend the rest of the day hanging around waiting. So about 10 past 8 a red lorry with Lucus written on the side draws up outrside, two men get out, the doorbell rings one man checks it is the right house and delivery.  They put some Hessian type matting on my carpets from the front door into the lounge so that they do not get mud and water into the house; it was a foul wet morning. The two of them get the furniture out of the van; I hold my house doors completely open. The furniture just fits through the door into the sitting room. It   s not easy as it   s a slim hall with right angled doors. The men take the thick plastic covering off the three piece suite and poasition it where I requested, The delivery was on time they were quick and efficient.  I check the furniture , satisfied I sign the invoice and the delivery men depart it took them less than 15 minutes .   We rearranged and positioned the cushions sat on our new furniture and were satisfied.Lucus furniture shop has been established since 1898 it sells good quality modern and traditional furniture. It is a family run furniture shop selling quality furniture. I would certainly recommend looking there if you are after furniture.

       " '5247778::::Aerobie Pro Flying Ring::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::18.04.2010::::    Come on outside to play, .Let   s find an Aerobie ring. I have played with this ring with children aged over 12  in the senior department of a special needs school.  These Aerobie rings   are a 13 inch/ 32cm diameter hoop. This hoop is not tubular but flattened wide about 2 or 3 cm and 1/8th of an inch thick.. The edges of the ring are a soft rubber this makes them easy to grip and hold to catch and throw. If one hits your body it will not hurt much.  In the centre of the soft flattened rubber I see a black ring  not sure what this is made from but I imagine it   s a harder substance that gives the weight to the throw .and the coloured rubber is for protecting it and to aid flight. These rings are an alternative to Frisbees and balls. You can play a game on your own with these to see how far you can throw one just grip the ring and throw. The record throw is 1,333 feet 406 metres but the children I have played with this ring only manage a few feet. . Come on outside to play, yes I know its cold but its not raining and you will soon get warm.This ring held the Guinness World Record for  quot;longest throw of an object without any velocity-aiding feature in 2003 beaten by a boomerang throw in  2005.You can play a game with one or more friends throwing the ring to each other, it   s not to difficult to catch. This would be for great for playing with in the park or on the beach or in the garden, less risk of breaking a window with this toy than with a ball. This Aerobie ring comes in 3 bright colours orange, purple or yellow this makes them easy to see in the long grass and in the air as they are flying towards you.  Playing with this ring is a good way to keep fit running about after it. It will help you develop your throwing skills and make your arm muscles stronger too. Choose to play this in a group it is good for social skills. This Aerobie ring is made in America; Alan Adler invented /designed it in 1984.

       " '5247778::::Britains 40959 Heavy Horses::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::16.04.2010::::    I was tidying up my grand childrens toys to put them away in the   toy box at my house, one of the toys we had out was the farm and animals.  I was putting the horses away and looked under their bellies, here the name Britain   s is written. I or my grandchildren really have a complete set off the 4 heavy working farm horses. Item model number 40959 I purchased them at the local charity shop along with some other animals. To buy these 4 horses new will cost you    3.99 from http://www.farmtoysonline.co.uk.  They cost    4.00 from http://www.amazon.co.uk . I guess they will cost around that price at many toy and model shops.These horses are suitable for a child aged 3 years and over, they might be a bit small for a tot who still mouths everything. They are also suitable for granddad too as they are ideal for the scenery around a model train lay out.These toy model horses are made from plastic. They are very durable will last ages. They wash easily too.  The horse each measures about 61/2 cm tall and almost 8cm nose to tail tip. These horses have no moveable parts they are solid.  These horses are realistic looking; the black horse his legs in a trotting position with black tail has a white flash just on his nose. The brown horse has a black tail and mane and has white socks. The light tan horse has brown tail and mane and also has white socks his shoes are black. Then my favourite the completely white horse (Well mine is in the photo it shows the white horse with grey mane and socks.) He is all saddled up with his eye blinkers and bridle on.   These horses are not smooth but have marking on them from the mould they were made in the manes and tails are all textured.  The horses look great ready for work on the toy farm, my grandchildren enjoyed lining them up in the stables then one of the play mobile people rode one of the horses   to the Lego house. The Britain   s farmer came out to give them some food. Next the horses were galloped around the sitting room carpet field before going back to the stable. My 4 year old granddaughter was playing /moving the horses around doing the moving and the neighing of course.  I anticipate that these horses will get played with at my house for a couple more years before I pass them back to the charity shop. Would I recommend these model heavy horses?  Yes. These horses are great they are realistic and will help your child learn about and understand the world about them. Ideal for use in an animal topic. Use the correct name for the horse    features count their legs this will help your tots language development.Would I recommend these model heavy horses?  Yes.William Britain established a company 1893 to produce model military figures. In 1921 the first animals were produced. Britain   s toy company has been sold a couple of times I think the present owners are Racing Champions, who have continued to produce the Britain   s range. The range of farm vehicles and animals is really good. I have played with many.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::21963:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6820455:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::5335750:4:::6830270:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6757811:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5816422:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6750576:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6834218:4:::6378505:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This bag is suitable for a 3 year old and over.Front pocket~ On the  bright orange front pocket was a picture of Bob and Wendy standing on grass in front of a brick wall. They are all kitted out in their work wear with tools in their tool box. Bob and Wendy are both looking at you as if they are saying the words  quot;Come on we ve got a job to finish quot; These words are printed on the pocket in Yellow. The front pocket is an arched shape and has a zip around it. . I like this shape. The main bag compartment.~ This bag is an arched shape which is good. It is a blue bag and has an orange trim around it the carry loop at the centre top of the bag is orange too. There is a zip at the top of this bag. There are two adjustable padded straps so this bag can be carried on the back as a rucksack. Size: 32x25x9 cm. This is a good size for those school essentials letters to and from the teacher, a reading book and a snack. This Bob the builder rucksack is made of a strong fabric a type of nylon I think. I would expect this bag to last a full school year. This is a new design on bob the builder back packs for 2009 you can buy it in the high street or on line at http://www.restandplay.co.uk it cost    9.95 +   2.95 post and packing at Amazon it cost    3.70 +    4.43 shipping buy    35.00 worth of things from Amazon and the postage is free.

       " '5247778::::Eberhard Faber Fimo Effect 38 Metallic Saphire Blue::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::07.04.2010::::    I love playing with playdoh both the bought and home made, think it   s a great medium for children I used plastercine when I was a child. I have dabbled with real clay making pots, and I have discovered Fimo which is a soft oven hardening polymer modelling clay.  Fimo is a great medium for the child that has grown out of playdoh.  Fimo is suitable for children and Adults over 8 years old.  Supervision given as necessary, you know your child and thier capabilitiesFimo comes in a selection of 48 colours.  The colour Fimo I am talking about today is the Metallic Sapphire. Metallic sapphire is a fantastic metallic blue a gorgeous colour. All the Fimo colours are good. This is a soft Fimo much softer than the classic Fimo. It is easier for younger modelers to use than the classic. This Metallic Sapphire comes like all the other Fimo colour   s in a block pack wrapped in a clear plastic. There are some instructions on the pack. Each block measures 55x55x15mm, weighs 58g, and is segmented into 8 pieces for ease of use.This colour makes great jewelery or small metallic blue pots. You can also use this colour as part of another model with other fimo colours. Fimo colours blend easily together. If twisted together a lovely marbling effect can be made this Sapphire Blue looks great marbled with another colour Now what shall we make with this metallic sapphire Fimo.  I fancy making some metallic sapphire blue beads for a necklace. This Fimo soft clay is not as good as the Fimo classic clay if you wish to make a doll. This Fimo is lovely smooth and soft, it is ready to use once you take it out of the plastic wrapping. There is no need to knead it like clay. Fimo can be put in oven proof moulds or modeled by hand, it is really good for detail and  filigree workTo harden it put it in the oven at 130C/265F for 30 minutes. Once baked, it can be cut, drilled, painted, sanded, and sliced thinly. After Fimo has cooled down you can give it a great finish by varnishing. There is a Fimo varnish available. Now I have inspired you , You can buy a block of this Sapphire Blue soft Fimo and other colour s too for as little as    2.26 at Amazon     ::::5646482:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5415714:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::5816422:3:::5439461:3:::3728:3:::3728:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::21963:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5301762:4:::5301762:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5335750:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6474927:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Bubble Magic Bubble Tubs::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::31.03.2010::::    I recently bought a couple of tubs of Bubble Magic from a local shop for 25p each. These pots of bubble magic are available at many shops I think Tesco even sells them. These pots of bubbles are usually displayed in a card box which has pictures of bubbles across a pale blue background the stand up back has a picture of a rabbit standing in his top hat and tails smiling at you and waving a Magic bubble wand. These display boxes contain 24 pots of bubbles. You can buy these bubbles on line in bulk for a childrens party or event from http://www.charnwood-catalogue.co.uk where they cost    4.84 for a 4 packs of 6 boxes of 24 pots of bubbles they also sell some smaller packs too.These bubbles are non toxic and CE approved.The bubble tubs containing 60 ml of bubble mix are a plastic cylinder measuring 9 cm tall x 4 cm in diameter. They have a twist screw of cap which you open after pulling away the plastic seal. There are several coloured bottles available in a display pack yellow, red, blue, orange or green. These all have labels on featuring that rabbit holding his bubble wand and a warning that the bottle holds small parts and is not suitable for children under 3 years old.Now twist open the top and you will find a bubble wand attached. This bubble wand has one oval hole about 2     cm long.  Tap the drips of the bubble wand on the edge of your bottle place the oval hole loaded with bubble mix a few cms away from your mouth and blow gently. . That   s right not too hard just a gentle puff. Now I just did this and lots, about 30 small bubbles about 4 cm in diameter were blown (yes I caught one and measured it) slightly bigger bubbles can be blown if you control your blowing. The way my children enjoyed making some bubbles was to wave the bubble wand (after it was dipped in bubble solution) in the air.The bubbles this solution produces are rainbow colours and travelled a few metres with my puff. When blown outside they travel a long way in the direction of air movement before popping.  This bottle of magic bubbles contains a good bubble mixture not too thin the bubbles it produces are good.I don   t think there is any child, or adult who does not like bubbles they are fascinating, they are fun.  I often produce a bottle of bubbles at playtime the children love to blow them watch them floating across the playground, the children who are not blowing the bubbles will run-around and try to pop the bubbles.  I will for most of my children either hold the bottle for them while they dip and blow or use a bottle with only a tiny bit of bubble mix in it as I know how easily the bubble mix will get spilt / poured out. Although the age these are suitable for according to the bottle is 3 a baby and toddler will love to watch the bubbles you blow for them. Watch and eye tracks the bubbles flight and laughs when the bubble goes pop and disappears.As well as the fun my children have with these Magic bubbles these bubbles can be used as a tool in language development.To blow bubbles you have to have a round lip shape, this lip shape is used for the sounds oo, o, and w. if your child has problems producing this round shape gently squeeze their cheeks forward to get a round shape. Blowing bubbles will help your child to strengthen and position their tongue for the sounds keg, and ng. It also helps strengthen the tongue for sounds produced at the back of the mouth.Blowing exercises such as blowing bubbles position and strengthen the tongue for sounds produced in the back of the mouth.Blowing will also strengthen abdominal muscles if you blow streams of bubbles rather than just one puff, this will help your child lengthen their sentences. Working with special needs children or babies you can use bubbles to encourage eye contact. Have fun blowing bubbles, your child will show anticipation of more bubbles. If you wait for eye contact before blowing more bubbles your child is learning to look at people and get eye contact. Your child is making a request asking by looking at you for more bubbles.Bubbles can also be used as a tool for language teaching them the word for more, again, please, want, finished, These can be oral words that you teach the child by saying them and your child repeating them or they can be sign language we use signs at our school to help the children understand and express themselves when they have language difficulties. Turn taking is something important we try to teach our children, even if you are blowing bubbles with just your only child then take turns yourself teaching them my turn, your turn. I had a group of 3,  6 year old special needs children in the playground today turn taking blowing bubbles ,its not easy they all knew my turn,  not so good on your turn . So would I recommend bottles of Magic bubble mix? Yes it is a good bubble mix that produces good bubbles a good shaped blower. They make a good cheap treat , ideal for  party goody  bags. Go on blow a few bubbles you know its fun .      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5347743:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::6781956:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6775406:4:::6775406:4:::6654507:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::6786865:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::5022914:4:::5022914:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6723034:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::3957:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6806997:4:::6806997:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6145850:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5816422:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5335750:4:::5790028:4:::6495932:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6750576:4:::6789555:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5203100:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6378505:4:::5661865:5:::5661865:5:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

These biscuits come purple wrapped with a picture of a single biscuit on the plastic wrapper. Tesco fruit shortcake biscuits are round frilly edged biscuits dotted with pin prick holes. They are a golden brown and covered in sprinkles of sugar. Although not very thick these biscuits look hearty and satisfying. Taking a bite or two these biscuits are quite crumbly, although they are not soft they do not have a hard bite. These biscuits taste good the shortbread quite buttery although some of the currants a little small and hard most is not. The fruit in these biscuits are currants. These may not be the best shortbread biscuit but they are a nice biscuit. These biscuits are sweet and yes after one I want to eat another and another. They do not dunk well, fall to pieces in a cup of tea. . There are 499 kcal per 100 g 46 cal per biscuit. These fruit shortcake biscuits contain Gluten, Oatmeal, Wheat   Wheat Flour and May contain Nuts I can not see dairy products in the ingredients but do check I may be mistaken on that count .

       " \"5247778::::Pintoy Doll's Buggy::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::26.03.2010::::    This wooden dolls buggy/ pram from Pin toys have been available for several years now. We have one in our nursery department. It is a couple of years old now and it seems to be very durable and is well used. This Pram, sorry Pintoy I dislike the term buggy is advertised by Pintoy as been suitable for over 3 year olds however I think its suitable for younger children. It may be a bit large for a 1 year old but it should be a good height for a 2 year old Its size  55 x 34.5 x 50.5 cm/21.5 x 13.5 x 19.75 in. I would recommend this as a first pram as it is stable and fairly weighty. The wheels turn easily so sturdy to push. It is not as flimsy and easy to fall over as some of the cheap plastic ones.The pram is made from rubber wood it is well made I can see no sharp edges or small parts that are easily removed... If you are using this toy with an under 3 then supervise them    just in case they fall over while pushing it. Use this pram on a flat surface away from the top of steps a child under 3 may not have the awareness of the dangers in getting to near stairs or trying to take the pram down steps.This pram is probably more attractive to look at for adults rather than children. The dolls pram as it is a simple traditional design.  It has curved sides with the head end being higher than the foot end. The sides are pink the   ends of the pram plain wood colour. The handles are a smooth rod, coloured pink this is attached either side to plain wooden struts attached to the body of the pram.  The wheels are attached to this strut. The wheels are circular wooden ones with a rubber tyre fitted into a groove around the circumference of the wheel I believe this pram /buggy comes flat packed but I think it must be fairly easy to construct as when I look at it  there are just a few screws  fixing the body  of the pram together and fitting the handle and the wheels on also. I just checked on line and 16 screws and fitting instructions come in the box that contains this pram.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719918:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::21963:4:::6830992:4:::6830992:4:::3957:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6739162:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6750576:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6723034:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6378505:4:::6792895:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6740155:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6821514:4:::6821514:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6830511:4:::6830511:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5022914:4:::5022914:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6820455:4:::6830270:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::6785596:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

One is this Baby bigjigs Colourful Wooden Rolling Shape Sorter. This toy is suitable for a one year old and older. This toy is made of wood from replenished sources. It has 2 natural coloured wooden discs about 4 inches in diameter. These have each got three shapes cut out of them. These discs are attached together with brightly coloured pieces of doweling about 9 in/22cm long. There are 6 coloured 3d shapes to post into the shape holes. There is a yellow triangle, a purple cylinder, a green L shaped piece, an orange square, a blue cross, a red semi circle. These shape pieces are a good size to hold and push through the correct holes. Your child will have fun and be proud when they post the correct shape. This toy being a cylinder will roll among the floor or table.I think this is a good toy fun and educational, plenty to talk about. The colours, the names of the shapes, counting the shapes. Do remember to talk to your children and extend their language while playing. This Big jigs shape sorter is a good toy it is well made. It is   ideal for home or   early year   s centres.

       " '5247778::::Party Ark Rocket Whizzer::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::22.03.2010::::    I has a great time at Christmas watching my grandchildren open and play with their toys. My sister had sent them a parcel including this Rocket whizzer for my grandson aged 7.I remember as a child  getting a couple of disks of card and colouring them then making a hole through the middle and threading some wool through the hole . Then with the discs central to the length of wool I would twirl it round and round and round then I would pull and release the tension on the wool and my card discs would twirl whiz round and round . Now the Rocket whizzer that my sister bought works on the same principal. The card discs are replaces by a thin wooden disc about 70mm wide. The base colour of the disc being yellow .This is not completely circular as there is the nose of the rocket at one end and the tail at the other. The rocket is painted on to the disc it is red with orange nose, tail, and fins  It   s a simple rocket shaper with a black circle to represent a window and a few black markings on it . Through the centre of the disc is a hole through which a fairly thick cord   doubled up goes through. (I can not remember how long this cord was, sorry)(The length of the cord not too long for a 4 year old not too short fur an adult) A t either end of the cord was a piece of coloured doweling about 3 or 4 cm in length. Now place the rocket half way along the cord Hold a piece of doweling in each hand and twirl and twirl the rocket. When the cord is twirled to your satisfaction (or your arms about to drop of) pull on the cord and doweling at the ends and the rocket will whizz and whizz round. Pull release tension, pull release  tension again and again the harder you pull the faster it whizzes when you have the rocket whizzing round well it will hummmm , make a noise. My grandson could just do this after being shown and did play with it a little, but the grown ups got the most fun out of this toy on Christmas day. My daughter reported to me that my grandson does play with it a little but she finds it quite addictive. I think this toy has stayed downstairs in the sitting room and she finds herself picking it up twirling and whizzing the rocket round and round. The website I checked suggests it   s suitable for aged 3 and over I would suggest better maybe for 4 /5 year olds and over. This toy is quite well made I can see it lasting a long time. I wonder if it might become a playground fad like we used to with our card whizzers.  This toy is quite atractive and very cheap really (well there   s not much to it is there).  This Rocket whizzer costs:    1.75 from http://www.petitesouris.co.uk or    1.49 at http://www.bearlythere.co.uk. I am not sure if you can but it   s the sort of toy you might buy at Hawkins bazaar. Would I recommend? Yes it is a good fun cheap toy which must also be good exercise as I know my arm muscles aches after playing with this toy for a while.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6443287:4:::6443287:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6785596:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5816422:4:::6788991:4:::6788991:4:::6145850:4:::5646482:4:::6809845:4:::6809845:4:::6290957:4:::6802070:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6809614:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6378505:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6474927:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galt Whose home? Photo Puzzle::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::17.03.2010::::    This term we are doing a topic on animals in my class of 6 year old special needs pupils. One of the puzzles we have been doing is the    Galt whose home   . This box of puzzles is suitable for children aged 3 to 6 years old. I have also used this puzzle when doing a topic on homes.Inside an orange box which has a plastic carry handle are 10 puzzles. Each puzzle has 2 pieces .Each puzzle fits together with a male and a female cojoining fitting. These puzzles are made of a thick strong card and have a wipe clean surface. Each puzzle is about 100mm x 180mm. The puzzle pieces are quite large and chunky, easy for little hands to pick up and position the correct pair together. The animals will only fit with their correct home piece.The ten animals include a dog, a cat, a horse, a bird, a rabbit.  The puzzle pieces are white with a very clear picture of the animals on it. The pictures of the animal homes are also very clear easy to identify too. The children I work with enjoy these puzzles. They are quite easy to put together. I only give the less able pupils 1, 2 or 3 animals and their homes to piece together. The more able pupils able to work with the whole set of ten pairs of puzzles.  A child might do this on his/her own or as a group activity.I place the puzzle pieces picture s upwards on the table. The child will pick up an animal and a home and try to fit them together. While then child is doing this I will ask them what is that animal called. Ask them the name of the animal   s home. I might ask the chid where they live. I can use the puzzles to talk about the animals ask how many leg   s, ear   s, eye   s. These puzzles are really good simple ones. They will give your child practice at their hand eye coordination skills and willl help them learn about animals. Doing a simple puzzle will give your child a sense of achievement. It will help their concentration skills. Starting with simple puzzles like this then building up is good builds childrens confidence. I think this two piece puzzle set is really good. Galt make really good toys, this toy should last a long time. Galt toys are well designed and are good for home or school use.James Galt and co has been around for many years, first as an educational stockist in 1836 then in the 1850 developing into printing and publishing. In 1961 Galt toys was formed producing toys for fewer than ten year olds. In my career working with young children I have played with many Galt toys and consider them to be quality toys well made and well designed me would never have any problem recommending them. This toy is available from http://www.amazon.co.uk for    3.91, or at http://www.kidandyou.co.uk for    5.

       " '5247778::::Marbel Plan Toys 60141 Road Construction Set::::Family::::30::::very helpful::::16.03.2010::::    Plan Toys Wooden road Construction Vehicles This set of road construction vehicles by Plan are some we have in the toy box at work. This set of 3 vehicles includes a crane a bulldozer, a road roller and an excavator. When I first got these out for the children I thought them rather cute and lovely toy representations of the real vehicles. These vehicles measure Bulldozer: 7 x 5 x 4cm. Road Roller: 6.5 x 4.5 x 4cm. Excavator: 10 x 3.5 x 7.5cm.  So are quite small really they will easily fit in a child   s hand. All these vehicles are made of rubber wood the vehicle body a bright yellow the base a natural colour. The   Excavator has a natural colored arm with a yellow scoop bucket. The yellow cab has grey windows painted on and some black warning markings on the side of the vehicle. The arm lifts quite well. A plain wood base with wheels attached is fitted to the yellow body of this vehicle. The wheels have a rubbery caterpillar tracking on them. The roller has a bright yellow body and a natural steam funnel on it. The natural coloured Roller is attached to yellow fittings. Again the windows are painted /stained grey and there are a couple of black markings on the side of the vehicle. There are 2 wheel attached to this vehicle white centres and black tyres. Now the bulldozer has a yellow cab with the grey windows and black markings.  Black caterpillar track attached to three white wheels. Then the wide yellow scoop is attached to the vehicle with natural coloured fittings. These vehicles all look attractive and are a good size to play with, alongside the model train set. The roller moves round fairly well and the digger bucket lifts well. Occasionally the caterpillar tracking and the tyres will come of this vehicle. Sadly the crane body keeps coming apart from the base. This set is played with quite roughly by my students, so probably if played with by just one child it may last longer. These vehicles would be ideal to add to a model scene. Ideal size for the plan toys road or rail toys.Your child will be practicing his/her motor skills while playing with these toys, they will be a resource for pretend play your child [pretending they are rolling the road flat or using the crane and the roller on their imaginary world road.  They will learn the different functions of the real vehicles by playing with these toys. These tots are suitable for those over three years old but I think older more like 5 would be better.  These road construction vehicles by Plan toys are   really attractive toys they have no sharp edges. They are produced using Chemical Free Rubber Wood which have ceased making latex. A proprietary, non- used formaldehyde E-Zero glue is used sticking them together. These little vehicles are quite eco friendly, It   s sad ours fell to pieces really, But I do feel it was the way they are used / abused that caused this. Would I recommend these toys? Well not all of ours have fallen to pieces and I think we can fix them  so for a child who is not rough and is using them  more in the model making scene way of play than the rough push it hard around the table then crash it into as many other vehicle then throw it on the floor type of play  then , yes I would recommend .

       " '5247778::::Parasene Boxer Garden Wheelbarrow - 90 Litre::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::14.03.2010::::    The old metal wheelbarrow that my dad gave me donkeys years ago finally got too many holes in it and rusted away. I treated myself to a new wheelbarrow, a Parasene 903 boxer poly wheelbarrow. Parasene is a firm that makes lots of garden equipment. I ordered my new wheelbarrow from http://www.twowests.co.uk.  Where this wheelbarrow now cost    43.75, I note you can buy this for    33.00 including postage on eBay. At http://www.diytools.co.ukit costs    29.99 I note on a comparrison website manyb storesare selling this with the price varying between    29 and    45 there may of course be postage on the cheaper sites. A lot of sites say this wheelbarrow comes flat packed , hard to flat pack a wheelbarrow, this just means the  frame l comes flat not the  polypropene body.The wheel is 400mm it has a pneumatic tyre size 31cm/ 12 in I am quite pleased with my wheelbarrow it is fairly light and easy to push. The metal handles have a rubberised grip. The pan, the body of the wheelbarrow is polypropylene, green coloured.   The pan measures 830 x 630 x 270mm and will carry 85 litres. This size is certainly good for garden use carrying compost, grass cuttings, tree prunings.  The grandchildren have also enjoyed being wheeled about in it too although they are now a bit heavy for me. This wheelbarrow makes it easy to carry heavy or bulky items. My wheelbarrow must now be between 3 and 5 years olds , the frame is advertised as rust resistant I an sad to see rust developing on the metal frame. Sadly I have to keep my wheelbarrow outside it fits on top but not inside my small shed so it is exposed to all weather.Overall I am happy with my wheelbarrow so much lighter and easier to push than my old one      ::::6750576:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5719918:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::21963:4:::3957:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5335750:4:::6755322:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6789555:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::6410840:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6739162:4:::6809614:4:::6798592:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5816422:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6378505:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::chad valley musical TV::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.03.2010::::    Have you a tot over 9 months old that you want to buy a toy for? This Chad valley musical TV might be the present you want to give. It is available from http://www.argos.co.uk for    3.99 usual price    6.99. Argos has now taken over selling Chad valley toys instead of Woolworths. I admit it s a long time since I have played with this toy, but it is in one of the Special needs nursery classes I have worked in This TV is a slim blue plastic rectangular toy it has a green carry handle. The front of the TV has a screen to view the picture through. The red Chad valley label in one corner of the surround. A yellow dog with green spots decorated the other side of the screen. There is a round circular control to twist and an on off switch. This toy will encourage your child to use their fine motor skills to click push the switch from off to on. Then twist the red dial around as far as they can. When the control is released the pictures will wind past the screen showing your child different scenes some with animals playing football. While the screen changes music is played. These are familiar nursery tunes. The tunes are not harsh, they may get on your nerves after a bit but they do not last long and are not those awful American accents in tunes which we often hear on Vtech toys (sorry if I offend but I really do not like the American accent on some of the Vtech toys.) Tots like looking at the pictures as they change. This toy can be used as a language tool. Point to the pictures and name the items. Sing along to the music. At this price I would say it s a good deal. This toy is quite robust should last a long time. Chad valley is an English firm making toys. Toys were made in the late 1800 s early 1900 s in Birmingham the Chad valley firm having its roots in a printing and book binding business      ::::5891:3:::5891:3:::6828299:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5719918:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::21963:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6310942:4:::6145850:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6757811:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6820455:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::6750576:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6739162:4:::6809614:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Corgi Police Car (Range Rover- Met)::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::11.03.2010::::    Corgi makes lots of toy cars they have been making toys since 1956. Digging around in the school toy box I came across a Corgi Range Rover Metropolitan (57601). Children love to play with the police car on our road mat and with our toy car garage. This corgi police car is a metal dye cast car. It is a realistic copy of the real thing. With the lights on top of the car and POLICE written on the bonnet and sides of the car. The metropolitan police badge and blue and yellow checks on the side of the vehicle. The rear window opens it has drop down rear door   opening driver   passenger doors. This model car is 1:64 size We have the play road mat out two little boys playing with the cars. I see one child on his knees pushing the police car around and screeching nee naah nee nahh then of course bashes into his friends car several times saying you under arrest. The children do like this car. Why is it a lot of their car games end up with bashes and crashes? We use this car when we are talking about people who help us, or when we are doing a transport topic. This car like other corgi cars is well made and should last many play hours, ours is looking a bit tatty but it does not get as much care taken of it as a Childs one at home. If you wish to buy this police car you can at Acorn store through Amazon for    9.99 or    7.99 from http://www.corgi.co.uk, http://www.abbiegailsgifts.co.uk has it for    3.99 Corgi make many other police cars and vehicles from different regions around the country, choose this london one or one from the region you live in .      ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5522492:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5687589:3:::5687589:3:::6739162:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6758966:3:::6758966:3:::6784650:3:::6784650:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6738963:3:::6738963:3:::6811202:3:::6811202:3:::5816422:3:::6750576:3:::6818102:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6795162:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::21963:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::6827586:4:::6827586:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::6723034:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6757811:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Britains 42022 - Case IH JX1075C TractorScale::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::06.03.2010::::    I like playing farms on the floor with the children .No farm is complete with out a tractor or two or three, or even more. The farm I play with is a mix and match set all types of animals and vehicles of different sizes. The Britain   s jX1075C 42O22 tractor is a 1:32 scale model of a real tractor. I do not know enough about real tractors to say anything here. It does look realistic and as such is good either for a child to play with or a more serious model maker to use in their country farming scenes. This model the same scale as Hornby trains OO gauge. Britain   s say this toy suitable for a child aged over 3 years old. I wonder if a 3 year old would appreciate its reality they might prefer a plastic tractor.The children I have played with this tractor range from 3 to 8 years old and they do seen all to enjoy playing with it.To me a tractor is most attractive in red and this one is a red tractor. It is a dye cast metal and as such will last for many years.This tractor is a classic design the big black wheels bigger ones at the back than the front it has a cab with plastic see through windows. Inside you can see a black molded seat and steering wheel. It has a red roof. This is a detachable cab and the whole cab unit can be removed. This is not so easy for 3 year olds but a 5 year old can remove it easily. There is a   black pipe sticking up from its bonnet, the exhaust pipe I believe. There is a hitch on the back so other toys can be attached. There are many Britain   s farming tools that will attach to this hitch .This toy is good it   s realistic. Not only do we play with it on the floor but it is a good prop for any story about tractors. Would I recommend this tractor ? Yes it   s a  well made realistic one .     ::::5522492:3:::6816400:3:::6816400:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6827483:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::21963:4:::6723034:4:::6820455:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6474620:4:::6474620:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6757811:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tobar Mini Picnic Basket::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::04.03.2010::::    Come on Dolly, come on Teddy lets go for a picnic. Let s get the hamper ready, look it s a small wicker basket that measures about 16 x 10 x 8cm when closed. This basket has a small carry handle on it, a grown up can just get their hand through it, its easy for a child to carry. This is a miniature just like the real adult one. This basket is well made and should last well. Shall we sit here to have our picnic. Open the basket, that s right there is a metal twist catch on that leather strap. Open up and inside the basket has a red gingham check lining on the base and the lid. There is some moulded clear plastic which the tea set fits into. Ahhh look it s a miniature tea set its really cute. Real ceramic items and look each piece has a cute picture of a teddy on them. There are 4 cups plates and spoons in this set from Tobar that is sold through Amazon, http://www.amazon.co.uk for    6.30 but I note that http://toyday.co.uk is selling this basket with only as 2 cup tea set - the spoons for    5.99. The difference seems to be that in the one sold through Amazon there are items in the bottom and the lid of the basket, but in the Tobar one only items in the base of the basket. The tea set is the same design. I notice that at http://toyday.co.uk. The tea set product 4096 is a 4 piece tea set the same teddy design selling for    14.99 In the basket that is advertised here there are four ceramic cups, plates and spoons as well as a tiny teapot, milk jug and sugar bowl. These items fit the places in the moulded plastic well and do not move about much when carried. The picnic set is really attractive a lovely picture of a teddy and a real ceramic, ooh better be careful you do not drop them. Actually these ceramic items are fairly strong stronger than you might think. If you have a child who might play with thise set roughly and throw it around then I would suggest a plastic set better. The shape of the picnic set is really attractive, I love miniatures. Let s put them out on the tablecloth I have on the floor (It s too snowy and cold to go outside today). There is not really enough room for food inside this basket you might just fit in a couple of wrapped biscuits. So I have a carrier bag with a bottle of juice and a packet of biscuits and a packet of crisps. You could spend time before taking dolly /teddy on a picnic by making real sandwiches remember to cut them small. Find some snacks for your picnic makes it realistic. Lay out on the tablecloth this set looks good let s play. Pour some juice /water from the bottle into the teapot (careful don t spill it) put the lid on the tea pot. You could add some to the milk jug too, not much a couple of spoonfuls at most. The little sugar pot is cute has a mini lid. A couple of dolly mixtures will just about fit in. I am sure your child will find something to put in the sugar pot or will just pretend to spoon sugar from it into the tea. Now we have arranged the tea cups nicely on the saucers (can not remember the last time I had a real cup and saucer mugs seem to be used more .) Careful pouring a little drink from the teapot into the cups. Now you can drink your drink from the cup. (It s only a mouthful 2 mouthful s at most; still you can always have more.) There are 4 little spoons you can stir the drink with these. Now something to eat? The plates are about 3     cm in diameter just big enough to put your biscuit or a few raisins on. Yum yum they were tasty. Have we finished our picnic snack now? Yes then let s put the empty cups and tea set back in the basket. Who s going to walk it home to the kitchen? Now we can wash it up in warm water and washing up liquid. Dry it after and put it back in the basket for next time. Yes you can take it and pretend play with no food for dolly, there s a box of play food somewhere you can use. Now while the children are playing let me finish my review. This is a lovely tea set in a basket. Nicer, but more fragile than plastic ones. The basket is great keeps everything together. Lots of play value here, Imaginary play, Social skills, learning about sharing and giving. . You can use this set to role play use as a revisit toy. You can introduce early math s counting the cups saucers plates, putting them into sets. You can use this set for language development naming the items talking about the cute teddy pictures. Good for fine motor skills too. This set would be fine for a child aged over 3 years old up to about 6 or 7. It is a really sweet cute set. Would I recommend? Yes      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633146:4:::5522492:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5719918:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6612341:4:::6145850:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::21963:4:::5255134:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5646482:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6723034:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5335750:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6824727:4:::6603737:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6410840:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6752066:4:::6752066:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5816422:4:::6781956:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6378505:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6820455:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6474927:4:::6735325:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Chocolate Tray Bake::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.03.2010::::    This cake, a chocolate tray bake from Tesco s often finds its way into the school where I work. I work in a special needs school and when it is one of the childrens birthdays we celebrate it in class. The parents of the birthday child usually send in a cake or goodies for their child to share with his/her class. The children sit round the table at snack time and have a drink of water or milk the child then will blow a candle out on their cake and we share. This tray bake is one that I have had a couple of children bring into school. I could see the chocolate cake through the clear plastic window in the  box. I slide out the rectangular tray the cake is seated on. This cake is really quite large. I placed the cake on a plate and placed some candles in the thick chocolate butter cream that covered this cake. This butter cream is covered with a scattering of milk chocolate covered malt balls and has some other milk and white chocolate decorations scattered on too. Being a chocoholic I could not wait till I had my piece. I cut some pieces however I had to wait while little Johnny had happy birthday sung to him and the candles blown out. Then I cut this in small pieces for the children to have and a few pieces for the staff too. This cake will be enough for 15 fairly good slices. This cake cut well. After the children had eaten theirs I had my piece .It is a moist well flavoured chocolate sponge type cake under the chocolate butter cream. The cake is a good texture. The cake was not too sweet really but as I said there was a good covering of sweet chocolate butter cream. I would certainly recommend this cake for a chocolate cake lover. Made an excellent birthday cake and it would be easy to tart up with added decorations. This cake also appears in the staff room sometimes as when a member of staff has a birthday it is custom to bring a birthday cake or tin of biscuits in to share. To buy this cake just go to your local Tesco s cake aisle it will cost you.    4.48 Although there are no nuts in this cake it has been made in a factory where nuts are used. It is suitable for a vegetarian, Contains: Milk, wheat, gluten, Egg, Soya. Now the bit I care not to think about, there are 420 kcal per 100g that works out about 210 kcal for a serving if this cake is cut into 15 pieces which is a good serving size. Wopuld I recvomend ? Yes please when its your childs next birthday teacher will love this . ...............................................

       " '5247778::::Alligator Peppa Pig Sticker Box::::Family::::40::::helpful::::02.03.2010::::     I bought my 4 year old granddaughter a pack of 200 Peppa Pig reusable stickers from the book club at work they cost me    2.50. I see Amazon has them for    2.50. These stickers come in a rectangular box with a see through window. Inside the box are 12 different coloured rolls with stickers on. There are some stickers smaller than others. The stickers all feature Peppa pig or her friends a few just say Peppa pig. These stickers being reusable are ideal for my granddaughter to stick in her Peppa pig sticker book or on her bedroom door, her toys any where. She has used a lot of them to stick on to her plastic Peppa pig house and car. These stickers are reusable. They seem to come of the waxed paper in her sticker book and the plastic house fairly easily and stuck back on somewhere else. I imagine after a few changes they will lose that stickiness. The Stickers Cassie stuck to her coat however did not restick so easily. These stickers are Fine My granddaughter likes them they amuse her for a while and decorate her Peppa pig toys. They suit the purpose and are I think worth the    2.50 of my hard earnt money. Peppa Pig is much loved by many 2-5 year olds and these would make a good present. Stickers can be used as a behaviour reward so if you have a child who loves Peppa pig you could use these as their reward sticker.      ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::6828753:3:::6145850:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::21963:3:::3957:3:::6391230:3:::6391230:3:::6739162:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6740155:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6784650:3:::6784650:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5816422:3:::5840413:3:::5840413:3:::6474927:3:::6378505:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6824143:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6474620:4:::6474620:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6723034:4:::6820455:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Vehicles: Petrol Station 5640::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::01.03.2010::::    Oh no that little blue Lego Duplo Duplo car has broken down again. Never mind we can tinker with the engine, change the tyres, and fill it up with petrol at the Lego 5640 Duplo: Petrol Station. A child that I know was given this as a present it   s suitable for a child aged between 3 and 5. This Lego Duplo petrol station toy costs    17.99 at Amazon and http://www.toysrus.co.uk has it for    19.95.This Duplo Petrol station has 24 pieces. They are a car body, a brick for the car engine. 4 wheel   4 bricks plus a hose to make up the air machine to pump up the tyres and a wrench/spanner. There is also a screwdriver. There are 5 standard bricks and a Duplo man.   The rest of the bricks make up the petrol pump.  The air brick and the petrol pump control bricks have markings on them so they look    realistic    The air hose will really fit into the wheels by the side of the tyres. The petrol pump will fit in too. The screwdriver will fit into the centre of the wheels to remove them. The spanner fits the Duplo studs on the engine.  So not only is it fun constructing this set, once constructed your child can play with it. They pretend to be the garage man removing wheels, tinkering with the engine. Fill up with petrol and air.  They learn how to look after a cat at an early age.  You will find your child copying how you fill the car up. Do get down and play with your child.  Get the other Duplo cars, bricks and people and make the garage very busy. Talk to your child and use the correct language they will soon pick up the right names for the tools. This toy can be played with by one child on their own add more cars and bricks and your child can play with other children too.Before 3 years old a child will play alongside but not really with another child,  Once they get to be around 3 you will notice the difference  playing cooperatively with another child .Playing together will teach your child social skills  sharing , co operating and will help develop language. This Duplo Petrol station will help your child   s fine motor skills develop will develop their construction skills as well as their imaginative play. I really like this Duplo   petrol station. I think Duplo Lego is a great toy and would recommend for home and nursery /early years centers.  Duplo is bright coloured, the plastic bricks easy to wash. Duplo was introduced by Lego in 1969, they are conjoining bricks twice the size of Lego bricks.  There isn t much that will break a Duplo brick, a child may chew it but the bricks are very resilient show little damage. They will last for many play hours. My grandchildren play with Duplo bricks that were their mothers 30 years ago.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5522492:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5719918:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::21963:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6805797:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::6367664:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6739162:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6735325:4:::6410840:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6824143:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6723034:4:::5816422:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5203100:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Peppa Pig & George Deluxe Lunch Bag::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::27.02.2010::::     Supervise children eating lunch at school, some of the children on my table have packed lunches. One of the children has just got a new lunch bag it is a Peppa pig one. I have been interested as my granddaughter is Peppa pig crazy, This bag is rectangular it is a bright blue. On the front PVC panel is a picture of Peppa pig, George and Dan the dog eating their lunch at a table? Their lunch looks healthy, there is fruit a drink in a box and they are holding their bread rolls. The characters look happy as if they are enjoying their lunch. Above the characters it says quot; mmmm lunch with Peppa and George quot;, underneath them it says  quot;yummy, yummy oink  quot; The bag looks bright and jolly it will appeal to those Peppa pig fans. The rest of the outside fabric is blue canvas fabric. The interior is a silver white wipe clean nylon PVC fabric.If this bag gets really messy then a wash on a gentle cycle in the washing machine should be fine . The bag has a handle on the top for carrying, no shoulder strap. The strap is a good size for either a child s or an adult s hand. The size of the bag is (H) 20cm x (L) 8cm x (W) 24cm, it has zipped access around the sides and the top with a Peppa Pig Logo Fob on the Zip itself. This zip allows one side to fully open and easy full access to the interior of the bag and lunch. After a thorough investigation I decided the seams are strong and should not come apart easily. The handle well fitted should take being swung about a bit. The bag is wipe clean it is a plastic nylon PVC type fabric it is insulated, this will help keep food cool maybe pop a freezer cool block in the bag in the summer if you are packing yoghurts.. This bag measures 24cm x 20cm x 8cm. It is a good size for a drink a sandwich box a bag of crisps and some fruit. You should be able to buy this bag for under a tenner at http://www.matalan.co.uk it costs    9.60; at http://www.amazon.co.uk it costs    9.12p. I notice at some outlets it is sold with a drink bottle and sandwich box at other outlets sold without. , if you are buying the bag on line it will tell you on the description if you are just buying the bag or the bag and accessories. The picture showing this item in the category here on dooyoo has a plain blue drinks bottle and sandwich box. If your child wants Peppa pig pictured on their drinks bottles and sandwich boxes they can be bought separately. This bag is made by Spearmark housewares founded in 1908 they are an international firm who make many character lunch bags and tableware. This Peppa pig bag certainly seems well made and durable. I think it should last until your child outgrows Peppa pig. If my granddaughter still is a Peppa pig fan when she starts school after the summer then I might well buy her this bag.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5719918:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::21963:4:::6757811:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6723034:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5790028:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5021331:4:::5021331:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6410840:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6699566:4:::5816422:4:::6474927:4:::6739162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6735325:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6710719:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::5249006:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6750576:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Rubies Power Rangers Operation Overdrive Muscle Chest Costume::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.02.2010::::    I have a group of 6 year old boys in my class and they all love the power ranger costumes that we have especially the red one. These costumes also come in blue and black. This costume comes in small to fit 3 to 4 year olds, medium to fit 5 -7 year olds and large for 8 to 10 year olds. With this jumpsuit also comes a mask with a belt and a buckle. This costume is mostly red with silvery white panels we have another power rangers costume which has black markings. The one I am describing is like the one in the picture here. It has the power ranger s emblem on the chest. The chest of the costume is padded top look muscular. This costume is an all in one outfit. It has boot tops stitched into the legs but the feet of your child not completely encased the sole is free. I must admit although the children love power rangers I am not over keen on the play this encourages. All that kicking, jumping around and posturing. My students dress up in this in the classroom but I think it would be best if after they are dressed in it they went out side to run about and jump. However this is a good costume for the childrens dressing skills learning to put feet in the correct leg holes pulling the legs of the costumer up, putting their arms in. this has a large kneck opening at the back so your child will not need to button or zip themselves in. This costume is made from a nylon fabric, hand wash only cold water. Drip dry  The one we have seems to be fairly well made  it has been worn quite often taken on and off.If you want one for your child then http://www.amazon.co.uk/ has a couple on sale for    10.00      ::::5997493:3:::5997493:3:::5719918:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::5450992:3:::5450992:3:::5840413:3:::5840413:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5816422:3:::6738963:3:::6738963:3:::6657747:3:::5439461:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::21963:4:::6723034:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6757811:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6789555:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego City 5613: Firefighter::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::25.02.2010::::     have this mini fireman and his equipment amongst our box of toys related to people who help us. This Lego mini figure fireman is quite cute. He has on his fireman s uniform with a hardhat. His legs move, his arms move, his head turns. He has those Lego claw like hands which can hold his equipment. If your Lego house or car has a fire then he is the man to help you. Included in this set are 25 pieces some are quite small so not suitable for a child under 3 in fact this set more suitable for a 5-12 year old ,4 years old would be fine if supervised and not a child who puts things in his mouth. With the fireman comes some fire. This is orange flame shaped plastic inserted in a single pip brick and a small circular stand. This fire brick can be inserted into a Lego house or other building if your4 child wishes. There is a tool rack to make with a few Lego bricks. This will hold the fireman s equipment which is 2 saws, a fire extinguisher and an axe. There is a fire hydrant too this is made out of a few bricks too. I do not think there is a hose. But we have a different fire Lego set which has a hose so that s ok. This fireman and his equipment will add an extra dimension to your Childs Lego building play, your child will use their fine motor skills to put the pieces together and use the fireman and tools in pretend play to put out fires to rescue Lego people from car accidents. I love to listen to the children while they play this Lego set will add more scope for their language development. We use this set when talking about people who help us. We also have a fire engine. Children learn through play and this is a good toy that will help teach them about firemen and their work. This fireman is not too expensive from http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=5613 LangId=20 57 ShipTo=UK he is reduced from    2.46 to    1.22. On Amazon you can buy him from 45p but with shipping this makes him more expensive than some other vendors. You should be able to get this figure for about a fiver with packaging, or you might get him in a toy shop for about    2.50. Would I recommend? Yes      ::::5646482:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5522492:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::21963:4:::6723034:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6755322:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5021331:4:::5021331:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6710719:4:::5816422:4:::3957:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Learning Resources Let's Pretend Toaster::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::24.02.2010::::    What does teddy want for breakfast this morning a slice of toast Dolly? Well then let   s make some pretend toast with the Lets pretend toaster from learning resources.  I am sure this toaster is in quite a lot of early year   s settings and a few homes too.This toaster is a 2 slice toaster/2 slots. It is a bright yellow coloured plastic. The toaster is about 5    /12, 7 cm tall. This is a good size well proportioned for little hands. It has a weighted blue base on the front of the toaster is a red circular dial that is easy to turn. This has 7 settings (does Teddy like his toast well done Dolly?) Above the red dial are the words lets pretend in blue. There are two pieces of plastic bread to put in to the toaster. These pieces of bread are white and have a brown crust. There are also air holes molded into the bread so it does bear some resemblance to real bread. A red lever on the side of the toaster lowers the bread and when the times winds back to the beginning the bread pops up, just like a real toaster. The timer does make a noise ping quite loud. Your child can then take the    toast    out of the toaster and serve it to Teddy. I have had to pretend to eat many a slice of this toast too yummy yum it   s tasty  The dials on this toaster are simple and easy to use.  This toaster requires no batteries it is a mechanical toy. There is not a great deal that can go wrong with it. This is a robust toy should last several years many play hours. I know the one that I have used has been dropped many times and still ok. I would recommend this toy for a child aged 3 to 6 years old. All children love pretend house play cooking and giving treats to mummy daddy teacher or Dolly and Teddy. This toy has great educational potential in pretend play, role play sharing, interacting with others .it does provide another opportunity for using those fine motor skills. You can extend this play to talk about healthy eating. Offers the opportunity for language development talking about the toast.This toaster can be bought for    9.87 from http://www.auravita.com. It is often bought as part of a pretend play kitchen set . Would I recommend? Yes this is a good basic pretend toaster ideal for both   early years    centres and home.     ::::5719918:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6625623:3:::6625623:3:::5439461:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::6740155:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6739162:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6657747:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6710719:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6808065:4:::6808065:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6824143:4:::5021331:4:::5021331:4:::5816422:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Picture Pairs::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.02.2010::::     This Picture pairs is another game from the early learning centre that I and some children that I know play. This game is suitable for over 2 year olds. I think that 2 may be a little young but certainly by 3 they are well into it.  These cards will be suitable up to the age of about 6 years old. The cards that come in this bright orange box are made of a fairly strong square card. The ELC says forest friendly but I am not sure what that means. There are 54 cards in this box. Each picture is on 2 cards so there are 27 pairs of pictures. The pictures are of things a child should recognise such as a car, a ball, an apple, a teddy, flowers or a clock.  On each card there is a single picture image. These images are strong and colourful. They are easily identified. These cards are ideal for playing snap, pairs or a memory game, (the one where you place the cards face down and take turns to turn them over remembering where they are to get a pair.  There are many other games you can play too, be inventive make up your own. With a younger child you do not need to use all of the cards at once just use a few and increase the number as your child becomes more able. This cards are good for early language development too  tell your child the name of the object on the card you can talk about the picture too , how many spots has the lady bird how many eyes has teddy has he got ears. These cards help your child develop their problem solving skills and their social skills. Learning how to take turns and play with others. This set of cards cost    6.00 at the early learning centre on or off line .

       " '5247778::::BHS Snow White & Cinderella Reversible Dressing Up Costume::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::22.02.2010::::    So who is she going to be today? Snow white or Cinderella... .The costume my granddaughter has costs    22 pounds from BHS. I think my daughter told me she bought hers from eBay. It is available in 3 sizes, 3-4 yrs, 5-6 years and 7-8 years. This outfit is very pretty made from polyester. It is a waisted dress with short puff sleeves. It  s length on my granddaughter below knees but not on the floor. One side of the reversible dress has a pale blue skirt. The bodice of the pale blue skirt is blue too . The bodice has a pale blue bolero over an even lighter almost white bodice and puffed sleeves. There are lace and ribbon trims on both sides. Turn the dress inside out and the reverse skirt is yellow with a light blue bodice and puff sleeves this has a darker blue bolero with red criss cross ribbons. With this dress comes a hair band too. My Granddaughter is like all other children and loves to dress up she loves to prance and dance about in this dress , She wears it here on visits and has  worn it to a party  .When I took her to Tesco s shopping she has even wore it there. When my granddaughter is playing dress up and she gets fed up with being  snow white all she has to do is take her dress of turn it inside out and become CinderellaThis dress fits fairly well and seems to be made fairly well.  It is only sponge clean, however my daughter has washed it on a very delicate wash and it seems to have survived. One word of warning keep your princess away from fires while wearing this dress its floaty skirt might catch fire it is flammable  All children love to dress up this dress is so pretty it makes my granddaughter feel proud and confident. In it she conforms to being a princess pretending   to be royalty.  This is a good costume for pretend play. Wish they made dresses like this when I was little I would have loved one. Do I recommend?

       " '5247778::::Brio 33563 Wooden Railway System: Semaphore::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.02.2010::::    Today we are playing with our Brio train set, track laid out bridges made scenery arranged trains at the ready choo, choo choo and of we go. One of the children has put a semaphore signal here by the side little Johnny has changed the signal so Jane s train has to stop. Let s look at the signal. This signal has a sturdy square base 3.75 cm. This base is wooden. From the centre of the base stands a yellow plastic pole 9 cm tall. There is a little yellow lever half way up the post that controls the signal manually. There is a red plastic signal at the top. So little Johnny has moved the signal with his fingers and says Stop to Jane, he will not let Jane move her train till he has changed the signal. This little signal adds more play opportunities to the brio train set. Children can pretend they are fixing the track and the signal needed to stop the trains, they can use the signal to stop the wooden brio trains for any reason they make up. This is a good addition teaching children about looking for signals and what they mean, teaching children stop and go. The mechanism of this signal is simple children just need a pincher finger grip to change it. This semaphore signal should costs under    5.

       " '5247778::::Great Gizmos Wooden Shape Stacker::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::20.02.2010::::    Shape stacker. This is a wooden toy pegboard toy. There is a flat wooden square measuring 15c by 15c which has little pegs about 4cm tall sticking up from it. In one quarter of the board there is only 1 peg in the next quarter 2 then next quarter has 3 pegs the last the forth quarter has 4 pegs sticking up from it . There are 16 colourfull wooden geometrical shapes that will fit onto these pegs. There are 4 of each of the following shapes circles squares, triangles, rectangles  each shape has I of each of these colours the colours red yellow blue green. The circles have one central hole to fit on the quarter of the board with one peg. The rectangles have two holes which fit on the area with two pegs. The triangles have 3 holes to fit on the quarter of the board with 3 holes; the square shapes have 4 holes which fit on the 4 pegs in the last quarter of the board. This toy is well made very strong, will last a long time many play hours. The base a natural wood colour the shapes are dyed /stained not painted. This toy is suitable for children aged one and upwards. It is age appropriate for both the younger children and the 18 year old special needs students that I have used it with.This is a good developmental toy for sorting and stacking, putting the correct shape onto the right number of pegs. This toy teaches shape, colour and counting. Will help practice and perfect those fine motor skills. Do remember to talk to your child while sitting alongside them while they are doing this puzzle say the correct shape names the correct colour and count the shapes too. Your child will learn the correct words for them by copying you. Until you know someone with poor motor skills you really do not realize how important they are. Gaining the ability to button your own clothes, do up zips, shoelaces. I think this is a good toy for a nursery or school at home too for learning shape colour and using those fingers for practicing those fine motor skills . This toy is not too expensive at    6.99 from http://www.mulberrybush.co.uk/toy-store/detail-geo-stack-board-2008.aspx .

So there are 20 pictures with words at the bottomEach card features a picture of something spelt with 3 letters on both sides of the card. These have a coloured strip under the picture with the name of the object on it.  To avoid confusion one side of the card as a red strip the other a blue strip. Each piece has a piece of the picture and 1 letter on it.The images are real photos; some of the items pictured are Dog, cat, bed, hat, car, and egg. I can not remember the others. The pictures are colour and easy to identify. Your child does not have to know his/her letters to put them together. These cards will familiarise children with the letters and children will be able to pick up how to read and spell these words. While your child is doing these puzzles they are practising their fine motor skills.  Name the objects and the words as your child is doing these puzzles.

The tunnel is not painted it has no decoration to make it appear to be made of stone of have tees growing around it.This tunnel adds play opportunities to the train lay out and adds extra fun. Your child can put this tunnel to go through a n open ended box which he/she can decorate to make scenery for his/her brio train track two tunnels can be joined together to make a really long tunnel . This tunnel piece of train track has a conjoining jigsaw like piece at each end, one male one female this pieces are easy to fit to other brio train track.

This 10 piece transport puzzle is suitable for a child aged 3 although I think a slightly younger able child will be able to cope with it. This puzzle measures 300ml x 200ml.  The wooden tray is a natural wood colour. . It has the individual transport pieces cut out of it.   There are 10 puzzle pieces.  There are 2 cars, 2 motorcycles, a bicycle, an ambulance, a bus, a lorry, a taxi, and a group of people waiting at a pedestrian crossing. The puzzle pieces are coloured and easily recognizable. These individual pieces each have a little peg attached to them.  I like peg puzzles for little children. They are easy to do.This 10 piece puzzle needs a little more thought than the puzzles with fewer pieces. The shapes are quite distinctive. This puzzle will help your child develop their spatial awareness and their fine motor control. This puzzle is quite interesting to a young child they like to see cars and busses. This puzzle could be used as part of a transport project at   nursery, or home. Use it to develop your Childs language learning the words, names for the different transport pieces. Puzzles are good for your child. Have a quiet time in your day sit at the table with your child and a few puzzles. Puzzles help your child develop their concentration skills, learning how to sit and work. Your child may only be able to sit for a few minutes and do only a few pieces of puzzle choose a simpler puzzle and slowly build up the difficulty of puzzles and the time they sit and    work    Childs play is their work learning about the world and how to do things.

       " '5247778::::Tobar Make Your Own Friendship Bracelets::::Family::::40::::helpful::::17.02.2010::::    This is a craft kit to make friendship bracelets. I recognise it as one my daughter had in her early teens. In this kit from Tobar are 10 packs of coloured threads like an embroidery thread. There are 2 pattern wheels and some instructions. There is enough thread to make ten bracelets in 4 different designs. Making a bracelet is a bit like plaiting and weaving using the wheel is good as it keeps the threads in the correct position and untangled. This makes pretty bracelets and once your child gets the hang of how to make them you can get more threads and different colours to make more pretty woven bracelets. I think this craft set ideal for a child aged about 8 upwards. When my daughter had this I could not resist using it and I enjoyed making some bracelets it was a satisfying activity. It would be a great stocking filler. You can make these bracelets for yourself or a friend. According to Native American tradition these woven bracelets should be worn by the recipients until they fall apart, otherwise it shows a break in friendship with the giver. You can buy this friendship bracelet craft kit from Amazon for    4.75 or from http://mwstore.co.uk for    2.99. You may be able to buy it at craft shops in the high street too.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Pony Ranch 4187: Donkey with Foal::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::17.02.2010::::    Have you a horse mad child? Then they might like this Playmobil girl with donkey and foal. This toy suitable for a child ages over 4 years old . This pack of Playmobil toys includes a girl with short blond hair a striped jumper, red trousers and green wellies. She has a Donkey and a foal to look after. The donkey is grey has sticky up ears it is wearing a bridle with a rope attached. The rope can be held in the girl s playmobil gripping hands. This Donkey can move its head up and down so it could be drinking water or eating hay. The foal a smaller animal also has a moving head and neck, it has no bridle. There is a red bucket that the girl can hold by the handle my children pretend to give the donkey and foal water from the bucket. With the set comes a small plastic hillock with a tree on it. The tree has 2 masses of green leaves which fit to the branches. This sets the scene for play. There are a few flowers under the tree. Put the set on a green cloth and you can pretend they are in a field. There is no saddle for the girl so she can not easily ride the donkey. This set would go well with the Playmobil farm/ranch, or the girl could take the animals to the vets. This toy promotes a love of animals and their care. I love to watch and listen as the children play. You can use this toy to talk about horse. How many legs good for learning language the mane of the horse, colour identification.

       " '5247778::::Chad Valley Farm Animals Wooden Jigsaw Set::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::16.02.2010::::    This looks like a pretty good price this set of 3 puzzles for    9.99p from Argos These Chad valley puzzles are ones I have used at work and know they are good ones. If you are buying a present for a child ages 1     2 years old I would recommend these. I work with special needs children and they are ideal for us. These puzzles great for home or any child play/care /schoolThese 3 wooden puzzles are tray puzzles with inset pieces each one has a different number of insets. I have not got one at home to measure but I guestimate the length of a puzzle is about 4o cm the width slightly shorter. They are all the same size. These puzzles are well made ours at school are quite old and well used. *Let me describe the simplest one. A coloured background picture of water lapping at a sandy beach backed by green trees and forest topped with a blue sky with clouds. In this scene there are 5 animal cut out jigsaw [pieces. These pieces do not have pegs. Tip the puzzle over and the pieces will fall out or you can remove the pieces with your fingers. To help you find the right place to put the animals back in position there are the same pictures printed in the empty hole. These animals are fairly easy to fiddle round and fit your 1 year old will need help your 2 year old should be able to do it on their own with a little practice *Next the number puzzle has 9 pieces. These pieces fit onto a plain wooden surround no picture. The pieces are numbers 1-9. Each number well drawn and has a design on it each number a different pattern there are stripes or, spots plain or patterns each one a different colour. Now tip these pieces out or remove them with your finger, the pieces stand slightly proud of the flat tray. Although the numbers clearly drawn and the pieces shaped they are not completely shaped like the number. I think the big jigs number puzzle has the pieces cut out as the individual number.On the base of the board where the number puzzle pieces fit are pictures that correspond to the number. These are fairly easy to place into the holes a bit of shuffling about needed the number of pictures a hint to the child where the pieces go. A 2 year old  will be  just be able to sort out where to put the pieces  with trial and error by 3 they should be able to do this easily . This is a good puzzle for early number recognition and counting skills.* Now the hardest puzzle. This has 26 pieces each a letter of the alphabet this like the number puzzle has a plain wooden back ground. The pieces are smaller than the number pieces but otherwise are similar. The alphabet pieces are patterned and coloured. The spaces where they fit white with an image of something simple that begins with that letter. This puzzle is good for letter and sound recognition a 3 to 4 year old should find this puzzle easy to do and it will be a help to their early reading skills.*About these puzzles collectively This is a good set of puzzles good for practicing fine motor skills and hand eye coordination. Good puzzles to use to support those early   literacy and numeral skills. There is a lot to talk about with these puzzles so good for language development.  I have watched and supported children doing these puzzles and know they like doing them. While supporting a child doing these puzzles I will ask them about the numbers or the letters the animals names the colours or the patterns. Give the child the name of the puzzle piece if they do not know it. Some of the alphabet shapes will fit in the wrong alphabet space as the shapes are similar they do not fit exact but to a child they are a good enough fit Would I recommend? Yes I think these are good wooden puzzles that will last a long time and are educational.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5719918:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6757811:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::21963:4:::6735325:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6723034:4:::6410840:4:::6421517:4:::6421517:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6750576:4:::5203100:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6378505:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6811202:4:::6811202:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It has a carbon steel head. This is good as it resists scratches and rust A brass ferrule (circular metal fastening) for strength. A 5 inch /126mm long weatherproofed hardwood handle for durability.It has a handy leather strap on the handle to hang it up with I was in my garden transplanting some runner beans at the weekend this was the tool I used. It was easy to dig a little hole into my soil and then use the transplanting trowel to lift the runner bean seeds from their pot and position them to growing position. I also used it to thin out my lettuce. The narrow blade worked the soil around the root balls easily giving little damage.I have used this Spear and Jackson transplanting trowel when I have needed to dig just a little soil. I used it when getting my seeds trays ready and I also use it when weeding around my veg. It   s handy as it has only the thin blade that does not cause much soil disturbance.

       " '5247778::::Batchelors Slim a Soup Chicken Noodle and Vegetable::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::14.02.2010::::    I am not be the slim elegant person that you imagine me to be, I have just a few extra pounds of weight here and there. I decided one way to cut a few calories in my diet was to eat/drink soups for my work lunch. Its winter and I like a soup to warm me up before ore going on playground duty. I sometimes take a tin of diet soup but get fed up with waiting for the microwave to be to available to use. . I bought a pack of Batchelors chicken noodle and vegetable soup. These are available at all the major supermarkets and other shops too. I usually shop at Tesco where they cost 81p the same price as Asda and Ocado, Sainsbury s are selling them at    1.25p per pack but have them on a 3 for 2 offer makes then 13p cheaper for three packs. The box that holds the packets of soup contains 4 packs. The card box and paper envelope that holds the dried soup is not very interesting or inspiring. Gives you the info about the soup and directions of how to make. Basically there are 60 calories in a pack 1  fat. To make put the powder in mug or bowl add 190mls boiling water. I never measure at work, no time a mug full is about that though. Stir the  quot;soup quot; I usually add a splash of cold water to mine otherwise it s too hot to drink before work again. This soup smells a bit chicken. Looks a golden brown thin liquid it has a few green bits floating in it onion or chives I think and there are a few sweet corn kernels too as well as a few noodles. . I prefer to use a spoon to eat mine as it makes me think this is a meal not a drink. You can glug it straight from your mug though. The smell is lightly chicken. Now onto the taste ..... A very light mild taste yes its chicken I think I can taste the light onion /chive flavour. Unless I leave my soup for a while before I eat the sweet corn the kernels are a bit hard. This soup does not satisfy me at school lunchtimes so I need my slice of toast with it and finish off with some fruit that I eat on the way back to the classroom no time to sit-down to eat the fruit. This soup is ok if you just remember it is a diet soup not a big meal soup. I shall probable try the other flavours as well. They are fairly cheap lunch at 21p each and they do not have many calories so maybe I shall soon be that slender elegant person It might work as Long as I remember not to eat the birthday cake/biscuits that are often on the staffroom table.      ::::5719918:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6754091:3:::6754091:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::21963:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6723034:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6735325:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6755322:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6750576:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I had some from a packet of these at a meeting the other day. These shortcake biscuits are available in a 2 (individual biscuits) or a 6 pack. The 6 pack is made up of 3, 2 packs. I have seen and bought these occasionally at train stations and airports. These biscuits are sometimes in vending machines and often on sale at snack counters or in newsagents . The 6 pack is available in Tesco s, at    1.09 Sainsburies selling slightly cheaper at    1.06. I think they are expensive for what they are. These biscuits are presented in a flat yellow wrapper with Cadbury shortcake SNACK written on. The biscuits inside are small square chocolate covered biscuits the thin chocolate slightly crinkly. Each one weighs 20g. Bite inside and you have a shortbread biscuit a couple of bites and its finished. These biscuits taste ok that s all just ok . These are so- so biscuits , The chocolate , what there is, is pleasant enough it s a cadbury milk chocolate. The size of these is snack too little snack it will not appease hunger. These contain Wheat Flour, Milk, Whey   Soya Lecithins May contain Nut s, so not ideal for many allergy sufferers. There are 55 calories in each biscuit so would not be the end of your diet if you had one to eat.

We have this set of shoes at work and I am sure other preschools and early years play facilities have them too .Lucky girls will have a set just like this at home. This pack of 6 pairs of shoes comes from Argos they cost    9.99p. These shoes are suitable for a child aged 3 years old and over. They are a size 12.1/2 I have seen 3/4/5 year olds wearing them at school. I am not sure how they are packaged ours at work are quite old and we store them in a plastic box in the house corner. Included in this set of shoes is a pair of pink ballet shoes. The other shoes all have a small heel and open backs and toes. There is a white pair with a flower and jewel stuck on it. (Ideal for the wedding). A red pair with a ribbon rosette, a purple pair with a cream bow and another purple pair with glittery upper, then an orange red pair with concentric circles patterning. So a pair for every occasion. The soles of these shoes have no grip but they do have a little black rubbery disc on them which does help give some grip. These shoes are fairly easy to slip onto little feet and my girls do seem to be able to trip trap and totter a little around the classroom in them. The ballet shoes and wedding shoes most popular. These shoes are quite well made ours have lasted a long time have been around a couple of years at least. Yes I would recommend this little dressing up shoes for home or school. I have fond memories of trip trapping around in my mothers heeled shoes no play shoes for me in the 50 s. Children love to pretend to be grown up wear clothes just like mummy     ::::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6410840:3:::6796382:3:::6796382:3:::5306962:3:::5306962:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5719918:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6737129:3:::6737129:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5816422:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6750576:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::21963:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6824023:4:::6824023:4:::6723034:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5203100:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

They cost 93p from Tesco. These whirls are quite attractive they are circular look like the biscuit dough was squirted onto a baking tray from a nozzle like a big icing one. . Possibly the name came from the skirts a dancer would wear while dancing and whirling in Vienna. Looks like a ladies skirt whirling. These biscuits are quite fat. Each Viennese whirl consists of 2 shortbread biscuits and these are sandwiched together with a small blob of raspberry jam and some butter cream. The top of the whirl is lightly dusted with icing sugar, These biscuits do taste nice the shortbread a good although not the best one. They are a little crumbly, quite dry. I ate mine over a plate. 1 of these was a nice sweet treat before I went back to the classroom These biscuit contain Milk, Wheat   Gluten and although do not contain nuts can not be guaranteed nut free. There are 165 kcal per serving. Looking at the Mr Kipling whirls in Tesco I see there are there are 143 kcal per serving These Tesco Viennese whirls cost 93p Mr Kipling cost    1.30p. I have had the Mr Kipling ones in the past and I think these Tesco ones are about as good as them.

       " '5247778::::Endura MT500 OVERSHOES::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::09.02.2010::::    Endura MT500 overshoeIf you cycle for pleasure or out of necessity then there will come a day when your feet get soaked and, as a result, cold. That   s where these overshoes come into their own. While they will not always keep your feet perfectly dry they will keep them warm.Formed from stretchy, windproof and waterproof material and with reflective trim for added safety, they are designed to fit quite snugly over cycling shoes and if you cycle in trainers you might need to buy a larger size than you would anticipate. Worth saying that road racers will want even more snug fitting designs to cut drag. These shoes are intended for mountain bike and cross country riding.The design allows the cleats of cycling shoes (metal parts that fit like a key into a lock on the pedal) and the tread under the shoe, to protrude and engage. This inevitably leaves a hole through which water WILL enter the overshoe if you stand in, or ride through, a puddle.However, most of the water will stay outside.   There are two problems with this shoe and the 1st fault is shared by many other overshoes: the holes under the shoe are surrounded by an elastic hem and this will eventually catch on the bottom of the shoe/pedal/rough ground and tear. Some designs of pedal eat the overshoe bottom very quickly so you might want to change the pedals if you currently ride on    spiky    flats.The second fault seems to extend to many Endura products; zips that pull apart when you try to pull them up. A year to 18months life is about average for these zips; though by then the elastic hem is probably frayed anyway. Some folks find that the zips break within a few uses.  A fault with certain competitors overshoes is that they are made of thinner material and the struggle to stretch them around the cycle shoe can tear the material. In balance, considering the merits and faults, these are worth the investment; relatively cheap (available from several sources for    20 (despite the RRP being higher); and they protect your more expensive cycling shoes, keep your feet warm (even if it is literally freezing) and, if you avoid paddling, dry.MT500 Overshoes: Black     Tough Nylon faced Neoprene    upper     Rear zip with snap-down puller and Velcro    heel tab to ensure snug fit     Moulded rubber toe cap with ridged/grooved underside to help when climbing steep and/or muddy slopes     Neoprene meets behind the zip to improve water tightness     Welded centre seam for smooth finish and improved water protection     Hard wearing Kevlar    faced base and Kevlar    stitching     Reflective logo and zip panels at rear Follow this link to Endura   s page for this Overshoehttp://www.endura.co.uk/Product.aspx?dept_id=107 prod_id=26.

       " '5247778::::Town and Country Childrens Wellies::::Sports & Outdoors::::40::::very helpful::::08.02.2010::::    I always have Wellington boots by my back door for the grandchildren to wear. We often go muddy places and do muddy things from here. I never buy new boots though I always look in the charity shop for them. I realized my grandson s were getting too small so have been looking out for a pair for several weeks. Last week I came across a pair in his size. These were a pair of Town and country childrens wellies. They cost me the princely sum of    3.00 now I usually pay less for their charity shop wellies, but these town and country ones are a very good pair. New the RRP is    12.99. The boots I bought were red but Town and country childrens wellies also come in blue or pink as well. Now these wellies come in a matching coloured nylon waterproof bag with cord draw strings. This is ideal for carrying , hanging on a peg or to put the boots in to keep the car boot clean. These boots available in size-3(31-36) The Wellington boots are made of natural rubber. I shall begin at the sole of the boot. The soles have a strong tread pattern to make good grip on the soil. These boots has a steel shank under the foot for additional support .The sole is cushioned so this will make the boots more comfortable, there is an innersole this helps keep feet warm. Grandson says  quot;yes nana they are comfortable quot;. The sole area of this boot is a darker red than the foot and the leg the blue one has a darker blue area the pink one a red darker sole area making the boots two tone. The seams of the boots are all fully welded. These boots fit my grandsons foot well they are not slim legged. To adjust the width slightly on the outer side of the calf there is a little strap of the darker colour on the sole. This when tightened does make the boot slightly narrower.The inner of the boot is lined . To top the boot of there is a thin reflective band around the top of the boots and a band of the darker red colour. These are quite attractive wellies and look well made should last many muddy puddle jumping s I have looked on line the price on most sites seems to be around    12.99 http://www.irishuk.com is selling them for this price postage paid.http://www.nextag.com has them for  42.50 *Extra info for you* The first Wellington boots were made of leather for Arthur Wellesley the first duke of Wellington in 1817. Rubber was first used in 1856. In the First World War. Wellington boots were the popular footwear in the muddy trenches. This info gleaned from several websites.

       " '5247778::::Running hamster in ball toy::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::06.02.2010::::    I have seen this little hamster running around at school. The children like to see him run around in his ball. This toy works for us in a special needs school as a toy which our less able pupils will watch and urn their heads to see. I think it would provide some fun for a normal child aged 3 or more. Not suitable for those aged under 3. Inside a clear plastic ball about 12 cm in diameter there is a life size toy hamster which runs on 1 AAA batter. The battery fit in under the tummy there is an on/off switch there too. The clear plastic ball comes in two just pull it apart when you want to take the hamster out ... I believe this hamster comes on a variety of colours white and sandy or sandy and white mixes ours is a sandy coloured one . The hamster has asoft plush coat. The hamster runs on small wheels and when inside the ball it makes the ball roll. Ours runs in straight lines I think there are other ones which run in other directions too. If you play with this on the floor its good, if you use it on a table just watch it does not run of the edge. This hamster is quite an amusing novelty I suspect it will not be very durable as when it  quot;runs quot; it knocks into or falls of things. My students do find it fun and I am sure it would confuse a dog or cat and drive them quite loopy.

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Farm Building Set 5488::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::05.02.2010::::    This is a great set of Duplo bricks for a child aged 2 years old and over. This farm set is a fairly new one only released last year I think. This Lego 5488 Duplo: Farm Building Set This set of 102 Duplo bricks comes in a rectangular green plastic box which is ideal for storing under the bed or in the base of a wardrobe. With this set of bricks you can make with your child a farm scene. Your child can have There are 11 colours of bricks in this set all the colours you will need to make the animals and farm equipment. There is a wheel base for a tractor and trailer. There are yellow fences top keep the animals in the field. There are a few flower heads; there are windows to make a farm building. Then there are those 4 or 8 stud bricks. There are curved sloped and straight sloped bricks. Then there are bricks with eyes. Pink bricks to make pig, white ones to make a horse-sheep or cow. Then there are 2 Duplo figures one girl one boy. They look just the sort of people to do farm work. A 2 year old may not be able to join the bricks together to build a construction but with encouragement and practice will soon be able to. My children are quite creative when making an animal, its best to ask what have you made in case you get it wrong. This set is great children will happily play with it for ages, and as we know play is the way children learn. While playing with this set of bricks your child is learning/practising fine motor skills. Learning how to construct and building about shapes and size... They are learning about colours are using their imagination. Lots of bricks in this set enough to share and play cooperatively with a friend. Your child will learn social skills how to share. This really is a good set of bricks. I love Duplo bricks they are made by a Danish firm that makes Lego. They were first made in 1969. Duplo bricks are larger Lego bricks twice the size of Lego bricks. These bricks are suitable for your child at two until about 5 or even older when they are able to construct with the smaller Lego bricks. These bricks can help your Childs language skills introduce the words for colour, number, higher and lower as you play with your child. These bricks can be used alongside Lego bricks in the transition stage some will actually fit together. Have fun playing with Duplo bricks I am sure your child will and they are so easy to clean too.

       " '5247778::::Tesco iced finger buns::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::04.02.2010::::    I am not sure why they were there but there were a few packets of Tesco iced finger buns on the table in the staff room .Since they were open I assumed they were for general consumption .(It is usual on a bday or other event to put cakes on the staff table for all to share .) Feeling in need of a sweet pick me up I helped myself to one out of a boring cellophane wrapper, there are 6 in a pack. I sat down with my cup of tea and begin to eat it. Now these fingers are about 4-inches/10-12 cm long I guessed. They are a white bready roll with white icing on top. They look only slightly browned a bit anaemic looking really. However I took a bite the bread soft very, very slightly sweet. It did not taste quite like a bread roll for sandwiches, but that might have been because I could not avoid getting some white icing in my bite too. The white icing almost completely covers the top of the bun roll. I took another bite; the icing is very, very, very sweet white icing no flavour other than sweet. I am not over keen on lots of icing so I sort of scrape the rest of the icing of the top with a knife. I finished this roll in another 3 bites so there are only 4 or 5 bites in one of these iced rolls depending on your bite size of course. I did not find these iced rolls very exciting or especially nice the sweet icing spoilt them the bread roll was a bit bland too really. It was fairly filling. However it suited my piggy desire for something sweet before I went back to supervise, the little darlings at play. These iced rolls are available from Tesco (it said Tesco on the wrapper) for the princely sum of 7op so I think for 11.7p a finger that s a fair price. Asda s equivalent cost the same too. They do contain 134kcal per iced finger bun, so I really should not have eaten it. Would I recommend? Well if you want a bland sweet fix these are fine, if you are a bit more discerning and like me do not like icing then do not bother with these even if they are stareing at you from the staffroom table.      ::::5717501:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6799546:3:::6799546:3:::6786736:3:::6786736:3:::6820455:3:::6474927:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5568585:4:::5568585:4:::6817427:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6822470:4:::6822470:4:::6723034:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6735325:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::6636249:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6776473:4:::6776473:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6378505:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6757811:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Chad Valley Alphabet Learning Frame::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.02.2010::::    This is a Chad valley Alphabet frame which I put out for the children to play with at school. This toy learning activity is suitable for a 3 year old and over. Basically this is a wooden abacus frame With two red wooden frame supports and 7 smooth dowelling rails The top rail is empty the lower 6 have 36 wooden squares that are attached to the doweling by a hole that goes through these wooden squares and the dowelling threaded through. 26 of these squares have the letters of the alphabet printed on them. The letters black and they are printed on a coloured surface red, green, orange, yellow or blue. The letters are small case. The opposite side to the letters are a natural wood colour and have a picture and a word printed on it that corresponds to the letter. For example the letter a, has an apple the letter z a zebra. The other blocks are number blocks up to 10 these are black numerals on a coloured background on the opposite side the word of the number is printed on the natural wood colour. My children just enjoy flicking these numbers and letters round and round. This toy is helping develop their hand eye coordination. The colours are attractive flicking round. While they are doing this they are looking at the shapes of the letters and the items representing them. Sitting alongside a child doing this I will point out and name the letters and numbers and talk about things beginning with that letter Some children will name a letter when they turn it over, will find the letter their name begins with. These colourful images will aid learning. My special needs children enjoy flicking the letters and numbers round. This toy is well made, a good quality wooden frame .lasts a long time.

I was surprised to find it still available. At http://www.kiddicare.com/ it costs    10.99p at Amazon it costs    7.00. OR  10.99. This toy is one of the Playmobil 123 series made for younger children it is suitable for children aged 3 and over Playmobil recommends .I think it would be fine for supervised play with a younger child. This safari truck is only small, seating for one play Mobil person only. This playmobil persons arms are molded they are not moveable. The head will move from side to side and the legs bend from the waist so he can either sit or stand. The figure from this set is in an orange safari hat and an orange waistcoat over an orange shirt. Certainly looks as if he is on safari. This set is a good size and easy for little hands to hold. This truck can be used as a stand alone toy or with other safari or zoo toys. Perhaps if your child has been watching a wildlife programs then the man on safari will have got the Rhino from the wild and be taking him to an animal rescue or zoo. If you have just visited a zoo then your child may be putting the Rhino in its cage The trick is white with black tiger stripes on an orange wheelbase. . Behind there driver is small flat area for 2 bales of animal food to fit. The animal food some sort of green oats comes in a flat plastic bale that neatly fits this area. The truck is pulling a trailer this trailer can be unhitched or hitched onto the safari truck. This white open trailer has 2 wheels .It has green plastic rails on the sides so that the Rhino can not get out of the tailor , There is a grey Rhino quite docile looking with two pointy ears 2 black dot eyes and a little black pointy horn. He just fits inside the truck. This is a good toy for your child to practise his/her fine motor skills pushing the truck putting the animal in and out of it. Good for his/her language too learning the name of the Rhino. Good for developing his/her pretend play. This little safari truck should last several years many play hours Children will still play with this playmobil truck up to 4 or 5 years or even older, use it as part of a zoo. Would I recommend?

The picture of a blue and orange lifeboat bobbing along on the sea, waves crashing against the bow. .A little orange rescue dingy is in the water too this has 3 people in i, two Lifeboat officers in uniform and a girl child between them. They are being watched by two lifeboat crew looking over the safety rails on board ship. You can see the lifebuoy strapped to the rails. This must be a big operation as there is a rescue helicopter in the sky as well as a nosey seagull. The lifeboat crew all look very friendly are wearing uniform and lifeseavers.The picture bright and attractive. The lifeboat is returning home after a successful operation. There is a lot to talk about in this puzzle. This puzzle is ideal for a safety topic or a seaside topic at school. Of course your child does not have to be doing a topic to enjoy making this puzzle.

This is one that can be used with older children as the picture is not too babyish. The puzzle pieces fit together with standard knobbly (male) and hole (female) cojoining system. There is only one fitting part on each side of a puzzle. This puzzle is in a treasonable card strong box, The cared pieces quite strong ours has been made many, many times , If it is like the other big puzzles we have that are a little older it will eventually show wear but the children not too fussy about the picture looking tatty or fade a bit .

       " '5247778::::Burnt Sugar Hot Ginger Crumbly Fudge::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::30.01.2010::::    Last night I ate the last piece of Burnt Sugar hot ginger fudge that I was given at Christmas. This fudge is so lovely I just had to tell you about it. The fudge came in a brown thick paper / box bag with a small clear window in it. This bag contains only 110g The fudge comes in chunks of different sizes, each piece a good size to put in your mouth. . It looks like it has been made in a tray then cut up in uneven sized chunks. It looks very home made. Opening the bag I smell a sweet smell. I put the piece of hot ginger fudge in my mouth the texture was grainy like the sugar that is used to make it the fudge very crumbly. The taste of this fudge is fantastic its amazing the sugar fudge sweet has an amazing hot ginger kick to it I love ginger . The spicy hot ginger flavour of this fudge from Burnt sugar is everything it should be. It really does look and taste as if it is home made. The ingredients are golden sugar, milk powder, salted butter, clotted cream treacle and ginger crush. There are 401 calories per 100g This really is one of the best, if not the best fudges that I have tasted. Burnt sugar fudges are available in waitrose and Sainsbury s as well as other outlets such as my local health food shop. Burnt sugar is a company started in Yorkshire 1999 Justine Cather. It has its roots in Lyme Regis where Justine s mother made fudge for her shop. This hot ginger fudge is hand made and has a fair trade certificate, they have also been certified a Carbon Zero company. I remember that this fudge was expensive on line the price    3.49 which is about the price that was paid for it in my local health food shop. You can buy it on line at http://www.guardianecostore.co.uk for this price or    19.89 for a case of 6 packs.      ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::6816400:3:::6816400:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5690767:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::21963:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6600809:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6755322:4:::6789555:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6723034:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6804632:4:::6804632:4:::5816422:4:::6781956:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6807698:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Chad Valley Magic Writer::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::29.01.2010::::    This is a magnetic drawing board from Chad valley that I have used. This toy is suitable for those over 3 years old. I think possibly a younger child will get fun out of it but do supervise them. This drawing board is made of a sturdy plastic. The drawing screen is framed by blue plastic and some green plastic inserts. There is a green handle on one side just right for a child s hand. A green pen tray holding 2 pens, a red one and a blue one is on one of the long sides. Another drawing stick pen is held on another side by a piece if thread. At the base is a slide which will clear the picture for the next painting. There are 3 yellow circular stamps with little peg handles, these fit into some molded shapes on the other side. The children I know love using these magnetic boards this one is most attractive as the drawing that appear on the board are coloured there are red, yellow blue and green, much more attractive than grey or black.  The stamps are a picture of a star, a heart and a car when the stamps are pushed down onto the magnetic sheet they make a coloured print they are small and easily recognised. They are easy to hold as there is a small peg handle to hold. The children I teach stamp these all over the drawing surface. The red coloured stick pen will also makes marks on the board your child can draw or write with this. Then there are the two pens these actually write colour into the drawing surface and everywhere else if you are not careful. These colours wipe of easily with a soapy water cloth. The pens work well the red and blue colours good *The picture can be erased easily for the next master piece. Often when I clear these away I erase the pictures by sliding across the orange/red button of the slider at the base. The screen becomes clear then for next time. Your child s masterpieces are only temporary, take photos if you want to keep a record of them. *This seems to be quite a durable toy although will mot last generations will last many play hours Drawing boards like this are super toys saves paper and they are fairly easy to put in a suitcase to take on holiday. Ideal for taking anywhere to amuse your child... These are good as they will encourage your child s artistic talent  Good for practicing that pincer grip and perfecting writing skills. Also great because they are not really messy. Would I recommend? Yes As with all magnetic toys make sure your child will not  quot;eat quot; the magnets as this can cause serious problems, should your child swallow any magnets then rush them to A E. Chad valley makes many toys they tend to be a cheaper make. These magnetic writing boards are available at http:// www.Argos for    9.99. They are available at several other outlets for about the same price.      ::::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::21963:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6410840:4:::6781956:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6800029:4:::6800029:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil 1 2 3 Family House::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::29.01.2010::::    This playmobil 123 house is a toy that I have played with alongside young children. I do not think it is available to buy new anymore, but I expect you might pick it up second hand in fairly good condition. For guidance the last new retail price I can find of this toy is    11.50. Playmobil toys are very durable and last many, many play hours and as such are suitable for both home and early years care facilities. This Playmobil house is a typical house shape. It is a yellow house with a red roof. There is a blue door set into a white porch there are some flowers growing in the window box below the window. This house is number 2 and has a mail box on the yellow wall, Above the door unit in the centre of the gable there is an upstairs window. Just inside this window is a small ledge which the cat that comes with the set can sit on. The chimney has a grey plume of smoke. If I remember correctly this bit is fitted in and often comes out when children play with the house so it may get lost. This house is not very big 26cm/10.in tall 20 cm/7.9in wide 12.4 cm 4.9in deep. The depth is just wide enough for it to stand up fairly well. Although the house has the front wall and 2 side walls there is not much space for rooms inside, just enough to stand the furniture that comes with it in a straight line. A freestanding blue kitchen unit with cooker and sink comes with the house. A yellow rectangular table and 2 red chairs also come with the set. There are also two play people figures a mother with cropped hair and wearing dungarees and a smaller child figure in purple trousers and blue top.T this figure looks more like a boy than a girl , but could also be used as a girl no problem. Playmobil figures are great the adult is 7cm /2     in tall the legs are fixed together but they can bend, sit, stand, turn its head, and move its arms. The hands, Are claw like and rotate these can carry any of the playmobil accessories. This house can be used with other Playmobil toys the Playmobil family with the pushchair could visit or The Plamobil car could be parked outside. This Playmobil house is a very simple basic house suitable for a child aged 18 months I think they would soon grow out of it as I said its very basic. One thing in its advantage is its not very big though as so many childrens toys are huge and can take over the whole house. Would I recommend? Well it s fine for an 18 month or 2 year old but not demanding enough on its own for a 3 and 4 year old. This toy will encourage pretend imaginative play and encourage your tot to use and practice their fine and gross motor skills.      ::::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::21963:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6739162:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6790268:4:::6790268:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::The Granary at Willow Brook Farm, Peterborough::::Travel::::40::::helpful::::28.01.2010::::    During October half term we were visiting mother in law in Peterborough and visited the Granary at willow Brook farm Helpston Heath. Willowbrook farm is still a working farm which has a farm shop and a small tea room and restaurant called the granary. The granary is only a small restaurant in the summer there are tables and chairs outside of the building too. . Sitting outside would be pleasant it is a fairly nice environment with animals in the surrounding field. In side is small but well laid out a pleasant surrounding. When we visited it was quiet but mother in law has been since and said it had got busier. The menu was not very large but the food was good. All day breakfasts were available and roast dinners I seem to remember lasagne on the menu, puddings included apple pie cream and ice cream there was a selection of home made cakes and scones. All the food was home made cooked on premises. The granary will cater for special events a hog roast available . We all had standard roast dinners with vegetables they were well cooked with fresh veg.Prices I did copy them down but have mislaid the scrap of paper. But I seem to remember the prices fair not over priced. The staff are very pleasant. We did not feel rushed but then it was not busy. The Granary is open from - 2.30pm   5.30pm - 9pm. Friday, Saturday   Sunday 12-9pm. If you are thinking of going do phone 01780 749483 to check times though as they may change. I do not remember that they had a drinks licence this may change of course. The coffee and tea we were served was good though. Helpston is about 10 minutes by car from Stamford 20 from Peterborough. The Granary a good place for stopping should you be exploring this area. There is a local nature reserve and its ideal cycling country. Helpston is the birth place of the Poet John Clare. Would I recommend? Yes we had a good meal in a pleasant surrounding.

       " '5247778::::Chad Valley Baby To Love Dolls Pushchair::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::28.01.2010::::    I work in a special needs school in a class of 5 and 6 years olds. About a term ago we bought a couple of Chad valley baby to love pushchairs from Argos for the classroom , well for outdoor play really . These pushchairs cost    5.99 you can see them in the Argos catalogue. http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3 844304/c_ 1/1 7Ccategory_root 7CToys+and+games 7C14417629.ht m. These pushchairs are not very tall handle height 56 cm I think they would be a good height for a 3, 4, 5 , 6 year old a 3 year old finding it maybe a ,little big a 6 year old may be finding it a little small . The pushchair is a perfect size for a 40 cm doll. The doll does not come with the pushchair but we bought the doll advertised on the same page and she fits perfectly. Our pushchair is a pretty pink it is a folding up type with Tubular steel folding frame. The handles are a hooked like a standard buggy pushchair and are pink plastic slightly padded. The wheels on the pushchair have a pink inner and a blue plastic tyre .The fabric of the seat is a nylon type is a pink colour sort of gingham  my check darker and lighter pink. There are some pink straps fitted into the pushchair for  quot;baby quot; doll to sit in. Our children love to play with this pushchair we bought 2 and they are played with everyday. I think they get used for at least     an hour every day. These pushchairs are pushed around the playground taking baby for a walk to the park or to see Nana alternatively sometimes the pushchairs get races around the playground at speed so these chairs do get a good workout. The pushchairs are fairly stable. The push chairs withstand the use they get so I think these pushchairs are well worth    5.99. To be honest our pushchairs often get used just to race around the playground but we do try to promote , doll play and some of the children do pretending to take baby for a walk and look after baby in the push chair. I think these are a good aid to imaginative play.      ::::5522492:3:::5816422:3:::5439461:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6794918:4:::6781956:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6723034:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Natural Coloured Glace Cherries::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.01.2010::::    OOHH LA LA, French glace cherries natural coloured from Tesco. I bought some of these dark red cherries in their 200g plastic see through pot to make some little cherry cakes for tea when my grandchildren were visiting. I remember when as a child I used to love cherry cake and picking the cherries out. The glace cherries I remember were always a bright shiny red, I do not think the natural coloured ones have been available till more recent years. These natural coloured cherries a much darker red than the red glace cherries I used to have. The colour still attractive and yes I did still eat one straight from the pot as I used to when I was a child. These cherries did not seem to be quite as sticky as I remember the non natural glace cherries being. I found these cherries tasty but although I had none on hand to compare I do not think they were quite as sweet as the bright red coloured ones. I found the texture good quite firm and leathery I could bite a cherry it was not mushy. To prevent my Tesco natural coloured cherries sinking to the bottom of my cake I chopped them in to 3 or 4 and then stirred them into some of the flour I had weighed out for the cake mix. . The recipe I use is a standard cake mix 4 ounces 125g self-raising flour 4 ounces 125g margarine 4 ounces 125g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 4 ounces 125 glace cherries. This mix makes pretty good little cakes. There are 325kcal in 100g of these cherries, hardly surprising really as glace cherries are made by boiling cherries in syrup to preserve them. These cherries cost me    1.19 in Tesco s they are cheaper than the Whitworths cherries. They are also cheaper than the bright red glace cherries from Tesco too. I will probably choose these to make my Christmas cake with.      ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::5577439:3:::6701923:3:::6396178:3:::6396178:3:::6750576:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6802223:4:::6802223:4:::21963:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5447660:4:::5447660:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6600809:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6723034:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6755322:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6776473:4:::6776473:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6410840:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6414449:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6474927:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6757811:4:::6820548:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6805406:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Fox's Ginger Crinkles::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::25.01.2010::::    I am reviewing Fox s Ginger crunch biscuit, try saying that in a hurry it s difficult. These biscuits come in a green packet, it has a picture of a couple of biscuits and the words Ginger crunch crinkles. There are 250g of biscuit there are 25 or 26 biscuits in a pack. Each biscuit is a round disc about     a cm thick and 6cms in diameter. They look quite attractive a golden brown the surface of the biscuit is crinkly and rough texture a sort of home baked look. They smell buttery and lightly gingery. These are not a soft biscuit but not as hard as some ginger nuts, you might get one or two crumbs but overall these are not a crumbly biscuit. These biscuits taste lovely, they go well with a cup of tea. The flavour of these biscuits is ginger not an overpowering ginger hit like some ginger biscuits but a lighter yet still discernable ginger flavour. They are made with crushed stem ginger. These biscuits are egg and milk free. There are 470 calories per 100g that s about 52 per biscuit also contain Wheat and gluten These are a satisfying biscuit a good flavour, a good size may be I will eat 2 but have no need for more in one sitting A packet of these biscuits will cost you 88p at Ocado. I think they are the same in Tesco s too . These biscuits are a good one if you like ginger then you will like these. Fox s is an old company founded in 1843 in Batley Yorkshire several generations after this Fox s are now part of the Northern dairies group. Fox s biscuits are a good brand I have always been satisfied after eating them      ::::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6396178:3:::6396178:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6820455:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::21963:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5577439:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5816422:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6758966:4:::6758966:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6657747:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

       " '5247778::::Chad Valley 104 Piece Play Food Set::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.01.2010::::    Are you feeling hungry dolly? Well don t worry there are 104 pieces of plastic food In the house corner  I am sure this Chad valley pack of play food is one a lot of children will play with in their early year s schools. I am sure this set has been available for several years now. This set of plastic food has been in a many of the classrooms that I have worked in. This set is suitable for a child aged 3 up- t5o about 5 or 6., I think a slightly younger child would be fine with them too just supervise and play with an under 3. The packaging, a cardboard box I believe has been disposed of and the food kept in a plastic storage box. If you have these you will find they get scattered all over the house so a box or tub to keep them in one place is a good idea. This play food is available from Argos for    9.99. I think that this price and the food represent good play value. Although these foods are not the real size they are a good size and scale for dolls food. Not all of this play food is plastic the boxes are a thin card. There are 12 of boxes containing the labelling is absent from boxes but milk, cereal, and popcorn is amongst them. I can not remember what the other boxes are .are no ingredients in the boxes and of course they are empty. The pictures on the boxes are realistic though although not branded. You can make out if they are cereal pop corn. These boxes being only made of card are the first to suffer damage. They would probably fare better in a home setting. I suggest stuffing the box with paper to make them more rigid. There are 3 plastic bottles 2 of them are tomato sauce ones tomato sauce ones and a corn oil one too. Also an empty salt and pepper shaker and some plastic chips. There are 2 pizza slices, sausages. 1 chicken leg, 1 burger slice of meat 2 shrimps. Ten bakery items that s croissants, rolls donuts and cakes biscuit. There are 2 ice creams and 2 cones, these have to be put together to make the complete ice cream and cone.. There are 8 cans of food which are beans peas, tomatoes, fruit cocktail, tins of sardines and such products. Then there are 13 fruits and vegetables apples oranges bananas, grapes, carrots, cucumber tomato and a lettuce leaf. To finish with there are 25 individual crispsand a piece of chocolate .. So Although it says 104 items of food it does not mean 104 different varieties , it means 104 individual items so all the slices of cucumber or all the individual crisps are counted not as one item but many . The plastic foods are quite durable they will wear, get squashed over time but seem to last well. This food will get dirty, everything apart from the card /paper boxes I have washed in hot soapy water. This set of plastic food holds great play potential. A play shop could be set up to sell the items. This activity good for both the maths money skills and the social skills of sharing and playing together also learning the social skills of shopping too, This food is also ideal for the home corner, for those budding chefs and parents to feed the doll family and their friend. This set is good for language development learning the words for items. Good for early maths counting and sorting. Excellent set for pretend, imaginary play I find it fascinating watching and listening to children playing with each other or their dolls with this food in the home corner. I know from listening to my own and now my grandchild how much they copy us grown ups; I know I can hear myself in the childrens voices Would I recommend? Yes if you have a 3 or 4 year olds birthday soon I think this would make an ideal present for    9.99 at Argos off or on line at http://www.argos.co.uk , If you want a smaller set there are some available too .      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6784650:4:::6784650:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6410840:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6750576:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6805797:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5439461:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5335750:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Games 3843 Ramses Pyramid::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.01.2010::::    My granddaughter was happily playing with the Playmobil vets surgery one side of the living room. My grandson erecting and playing with the Ramses pyramid from Lego games, this was the scene Christmas day at my house. The Ramses pyramid from Lego games was bought for about    20 by my daughter, it is available from for    19.99 at http://www.smythstoys.com it is    19.95 at http://www.johnlewis.com. Lego say this is suitable for an eight year old I would say that s about right. My grandson is 7     and could just about build and then play the game. It is getting easier for him the more he plays it. This game is suitable for 2-4 players First you build the structure then play the game. The pyramid structure was not too difficult to build if you followed the instructions. I helped my grandson build some of the layers. The pyramid was a grey and brown structure. Lego coloured gems are positioned at certain places around the pyramid. This game is suitable for 2-4 players in this Lego pack is 1 Lego board, 1 buildable Lego    Dice, 13 Lego micro figures, 1 rule booklet, and 1 building instruction booklet, Lego bricks, there are 214 pieces in this set. The idea is to stop the Mummy King Ramses from conquering all of Egypt with his army of mummies, to do this the dice is thrown and your player proceeds up the pyramid collecting as many gems as he can. You have to have certain coloured crystals to climb the pyramid. There are domes where crystals are hidden if you do not have the correct colour crystal check a dome, the dome can then be positioned. Mummies are positioned to stop your opponents path. The winner gets to the top and can throw the dice to claim win treasure. Full instructions are with the game. I quite enjoyed playing this with my grandson. It is not purely a game of chance some skill required not just strategy but memory too it s fairly crucial to remember which coloured gems are under which dome. This game should take 20-30 minutes Lego suggests but it took us about 50. Probably because we were inexperienced with it. Apparently my grandson has played it a few times since with his parents and they say it is getting quicker. So would I recommend? Yes I think so      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6723034:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::6750576:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6462984:4:::6462984:4:::5439461:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Wikki Stix Activity Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::20.01.2010::::    My granddaughter nearly 4 got a Wikki stix activity set for Christmas. So what are Wikki stix? Wikki stix are a modelling medium they are little bendy sticks like pipe cleaners but a bit thinner. These stix are sticky they are made from a string / yarn/wool that is covered in wax they come in 2 length   s 8 in/20 cm and 6in / 15 cm.  My granddaughter got a Wikki Stix Activity Set.* There are 84 individual Wikki stix some 8in/20cm some 6in/15cm.    There are 16 colours of Wikki stix a wide rainbow of colours reds, purples, blues, greens, yellows, brown.       This set includes a board for putting paper designs on and making the wikki stix design /model.      There are 8 paper pages with designs, ideas of what to make and pictures that you just place the wikki stix on. The pictures include a dinosaur a boat, and a dog. Just pull one of the Wikki sticks from the pack it feels revolting its sticky I dislike this feeling of sticky wax. When put onto the paper top make a line design they do not leave hands messy just feeling sticky. Just a quick wash and hands feeling fine again. These Wikki stix can be used to make tactile shapes and pictures. Wikki sticks do stick to paper and other materials. They are easy to remove and reuse. Wikki sticks can be used to make models just twist, bend and stick together. They can be stuck onto tin cans to decorate them, if you put one in the wrong place just remove and try again.Wikki stix are easy to use, fairly clean, easy to reuse, they do not crumble or dry out. *SafetyWikki stixs have no sharp edges they are made with non toxic wax no pea nut oil used the colourings food colourings.  Overall I think these are a good medelling art medium for children to use , however I dislike the feel of them .*This activity set costs    10 from Amazon  , small packs with just the sticky wikki stix in can be bought in packs with primary or neon colours for about    3.00 a small rainbnow Costs    1.50 from Amazon.

       " '5247778::::Tesco finest ginger cookies::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::18.01.2010::::    I am rather partial to a ginger biscuit and bought some Tesco finest ginger cookies. These cookies come sealed inside a packet in a rectangular card box These biscuits are a good size they are circular and look good. They are a golden brown colour with a cracked appearance. Sniffing them they smell biscuity and lightly of ginger. Biting into a biscuit is not hard these are not a very hard biscuit they are fairly soft and when in your mouth break into crumbs.  I am eating one now as I write this review and they taste lightly of ginger not overpowering. In each bite I get a soft piece of crystallised stem ginger This is pleasant, slightly chewy and does release a little more ginger flavour into my mouth.   These biscuits are good and satisfying one or two biscuits will suffice toll supper time. If you have a wheat allergy these contain wheat, I can not see that they contain egg or dairy products, but do check contents if you have allergies.  Although these biscuits have no nuts, they are made in a factory which uses nuts in other products. Mmmmmmmm yes I like these biscuits. They cost me    1.13 for this 200-g packet.I had better not eat too many as there are 125 cal per biscuit, 495 per 100g     ::::6731397:2:::6731397:2:::6396178:2:::6396178:2:::5439461:2:::6818430:2:::5522492:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6745054:3:::6745054:3:::5719918:3:::6758309:3:::6571275:3:::6571275:3:::5717501:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6145850:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::5816422:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6658557:3:::6658557:3:::6609678:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6496990:3:::6496990:3:::6816870:3:::6816870:3:::5687589:3:::5687589:3:::6337825:3:::6337825:3:::6657747:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6522551:3:::6522551:3:::6474927:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6755322:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6692844:4:::6378505:4:::6790827:4:::6781956:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6757811:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Alex Stamping Fun::::Family::::30::::helpful::::18.01.2010::::     I am going to tell you about Alex toys stamping fun. Sorry I can not find this on sale on the web in the UK I can find it on US sites for example http://gifts.barnesandnoble.com  16.95 and several other sites about the same price . I have seen and used this set at work so maybe it was available from educational suppliers.  However I have found stamp sets with dinosaurs on a UK site. These stamps come in a clear pack that   s good you can see the 18 stamps easily. Best if an adult opens the case its a bit fragile.  The stamps are varied cats dogs flowers, stars,  fish  a face  strawberry and bows .  These stamps are made of a dense thin foam one side is plain the other has the picture of the object in colour, ha There are 4 ink pads for you to put the ink or paint into.  All you have to do is press the shape into the ink pad and then press it on to paper . It does leave a fairly good imprint. However do not expect these stampers to be the best they are a bit thin and do not last very long, not the easiest to hold and print the picture without getting finger prints too. Much better to get a stamp with a peg or a handle. The stamps are fairly small about 2 cm -7 cm wide. Although they are suitable for a 4 year old I think that better for an older child who might be able to make them last longer by being more careful with them. I think that  the ELC stamper sets are better     ::::6731397:2:::6731397:2:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6790268:3:::6790268:3:::6716869:3:::6758309:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6415414:3:::6415414:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

My granddaughter loves Peppa pig along with many other 3 to 5 year olds.So what better as an incentive to sit and do puzzles than ones featuring her favourite character. These puzzles are recommended for a 3 year old my granddaughter nearly 4 has had these since last summer. There are 3 puzzles one with 6 pieces one with 9 and one with 12 pieces.  These are not large floor puzzles but small ones to do on the table. Each one although a different number of pieces is the same size. The individual puzzle pieces quite thin too .They is made of thin card which could get bent. While alright for home I think these would soon get bent and pictures damaged in a school / nursery setting. However these puzzles are enjoyed and played with. The pictures on the puzzle just like Peppa pig on TV or in her books. The 6 piece puzzle is Peppa at the school with Miss Rabbit. This is the easiest to do the pieces are largest and chunky .Then the 9 piece one in the playground with her friends and mummy and daddy. Then lastly the 12 piece with smallest pieces this scene is Peppa pig and family in the mother   s bedroom. This one is a bit more difficult.  This set is a good set with a progression of difficulty. Puzzles are great educationally. They are good for practicing and perfecting fine motor skills, good for size and shape recognition. They are good for developing your Childs concentration which is why Peppa pig puzzles are good because a Peppa pig fan will enjoy making it. A child gets a sencse of achievement and success when they complete the puzzle. You could always use this puzzle as a language tool, getting your child to talk about the puzzle and the picture.

       " '5247778::::Brio 30196 Crane & Loads::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::17.01.2010::::    I have played alongside children with this crane and loads by Brio .It is suitable for children aged 18 months and over. This red wooden crane with its Brio name printed on it is 7.5 x 14 x 17 cm. This is a good size for little hands.The red crane body has a small circular window and inside there is a small simply designed person.There are 4 wheels under the body of the cane Fitted to the top rear of this crane is a metal rod this goes completely through the vehicle. In the centre of this rod is a wheel with string wound round it the rod is quite long and can be turned to wind the string up. The string goes along the flexible arm of the crane and is attached to a magnet. This means anything the magnet picks up can be winched up in the air. The crane arm is fitted to the body by a metal pin so the arm can be raised and lowered. 3 small wooden magnetic blocks (they have magnetic metal inserted inside them) come with this. Paper clips set one has a picture of a car on it another a picture of a bicycle the thirds simply says BRIO. When your child places the magnet on the end of the crane it will fairly easily lift these blocks of wood. The crane will pick many other small steel objects too. I have picked up a very light toy car with it. This red wooden crane is an attractive toy.  Not only will it help a child   s motor skills by pushing it around and winding the winch up and down it will also help your child discover magnetic science. Children learn through play , we can help them learn by providing the right tools (toys ) and experiences. I do like this Brio crane.I like Brio wooden toys they are well made classic toys. Brio  has its roots in a firm first started in 18 84 by a Swedish basket maker. The trains which are perhaps the best known Brio toys were first produced in 1958 are the Brio wooden trains with which I have  spent many hours playing. Brio toys are all well made long lasting toys this crane no exception  The price of this toy is    19.90 from, http://www.cloudberryliving.co.uk. Its    20.99 at Amazon, at http://www.argos.co. it   s     17.59Although these magnets are firmly fitted do be careful.As with all magnet toys  make sure your child does not swallow magnets  should they then take child to A E  as magnets swallowed can be fatal      ::::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6790827:4:::6378505:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6818430:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5439461:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Magnetix I-Coaster::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::14.01.2010::::    This Magnetix iCoaster was my 7 year old grandsons Christmas present and we spent several hours playing with it over his Christmas over nights visit.First let me describe this toy. It is a construction kit to make a magnetic roller coaster.  A track of loops, slopes, jumps and drops. There are 15-millimeter metal balls which act as the carriages these are propelled along the tracks by magnetism.  This toy is made of metal and plastic. Not only is this a really super fast track for the magnetic balls to coast along there is a Sound FX and Music Studio,  This puts a soundtrack to the coaster. It features 4,000-plus distinct musical combinations. A MP3 player can also be plugged in to the coaster so your own music can be chosen. The music adds excitement to the toy watching the balls whizz round and jump to the music is compelling. The pieces included in this set are    17 Magnetix iCoaster tracks    6 stunt pieces    10 adjustable towers     2 light up sensors    Magnetic elevator    10 15-millimeter magnetic metallic rider balls    Sound FX Music Studio.*Christmas morning on my sitting room floor.Box of the new toy opened  There are instructions of 10 different ways to  fit the tracks of the roller coaster together to produce  thrilling roller coaster rides, Instructions read we fitted the tracks together this was not too difficult took a while  to work it out that   s part of the fun of the toy.. The tracks do have to be aligned correctly. This toy stayed erected on my sitting room floor for a couple of days, the design was fiddled with and changed. I am sure once this has been built and rebuilt several times it will be easier to fit together. I think that my grandson aged 6     is at the lowest age for this toy and that a child aged up to about 9 or even 10 will get pleasure from it . We did not plug in a music system or I player as we just used the sound tracks that came with the set. Magnetic balls released onto the track and off they went it was fascinating to watch these balls going round the track moving by magnetism watching the silver ball loop the loop and do jumps certainly my grandchildren were absorbed by its actions .Educational This toy promotes those fine motor skills and design skills. It also will let them see and realize the power of magnetism. Children will be fascinated by the movement and by enquiry and changing the track around develops their reasoning skills too.warnings This toy is unsuitable for under 6   s year olds and also those who put things in their mouths. This is because if the metal balls are swallowed they will link together and cause serious obstruction. If your eldest child has one of these do watch to see thier younger sibling does not eat the metal balls.  Be cautious if your child has friends over to play with this toy.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Vanilla Flavour Mini Rolls::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::14.01.2010::::    I am snowed in so I thought I would tell you about this value Tesco pack of 6 mini rolls. I have had these at home a couple of times and also at work (school) with the children. They really are quite cheap 30p for a pack of 6 so only 5p each roll  These cakes are presented in a clear cellophane bag on a clear plastic tray. The packaging is not exciting. The cakes are not individually wrapped. They look quite boring really a vanilla coloured cylindrical cake nothing to get excited about. These are mini Swiss rolls a plain cake with a vanilla buttery cream and red strawberry jam filling.Each cake about 6 or 7 cm long about 3 or 4cm in diameter. A good size really for a helping. So how do they taste? well they taste fine  the cake a standard  plain cake taste the filling well you can only just taste it.As you might expect they are a value cake and they are good enough for everyday and the children at work. These little cakes would be good in a trifle or you could decorate them with the children, a good snowy day activity if you have any.    Your child could use some ordinary or writing icing to decorate or stick iced shapes on them coat the cake with a little jam easy to stick shapes on then . After decorating your child can eat or save one for daddy when he gets home. These cakes do contain Milk, Wheat, Gluten, Egg   Soya have no nuts but cannot guarantee nut free.     ::::5522492:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6609678:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6791962:3:::6791962:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5816422:3:::6816400:3:::6816400:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5719918:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5447660:4:::5447660:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6757811:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5719974:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The Britain   s model is 1:32 scale and compatible with the other Britain   s 1:32 scale toys. Britain   s say this toy suitable for a 3 year old and over. While I agree its safe for a 3 year old and yes they can play with it I think it better suited to a slightly older child. This baler is a red one and has a front hitch so it can be attached to Britain   s tractors. It is very detailed with a rotating bale mechanism there is a ramp which will lower the bales onto the floor. The wheels of this toy are steerable.. It is a real look a like toy. This square baler comes with 3 green square bales. Green and golden square bales are available independently from Britain   s.This tot is great for    real    farm play or for displays.  Square bales are rapidly disappearing from our fields the farmer preferring the larger circular bales so soon children will not know what a real square bale is like . it is a rectangular bale really with square ends . Children will not be able to experience the fun I used to have  climbing on the bales and jumping from them , or using them like bricks and  making housed /dens  I regularly got shouted at by the farmer for doing this .I think this Britain   s square baler a good toy to add to a farm vehicle set it is realistic.

One of the sets we have is the tesco musical instrument set Catalogue number: 201-2509. I think this toy is available both on line and in larger tesco   s that sell toys. It costs    8.97. This set includes a drum with drumsticks, maracas, a tambourine, a xylophone and a clacker.The drum is yellow with one end red the other blue two yellow drumsticks are provided to hit the plastic skin at the end of the drum. Your child could play this with his hands of course or any other beater such as a wooden spoon or a plastic spatula.The maracas are a red plastic this had a raised design on it. The handle a shape that is easy for little hands to grasp. Although this maraca is quite strong and will take a lot of shaking if it is hit hard on the floor several times it may well break the plastic.The tambourine is not a circular one, the skin a semicircle if plastic held by a blue frame. There are a couple of chiming disks on the frame and there is a good handle formed into the blue plastic frame... The handle makes it easy for small children   s hands to hold and then tap a beat on the tambourine shaking it to make the disks chime.The xylophone is a small molded yellow frame with a molded handle. This xylophone is not very big a 5 year old will begin to find it   s a bit small for his hand.  Into this are set 3 keys red, green and orange. To make a musical note out of this either tap the keys with a finger or use the drum sticks or a spoon. This again is a small toy a 3 -4 year old would find it fine but by 5 -6 a child would find it a bit small.The clacker, a green handle with ridges to make for easy holding has 3 different coloured spoons like shaped clackers at the end this is clackers clack wellThis set is suitable for a child aged 18 months and over.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Animal Clinic::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::10.01.2010::::    I could not easily get to my computer work station on Christmas or boxing day   Why? well because the floor surrounding it was a vetinary playscene. My daughter had bought my granddaughter a Playmobil animal clinic and I had bought a few accessories too. Let me describe the scene on my carpet, after the Christmas wrapping and boxes had been rapidly destroyed. Sweet caring little 4 year old girl sat on the carpet. Floor almost completely covered with plastic, plastic animal s plastic people, plastic fences, plastic box s plastic walls. Big brother is playing with his toys at the other end of the room. The older generation talking, eating chocolates drinking wine, alternating between watching Christmas TV and interacting with the children. First space was cleared for the sweet little girl to put the animal clinic measuring 21 x 14 x 9 inches in position. This clinic has blue walls with an open back for easy access. It has black sloped pointed roof. There are opening yellow double doors and a gable window above these at the front of the building. . There is a sign saying CLINIC this was click fitted into position above the front door There are a couple of small animal cages fitted into the side wall. My grand daughter positioned the two  quot;operating quot;/examination tables into the clinic. Then we clicked and fitted an outside arched wall to the side of the clinic. This is a modern clinic so it has a computer too. There is a bird aviary blue roofed, yellow meshed walls with opening door that will click fit into place too. We just left the animal pen free standing. Then there are mesh walls which nave to be clicked together to make a couple of animal runs/pens. My granddaughter could click some of the pieces together but daddy had to help her by making most of them. Then there is a Playmobil tree. I put the leaves on that they are a bit fiddly for my 4 year old. My granddaughter arranged the buildings and clicked the parakeets on the perch and placed these in a cage. She then put the vet s instruments ready in the little blue boxes. She found the vet and the nurse and the Playmobil child .The vet then had to look at one of the 4 dogs in this toy set, the Playmobil child said (in a voice a bit like my granddaughters ) that the dog had cut his leg . Well the vet then with my granddaughter s voice spoke in a hushed caring voice and put a sticky reusable plaster on the dog s leg. She gave the dog an injection and some medicine. Then the vet proceeded to put a ready plaster cast ob the horses leg, apparently the horse had tried to jump a tall fence. For the next half hour the vet and the nurse treated the peacock and the 3 rabbits. They treated the cats. The vet listened to the animal s heart through the stethoscope that came with the set. There are plenty of animals the vet has plenty of healing tools and medicines for them. The additional sets that you can buy are not absolutely necessary. My daughter and son in law had bought this vets clinic for my granddaughter. Granddad and I bought the vets car, the cat tree and the vet s transport which is a cart and a few animals. These compliment this vets clinic well as do many of the other Play Mobil toys, no reason that the knight can not take his trusty steed to the vets or the king take the royal unicorn This Playmobil vet s clinic is suitable for children aged 4 year old and over some of the pieces are very small. It s suitable for solo play or a group of 2 or 3 children. I think that my grandchild will still ber playing with this when she is 7 or 8 years old . This toy is great Listening in to my granddaughters play a treat her sweet caring little voice talking to the animals and telling the owners to give the dog its medicine at nights. I could tell that she was the vet, maybe one day she really will be. Although she has no problem with her motor skills while playing with this toy she will be practising and using them. This Animal clinic s RRP is    51.99 but at http://www.kiddicare.com its    39.99. at http://www.toysdirect.com its    34.99 At http://www.amazon.co.uk its    39.00 at http://www.johnlewis.com its    39.99 at http://www.fatbraintoys.com its  64.99 This toy is very durable Playmobil toys last many play hours and usually still in good condition ideal for selling on or saving in the loft for the next generation. Playmobil has its beginnings in a metal lock company founded by A locksmith named Andreas Brandst   tter. In 1876 This German firm developed from making locks to making metal toys. In the 1950 s Plastic was used and a process to make the hula hoop designed. It was realized that the molding process to make hula hoops would suit other shapes and at the end of the 1950 s beginning of the 1960 s the first Playmobil toy, a car developed. Playmobil still owned by the Brandst   tter family has developed into an amazing toy educational, children love playing with it and its durable easy to clean. Playmobil toys suitable for home or early years educational establishments. This Playmobil animal clinic is a good toy after watching my granddaughter playing with it I can see that she will get hours of fun from it, expensive but worth it.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6818430:4:::5719918:4:::6807698:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6693128:4:::6145850:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6750576:4:::6410840:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6699566:4:::6474927:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6790827:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6816400:4:::6816400:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I think a green one is available too, perhaps its an American one. But I am familiar with the orange one . The bin man/garbage man wears a blue overall and has a white hard hat to wear. (Duplo is very health and safety conscious)  Your child aged over 2 years old can help him with the big grey shovel to clear up those rubbish Duplo bricks someone has left lying around , 4 ,4 stud bricks come with the set. These bricks can be either put directly into the open wagon or put into the green rubbish bin/can. The green bin will hook onto a black lever at the back of the rubbish truck your child can then raise this and the rubbish will fall into the truck. The truck is about 10cm /4 inches long 12 cm/5 inches tall 7 cm /3 inches wide. It is of course made of plastic. The vehicle has a cab where the bin man can sit and on top of the cab is a representation of lights so they can alert people when the lorry is going backwards (they don   t work)This is a good truck Children do like playing with it, clearing the carpet of Duplo rubbish.

They are ideal to use alongside other Lego kits useful as you might lose a brick from another set. . The boxes of specific designs only hold enough bricks for the model they make. This basic brick box is useful if you lose brick from a set.Lego bricks are a great conjoining brick suitable for a child aged 4 and over. A young child will enjoy these basic bricks by building them into towers  ,or walls  before they get involved in the more precise Lego constructions. Children can use their imagination more with this set than the kits for making individual constructions which have the designs and pictures printed on them. These basic Lego bricks can also be used with the Duplo larger bricks,  Duplo twice the length, height and width of traditional Lego bricks, Lego bricks are fantastic they last well and are a good tough plastic washable when they get dirty. The colours take a long time to fade. This box of bricks is suitable for home or school although school will probably have a larger container of Lego bricks.These bricks are good for helping your child develop his/her fine motor and construction skills. They can be used to help colour recognition, language development. They are ideal for early math   s too basic counting, addition and subtraction. Lego bricks are made by a Danish company which evolved from a carpenter  Ole Kirk Christiansen, who in  1916,  had a woodworking shop making houses and furniture. He began producing toys in the 1930   s, in 1934 the company name Lego was used. The name Lego ideal as it   s  adaptation of the words that mean play well in Danish and Latin words that could be interpreted as  quot;I put together quot;  The company changed direction from wood working to making plastic toys, the first Lego brick designed in 1949 being called Automatic binding bricks. In 1953 they got the new name Lego bricks.  The Lego company is still a family business owned by the grandson of Ole Kirk Kristiansen It is possible to buy this from http://shop.lego.com  for    8.29 in fact trawling through the results from my search  you wont get this box much cheaper .

       " '5247778::::Tesco Chocolate Mini Rolls::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::08.01.2010::::    Tesco Chocolate Mini Rolls We had our school childrens Christmas party a few days before we broke up and parent s, carer   s and staff bought in nibbles cakes, crisps and such After the party we cleared up there was an amazing amount of food left .Some we saved for future use. Some the use by dates was very close that between us we took them home. I took home a packet of 12 Tesco chocolate rolls.  These are also available in a six pack.These 12 chocolate mini Swiss roll cake rolls are in a lilac /blue coloured plastic packet, so not to be confused with the Cadbury blue packaging. Each cake is individually wrapped in a light purple /lilac wrapper too. The individual wrapping is a good idea if you want to send your child in to school with a single roll in his /her lunch bag. The wrapping does also help keep the chocolate covering with the individual cake should the chocolate covering get broken. Tear open the plastic wrapper and we see a thinly chocolate covered roll. This roll about the same size as other mini cake roll that is about 7cm long 4 or 4 cm fat.The chocolate that this roll is covered in is milk chocolate, I take a bite of the end the chocolate tastes pleasant. IO look at the inside of my cake roll it is swirl of cake which has chocolate butter cream spread on the inside. I take another bite the cake is moist not crumbly. It tastes  slightly chocolaty quite pleasant , The butter cream filling is smooth and tastes slightly more chocolaty than the cake about 4 bites and I am  done, That was an ok cake perhaps not the best  but ok, not one I would turn my nose up at ., just as well there are 11 more in the pack. These chocolate cake rolls contain egg, milk wheat and gluten they have calories per cake, although they contain no nuts Tesco cannot guarantee they are nut free. In general, I would describe these cakes as so    so they tasted ok, not brilliant but not disgusting either.  These cakes ideal for a sweet treat in the school lunch pack occasionally. Fine for a childrens birthday party. Not suitable for that trifle though. These cakes cost    1.48 for the 12 pack that   s 12p each      ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6609678:3:::6816400:3:::6816400:3:::5719918:3:::6696039:3:::6696039:3:::6740155:3:::6559995:3:::6559995:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6399658:4:::6399658:4:::5719974:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6410840:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6735325:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6789555:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::21963:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5335750:4:::6816870:4:::6816870:4:::6378505:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5439461:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6806108:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 5633 Polar Zoo::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::06.01.2010::::    It   s the right season to be playing with this toy, the Duplo polar zoo 5633. One of the classes that I visit was playing with it before Christmas and talking about  animals and where they lived.I love Duplo bricks, there is such a huge range of bricks from the basic bricks to animals real people and fairy tale folk. This set would be suitable for over twos, I think that nearer three year olds will get more from it three and 4 year olds will use their imagination more and the animal pieces will begin to have more meaning for them. This Polar zoo set still suitable for 5 and 6 year olds for occasional play.Included in this pack are 2 penguins, 2 polar bears, a fish a zoo keeper. A yellow and blue short tube a red attachment, 2 pale blue 8 stud bricks and a thin grey 8 stud brick too make up a tube for the animals to slide down. There are enough standard Duplo bricks in white and blue to make a stand for the Duplo zoo keeper to use to feed the fish to the penguins.  There is a thin red brick and a couple of yellow gate bricks to help construct this stand. There is one angles concrete grey brick with a picture of a bear on it. Duplo suggest that this can be used with a couple of other bricks to make a stand for the bears to climb on. There are a few see through ice blue Duplo bricks to add some atmosphere to the set. The penguins are both good black and white shaped blocks with two holes for the Duplo studs to fit in at their base. The Bears are rather cute one baby, both white polar bears.  Their feet have those holes for the duplo studs to fit into. The fish is a good size and the part just below the tail will fit snugly into the zoo keepers claw like hand. This Polar zoo set would compliment the other Duplo zoo items .In total this set of Polar zoo has 32 bricks.   Children learn as they play, toys a child   s tools for learning. Duplo bricks are good they help develop fine motor control, hand eye co-ordination. They develop creativity and imaginary play. Can be use as a tool for early maths counting the animals , or bricks  can be used for developing language, the adult giving the correct word for the colours the animals you can sneak in a tall  short , high or low. Heating these words will soon familiarise your child with them and they will soon understand their meaning. You could go on to talk about animals and their homes these animals are in a zoo must be because the penguin lives at the South pole the polar bear the north. Penguins like the cold and would not survive the heat at the equator so have never crossed it to the North and just as well because the polar bear would eat them so best keep them separate in this zoo build a fence. Luckily it is too far for polar bears to swim from the Artic to the Antarctic.Duplo bricks are bright coloured plastic cojoining bricks twice the size of Lego. They are made by Lego a Danish firm. They were first made in 1969 after the popular Lego bricks which were first made in the 1930s. The firm had its roots in making wooden items including toys. The name Lego was introduced in 1934 an adaptation of the words that mean play well in Danish or an adaptation of the Latin to put together. By the 1950   s the bricks which were a forerunner to the modern Lego brick were made. Lego evolved from these and then the bigger Duplo for younger children. Duplo is a very long lasting toy I have some over 30 years old. They are easy to clean wash in warm water you could put them in a pillow case inside the washing machine for a good wash. Enjoy playing with your child and their Duplo bricks children soon grow up. The R R P of this toy is    17.99 at Amazon you save only a few pennies it is    17.49.

I shall describe the Brave prince from his boots upwards. His boots are bright blue into these go his legs clad in a pair of green trousers Then he wears a  blue jerkin to match his boots. A grey belt goes around his waist. Over the blue jerkin is a green tabard with cold edged castellation at the bottom edge. He wears some gold chain mail like a large collar around his neck. He wears his golden crown too.  There is a sword  and a  gold edged blue and yellow  shield with a crest on it, The brave prince holds these in his claw like hands. This brave prince looks sweet rather than brave His dresser  choose colours which do not go together really , still he could always push the babies pram or get married to the princess, If he is out at the same time as my granddaughters new vet set he could take a horse to the vet for a check up. This figure stands fairly well and is easy to change his arm and leg positions. both legs move together . If you want him in a permanent display blue tac his feet to the base then he won   t fall down This brave knight is suitable for a child over 3 years old I think my granddaughter got it for Christmas last year just before her 3rd birthday, or was it the year before?  Price well I can not remember what was paid for this toy and looking on the internet I note this brave prince is difficult to get in the UK. I think Playmobil has discontinued making him. You can get him from http://www.thechristmasplace.net for  3.19 . Its likely you will get this prince on eBay or in a charity shop , or maybe a shop that has old stock .     ::::6740155:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::5719918:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6805797:4:::6757811:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6292077:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6506577:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5816422:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil Roman Family::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::04.01.2010::::    I have had great trouble finding this roman family on the internet. The playmobil website http://www.playmobil.de/on/demandware.store/Sites-GB-Site/ sells them  here they cost    8 and I have found them available at http://www.utoypia.com for  10.99. I have found plenty of other Roman people available easily the warriors and chariot s and a roman arena. I have used these Playpeople when doing a topic on Romans with children, This Roman family includes a Roman Mum Dressed in a long yellow gown her arms move and her hands are those traditional play Mobil claw hands that can hold playmobil tools. Then there is Dad with his white tunic with gold embroidery worn over his blue top and trousers. Then the children a girl wearing a yellow skirt and top with a blue stones necklace she is smiling her arms move and her head will twist from side to side. Now the boy dressed in a white tunic. With this family comes a tall green Roman pot embellished with a coat of arms. A blue book, a white doll a sword and a shield too. The mum and dad are about 3 inches 7.5 cm tall the children a little shorter.I think this is an excellent group of people ideal for schools doing a Roman topic, or talking about families. Playmobil figures and toys are great. They are very durable lasting man, many play hours. They wash easily with hot soapy water. Playmobil figures were first made in 1974 by a German lock making firm that was changing to toy production.  I would recommend these Roman people for children aged over 4 years old up to the age of about 7. This Roman family is great your child can learn a little history while playing with their toys.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5690767:4:::6410840:4:::21963:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5439461:4:::6757811:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Bionicle 8693: Chirox::::Family::::30::::very helpful::::04.01.2010::::    Warning, warning my Grandson had the evil looking Lego bionicle Chirox and he likes to scare his Nana with it.  There are 49 pieces that make up this awesome winged fiend. Some of the pieces are quite small and fiddly they clip into each other.  This toy suitable for aged 7 and over I can imagine an older child having fun with it.  The pieces are very small so not good for a 3 year old and under. Chirox is tall and spindly he has feet with 2 claw like toes these are movable at the ankles, He has skinny bony legs in fact it looks a bit like a black skeleton. The legs fit into his hips. His shaped chest holds a red pod  inside the pod are  some leeches  When the Chirox is dropped on the floor and hits it in the right place the pod opens and the leeches fall out . There are long spindly arms attached to the body and these have hands which will hold the swords that come with the set .  There are wings these are shaped like sharp knife edges .They attach to the shoulders now these shoulders are impressive. The Chinox bionicle looks a bit bat like or like a flying ant. These wings can fold up and out again His head is a bobble, scull like fitted with an aerodynamic mask with air intake, equipped with a laser view/ When constructed this toy stands about 7 in 19 cm the wing span 4in 8cm wideOnce this toy was made I don   t think he came to pieces again. It can be remade again and again but my grandson has just left it ready made. My grandson enjoys flying this toy in his hand and trying to scare his mother, his sister and me. I do not know where this was bought as an uncle gave it to him but on Amazon you can get it for    4.99 with postage to add or    7.99p including postage. Would I recommend / Well not really  as I do not  like the kind of play this figure promotes , however to build this toy will  require  some skills practiced , This model stays together quite well and should last a few years I think .This Chinox looks quite evil and scary I hope I don   t meet him on a dark night. My grandson enjoys playing with it making it fly and scare people     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::6757811:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6805797:4:::6741170:4:::6741170:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5816422:4:::6752211:4:::5717149:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6699566:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6378505:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6636701:4:::6636701:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I bought mine on line with the Playmobil pet transport. The R.R.P is    7.99 but you can buy this on line from    5,99 at http://www.bumblekids.com  athttp://www.kiddicare.com its    6.49. This toy is suitable for a 4 year old it has small pieces which may be a choking hazard.Now I couldn   t resist opening and playing with this toy. It includes 2 Playmobil children a boy and a girl. The blond haired boy wearing blue trousers and a white top with blue stripes. The blond haired girl wears a red scarf on her head. She wears green shorts and a red top with flowers on it. Then there is this    tree    a yellow plastic pole with a little box at the base this has a hole so that the cats can be put in it. Then there are two platforms at the side of the    tree    these are big enough for the cats to sit on. There is a platform with an arc over it and  then another platform at the top of the    tree    There are 6 cats in this set two black ones two ginger cats and 2 white ones .  One cat of each colour is sitting one is standing. There is also a food/drink bowl and a plastic cat traveling box.I know my granddaughter and her play and I imagine she will enjoy making these cats climb the tree and sit on the platforms. I can see her making the cats eat or drink from the bowl, one cat will have to be put in the box. I can hear her talking for the play people, telling the cats off for climbing the tree, making the play people stroke the cats with their claw hands. My granddaughter is a caring soul she will love nurturing these cats. These cat   s people and accessories will compliment the other Playmobil toys my grandchildren have. Playmobil is well made and very durable easy to wash and care for should last many play hours.  I can t wait till christmas day to play with  this and mygrandaughter and all the other toys , :-) Update . My granddaughter was enchanting playing with her playmobil cat tree and the other vet  toys she was given she played solidly with them for nearly 2 hours Christmas day. You should have heard her talking to them telling them to    get down  to get in their basket     and talking for the cats     ohh can I get  up there , whats in here look I am really high    This toy with the other vet toys was a success .     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::6735325:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6750576:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6264172:4:::6739162:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6757811:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6805797:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6474927:4:::5790028:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6807698:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This bag is also an ideal size for carrying your school work in. An A 4 folder will fit snugly into it a small laptop probably would too. This rucksack is available in the colour pictured here also in black or blue I have a black one. This rucksack has two main compartments zipped at the top then a front zipped pocket this is zipped at the side. A mesh pocket on the front which closes with Velcro , this pocket big enough for an ordinance survey map. There are no side mesh pockets for drink bottles. There are a couple of loops attached at the sides and the one at the top. There is also a larger carry loop strap at the top too. When overloaded I have been known to attach small items like a torch to these loops This bag has 2 comfortable slightly padded shoulder straps I find the size of these pockets good. I carry food and drink in the pocket away from my maps and books. It is big enough for a packed lunch a drink , my waterproofs ,   map . My small camera fits fine when I am not using it.  This rucksack is just big enough for an overnighter bag carrying essentials tooth brush, spare undies clean shirt and a small sleeping bag will squash into it too.    This bag is very durable I have owned mine several years now it gets thrown in the back of cars it gets pit on the rocks and I sometimes have been known to sit on it or use it as a pillow. The stitching is strong. I find wearing and carrying this bag quite comfortable the shoulder straps are wide and padded.  The back of the bag is padded it also has an air mesh back which stops me getting too sweaty, when carrying it on a hot sunny day(oh I wish for a hot sunny summers day) . If I am carrying a heavy load there s a lightweight waist belt to even out the centre of gravity.

Staedtler are a good make of many pens and pencils. These jumbo markers are a thick, fairly short pen. Easy to grip. These jumbo markers come in a plastic wallet of 12. Colours red, yellow, dark blue, light blue, brown, orange, light green, dark green, purple, black, white,  pink. These are water based ink, which contain food colourings. The colours on paper are good strong ones.The nibs of these pens are good and sturdy children love stubbing pen nibs on the paper so the nib does disappear, but these nibs are quite strong These pens do stay useable if the lid is left of for a day or two. This is an advantage as the children often leave the tops off. all children and some adults will chew , and risk swallowing pen tops The cap on these pens has been designed with safety in mind they are ventilated this reduces danger of chocking if they are swallowed, all children and some adults will chew, and risk swallowing pen tops. I have yet to need to worry about anyone getting a pen lid stuck in their throat though so am not sure how safe this ventilation makes them, Yes children will draw on themselves and get pen marks on their clothes (and mine too). The marks left by these pens will wash out of most fabrics not leaving any stain.   I think these jumbo pens good ones.

This box of puzzles would be ideal in a house with a couple of children aged 3 -6 year old. Or it is a good one to have in an early year   s educational setting. This cardboard box has 6 puzzles in each with a different number of pieces . One puzzle with Winnie and tigger on it has 4 pieces. Another puzzle with Winnie, Piglet, and Tigger ice skating has 6 pieces. The 9 piece puzzle has Pooh and Piglet chasing a butterfly. The 12 piece puzzle has Tigger and piglet with Pooh. Then there is a 16 piece puzzle of the friends with Tigger stuck in the tree. Lastly the sixth puzzle a 20  piece one-piece one  with the friends having a birthday party with Pooh opening presents and balloons in the air. So maybe this puzzle more suited as a birthday gift rather than a Christmas gift. There are several other sets of Winnie the Pooh puzzles from ravensburger with differing amounts of puzzles and differing designs. The puzzles in this box of 6 are bright and colourful the pieces are fairly small not over sized puzzle pieces. If you needed to you could wipe the surfaces over with a damp cloth to remove marks. Each puzzle comes made flat in a plastic bag It is a good idea to keep the puzzles separate in a bag with a tie or they get muddled. This bumper  pack of puzzles will help your child develop their fine motor skills and their spatial awareness, will help them develop their concentration skills.

She is only 1 year younger than me, but at 54 Miffy is still portrayed as a girl child rabbit of 4 years old or as a baby rabbit. I really like Miffy books Miffy is a simple design of a rabbit and you can buy Miffy on many children   s items plates, bedding, stationary and purses and bags. This little purse with Miffy on is one I recognise I think it has been available for several years now. You can buy this purse through http://www.amazon.co.uk or http://www.kapowgifts.co.uk . This sweet purse will cost    2.99 at both places. This purse is a circular purse is 3.5 inches or 9cm in diameter. This Miffy purse is Pink a pretty girly pink. One of the circular faces is a plain pink suedette fabric, on the other circular face there is a picture of Miffy   s face with her long ears and pin point eyes and nose. There are several pink and white flowers with 5 petals these are embroidered on to the soft suedette fabric that is used to make the purse. A darkk pink piping goes around the circumference of the purse where it fixes to the gusset.

Corgi makes realistic toy models of all makes of cars. One of these toys is a black taxi an Lti Black London Taxi. It is very realistic looking . This is a dye cast metal car. It has opening rear doors and fold down seat. It also has a wheelchair ramp. I like this as it help   s children who are wheelchair users relate to the toys, have a toy like something they would use. This taxi can be played with as a toy or used in a model maker   s scene requiring a taxi. It is suitable for a child aged 3 or over.This toy could be used in play therapy to prepare a child for a journey in a black taxi.This toy is good for helping a child develop their motor skills, their tracking skills and helps develop their imaginary play. Corgi model toy cars are well made and last years and years. To buy at http://www.corgi.co.uk this taxi will cost    6.99 , at Amazon I noted they were    6,98Would I recommend this toy? Well you know your childrens likes and dislikes.  This is good model toy taxi.  A 3 year old would get more fun out of a different toy car but for an older child this would be ideal for a more realistic car.       ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5719918:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5720245:4:::5720245:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6693128:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 5486 Basic Bricks::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::30.12.2009::::    There are 91 Lego Duplo pieces in this box of bricks.  This brick set numbered 5486 R.R.P IS    15.65.91 bricks is a good number for a starter set, however for a starter set I think I would prefer to buy one in a plastic    bucket    or box. Although this set of bricks is in a very strong card box which if the adult is the one doing the  getting out and putting away is fine and should stay in good condition, a child will eventually break the flaps and the sides of the box down.  The box measures 38 x 26 x 13 cm and weighs 450 g.  This box has a plastic carry handle so easy for your child to carry.If you have a lot of Duplo Lego I suggest a large plastic storage box an ideal container.However this box of bricks contains a good selection of bricks. The bricks are a good assortment of 7 colours. red, yellow, dark blue, light blue, some transparent blue too, dark green, light green. Some of the yellow 4 stud bricks have big black and white eyes imprinted on them. The shapes of bricks included in this set are standard 4 stud bricks and 8 stud bricks. There are some thin 8 stud bricks too. This set includes some bricks which have a slope on them the base 4 stud the top 2 stud. There are some bricks with a curved side too.  Then there are a few blue or green on stud flower shape bricks in this box. There are no bricks with wheels for making cars. With so many bricks your child will be able to make many creations.Duplo bricks are ideal for a child aged 18 months and older up to about 5 years olds.. Your older child will be able to use them alongside the smaller Lego bricks in the transition stage as they are compatible to some degree. The Duplo bricks are twice the size of Lego bricksI think Lego Duplo the best cojoining  brick  they are bright , attractive colours very, very durable  they will last many play hours ideal for a school or for home as I have said in my previous reviews my daughters children play with my daughters bricks from over 30 years ago, so second hand ones should be absolutely fine . Duplo bricks are made of plastic so will wash well in warm soapy water I have used disinfection on some in the past . Also they wash fine in the washing machine inside a bag , I suggest a pillow case . These Duplo bricks are a great educational toy. Your baby will be practicing their motor skills, they will be experiencing different colour s and beginning to learn the names of the colour   s. Your child can sort the bricks into different colour sets. Can build towers and count them. These bricks are great to pattern placing one colour after another then repeating the pattern. There are some eyes in this set so your child can use their imagination and make a person or animal. Sit along side your child play with their Duplo bricks , talk to your child help develop their language skills words for colour   s and numbers words like tall , high , low small , big . By doing this you really are helping their early foundations for math s language. Building with Duplo bricks will also help your child developing their concentration skills help them to learn to sit down and do a task. There is enough Duplo bricks in this box 5486 for your child top either play with on their own or with one or two other children, playing with others is good they will learn interpersonal social skills learning about sharing. At the age of 1    - 2 your child will be happy to play alongside another around 3 this changes and by the age of 4   they will be able to join in together to make a building together.

       " '5247778::::Rub a Dub Dub Draw in the Bath Crayons::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::30.12.2009::::    My grandchildren often have a bath at my house either on a sleepover or if they are late going home as they fall asleep in the car and my daughter just lifts them from car into their beds . So I have a variety of bath toys around my bath.My grandchildren have drawn all over themselves the bath and tile surround   Do I mind? No in fact I encouraged them.  My grandchildren used Cuckoo Alex Rub A Dub Draw In The Tub Crayons. These came in a box of 6 crayons, red, orange, yellow, green. blue and   purple. With them came a small yellow duck shaped sponge. I believe you can buy the crayons in a pack without the duck sponge. The colours are good bright ones. My grandchildren enjoyed colouring themselves and making many pictures around the bath. These crayons were easy to use. They wet the crayon and sketched away. The colour applied to skin easily and painlessly. A after the children had finished decorating themselves they reluctantly washed the colours of their skin I switched the shower attachment on and the colours came of with a little help from duck sponge. Before the children were released from the bath they enjoyed cleaning their art work off the tiles and bath.After the children were dry and downstairs I quickly rinsed and removed the remaining coloured marks from the bath area with a cleaning cloth. The marks did come of fairly easily leaving no staining. These crayons are easily removed from non porous surfaces but I am not so sure if they are so easy to remove from a porous surface so I would not encourage my grandchildren to draw on one. These crayons lasted several bathing sessions before being worn down to nothing . Would I recommend ? Yes.  They are suitable for over 2   s I can not remember where I bought these as it was a long time ago but it was in a high street shop. Online you can buy them from http://www.amazon.co.uk for    5.49p http://www.playmerrily.co.uk sells them for    6.     ::::5522492:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6752211:4:::6815459:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6292077:4:::6264172:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6735325:4:::6804117:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5439461:4:::6378505:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Basic Bricks - Deluxe 6176::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::29.12.2009::::    This box of Duplo bricks is a really good basic box of bricks ideal for a starter set. I was asking my niece about toys for her baby and she said she would like some basic Duplo bricks.  This boxed set of 80 bricks contains simply that. No funny shaped bricks, none with eyes, none with wheels, just 4 and 8 stud /pip bricks. There are a few of the thinner bricks too. The bricks in this box are a range of colours red, light and dark green, blue, yellow, white, orange, and black,   there are clear see through light blue bricks too. These Duplo bricks are ideal for a child aged 18 months and over up to the age of about 5 or 6 perhaps not to buy for a 5 or 6 year old as they will soon grow out of them. A 5 /6 year old will happily play with Duplo bricks often alongside his/her normal Lego bricks.   As I said this is really a good selection of Duplo bricks, your 18 month old may not be able to conjoin the studs together easily on his own but soon will.  Your tiny tot will soon be building towers and walls out off these bricks, while playing alongside you can be a bit more creative, build a house, a duck, a tree use your imagination. Your 3- 4 year old will be using their imagination too and be able to build recognisable things.Duplo bricks are great for early language and maths skills, learning to count as they build a tall tower comparing tall towers to short towers of bricks. Sorting and naming the coloured bricks. Making patters by making a tower, or a line of bricks. One red, one blue, one green, one yellow then repeating the pattern. I think Duplo bricks are a great toy for children. I have bought many sets for friends and my own children.  I have also played alongside many children with Duplo bricks as I have worked in early years education for many years. I think this is as I said a great basic set that can be added too buying cars or set   s with the animal s in.Lego is a well established Danish toy and Duplo has been made since 1969. Duplo bricks are twice the size of standard Lego ones.  Duplo Bricks are very, very durable my grandchildren play with their 32 year old mothers old bricks and some of those were second hand to her. Duplo bricks wash easily just need a wash in warm soapy water and apparently they will wash in the washing machine for a more thorough wash just put them in a net or a pillow case. I would suggest after getting these in a card box you buy a big plastic tub/box to keep them in. Yes I most defiantly would recommend this Duplo  Box of basic bricks 6176. I have seen this advertised for    19.99 at  http://shop.lego.com or     15.95 at http://www.supertoys.co.uk/    Amazingly for these bricks  at Amazon I note someone is asking    32.95         ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::21963:4:::6145850:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6789555:4:::5567145:4:::5203100:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6757811:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6410840:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6784650:4:::6784650:4:::5816422:4:::5719918:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6264172:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6750576:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I think a toy farm is an excellent toy for children.  Included in this set of farm animals from Pintoy are 2 cows, 2 pigs. 2 lambs,  2 ducks and 2 chickens. These little animals are made of Rubber wood which is harvested from a replenishable forest. These animals are fair representative shapes of real animals but not as good as some other the animals that I have seen . The cows for example  have a   thick rectangular flat sided body the head is rounded though. The other animals although not really realistic you can tell what they are. The shapes of these animals are chunky easy to hold and play with. They all have eyes, noses, or beaks and smiling mouths look friendly. These animals are all coloured the colours you might expect those animals to be. These animals are durable last for many play hours. They are suitable for children aged over 3 years old. These animals are good for promoting imaginary play especially when used along side a farm or other farming toys. There are 2 of each animal so good for Noah   s arc too. Good for using in foundation early maths find the animals that are the same, count them. Encourage your child to tidy them away at the end of the play session, if your child learns to put things away from an early age then it will not be so hard later .these Pintoy farm animals are available from http://www.woodentoystore.co.uk for    15.95p or    14.99 from http://www.anaratoys.co.uk they are    13.80 from http://www.the-imagination-station.co.uk I have put not recomended at the bottom but they are not bad , just  I think there are better ones available     ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::6735325:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::6786123:3:::6786123:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6750576:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::21963:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6723034:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6145850:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6264172:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5439461:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6757811:4:::5717149:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

So some money exchanged hands and I became the proud owner. There are several character options sets of the mystery crew with figures of the 5 characters. Scooby, Velma, Daphne, Fred and Shaggy, each one is slightly different either their clothes or expressions. The Mystery crew are wearing slightly different clothing. I have not easily been able to find the set of the mystery crew that my grandson now owns but the one pictured here at dooyoo is available for    19.99 on Amazon. These 5 figures measure between 3 and 5 inches tall. These figures are posable they will stay in the same position till you change their pose. My daughter made a chocolate cake decorated it with white chocolate buttons to be a path made a few gravestones out of iced half finger biscuits, scattered a few iced flowers around and placed Scooby and shaggy walking along the path. It made a fantastic cake,Sine then my grandson has played with all the figures. .Each figure will twist its head and arms 360 degrees thier legs twist backwards and forwards so my grandson can make them walk. Velma   s wrists twist round so her hand moves, the other characters can bend their elbows and knees. My daughter found the characters easy to stand Scooby and Shaggy s feet just in the icing they stand fairly well on a flat surface Fred stands well too. Velma and Daphne keep falling over I think it   s because their feet are small. My daughter arranged the other characters by the other food plates.As I said the character set I have slightly different from the one in the picture.*Scooby. In the Ghost patrol set My grandson has Scooby the brown Great Dane has black spots wears his turquoise blue collar and there is a little lever that you can lift to  give him a    fright    face by his eyes and tongue popping up .* Daphne,She wears a purple top a green skirt purple tights and green shoes. She can be posed ready for action *Fred He stands tall, dark blue shoes, dark blue trousers, short sleeved light blue shirt over a white long sleeved top, his red neckerchief around his neck Shaggy in his black shoes green t-shirt again over a white longer sleeve shirt He sports a beard in this model. * Velma The shorter stocky character, she wears her red shoes, orange knee high socks pink /red skirt wearing her glasses she looks smart.These character option figures are exactly like the characters on TV and in books, They are easy to move /pose my grandson is having fun solving his own mysteries with them. They made ideal cake toppers.  This set would be fine as my grandson has it as a stand alone toy or it would be great to add to the other Scooby Doo toys that are available. At work we have the dream machine so when my grandson grows out of this Mystery crew I shall donate it to school. This set is quite durable the limbs well fitted.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6145850:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5719918:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6807698:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6729329:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6749875:4:::5690767:4:::5439461:4:::6378505:4:::6410840:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Come Along, Daisy! - Jane Simmons::::Books::::40::::very helpful::::24.12.2009::::    Just recently at school we have been reading Come along Daisy by Jane Simmons. The children I was reading this with really enjoyed this book. I was reading from a big book so the whole class could see easily. The illustrations in this book are great. I think it   s possible that the illustrations were originally done in oil. The pictures are soft yet lively. Daisy Duck is a bright yellow and has a bright orange beak her feet are huge. Daisy is a really appealing character. The scenes and other animals that she is painted with are superbly done. Jane Simmons the author did the illustrations too.This book Come along Daisy is the first in a series of books. Daisy and mamma duck are swimming on a pond. Daisy is told    You must stay close    by Mama Duck but          .    Daisy gets distracted by dragonflies, Come on Daisy says Mama Duck Turn the page and Daisy gets distracted again She gets distracted by , fish and frogs  Daisy is having a great time on the lily pads watching the frogs    bong plop    of the lily pads and say    ribbit    Mamma duck keeps having to repeat    Come on Daisy    All of a sudden Daisy finds herself alone she is a bit scared ,  she hears noises , a bird shrieks from the sky , the reeds move , then relief when the reeds part and it is mama duck come back to find Daisy and says    Come along Daisy    Daisy although playing with butterflies stays close to her mother then . This is a great story for 3 to 5/6 year olds. The art work is outstanding. When reading to the class the children would repeat those words    Come on Daisy   . This book is great to read to children also the words simple enough for a child starting to read, the story is told with just that little suspense but not enough to frighten.This book is a good warning to young children to    stay close    when out shopping or walking. How many times do we tell our children to    stay close   . This book has 32 pages, its published by Orchard.This book is available in a board book form as a paperback and as hard back, it is available as a large book. I just checked on line and it is available at many online book shops, off line ones too I would imagine. On Amazon the paperback version of this book R. R. P    5.99 is available for     3.97 several more, cheaper and lots of used ones too. The paperback measures 26 x 23.4 x 0.6 cms. Would I recomend ?

At one end of the    body    there is a head this is half of a round wooden ball that has eyes nose and mouth on it. The caterpillar also has antennae. On the rest of the caterpillar shaped puzzle there are 4 different shaped pegs, one in each circular body part. One wooden peg shaped like a triangle the next a heart then a star then a pentagon.  Then there are 10 round wooden pieces about     a cm thick. These are brightly coloured some with a design on such as spots or stripes. The centre of these pieces is cut out to match the shapes of the pegs,  there are 2 each of every shape. These pieces are quite easy to fit when your child finds the corresponding shaped peg and wooden shapes. This toy is attractive children like it and its happy smiling face.This toy is suitable for a child aged 18 months and over,  a child up to about three will benefit from this toy .I think that for a gift for an 18 month to just over 2 years old this would be good. This toy would also be good for an older special needs child does not look too babyish. This caterpillar shape sorter is good for hand eye control and for fine motor control. Some of my students need an interesting attractive toy to encourage them to practice moving their limbs.This toy will also help with shape recognition and if you do it alongside your child do talk to your child use the shape names soon your child will recognise shapes and use thier proper names. You could also use this toy for early numeracy count the wooden circular pieces  oh yes colour recognition too name the colours talk about stripes and spots . While your child is having fun playing he / she is also learning. This toy is a good one, it is long lasting, well made as well as fun.

There are 325 kcal per 100gThis flour costs 43p for 1.5 kg this is the same prices as the cheap Asda or Sainsbury flour too. This flour comes in an uninspiring bag a white bag with the blue Tesco colour flashes top and bottom, then the words in Red. Still who wants to pay for pretty packaging on a bag of flour? I do not. Opening this paper bag is easy just undo the sealed top. Smelling the flour well it does not smell of much. What does it look like? Well it   s a white fine powder be careful you don   t spill any it will   look like white dust over everything. Young spooks may have used this flour to throw everywhere at Halloween, please don   t its messy difficult to brush it all up.Ok so what shall we bake with this flour? Bread ? - NO,  pastry ?-  NO.  You need plain flour for those. Lets bake a cake, no not a Christmas cake, my daughter is baking mine this year.I often make little cakes /buns for the grandchildren at the weekend when they visit, its easy to vary the sort of cake that way as one does not like this one the other. So I weigh out about 113g (4oz) marge  113g sugar 113g Tesco SR flour and have 2 eggs ready I mix  the  marge and sugar add the egg , beat well then spoon the flour in. Its not really lumpy but I could use a sieve if I wanted the flour fine, I fold in the flour and depending on what I have in the cupboard I divide the mix up into smaller bowls off chocolate powder to one (just a spoonful) I might add pink colouring to another small amount , maybe add some cherries or sultanas, maybe add grated orange peel to another or perhaps half a teaspoon of ginger one of my grandkids loves ginger.  I put spoonfuls of the mix into little cake cases in my little bun tins. I bake in a n oven about 170c for 15 , or 20 minutes. These little cakes are scrummy eaten warm, fine cold ..  For Christmas I shall bake some mine meat cakes same recipe as above but add a few dessert spoons full of mince meat to the mix these are super as an alternative to mince pies.I could use plain flour and add a raising agent such as baking powder but self raising flour already has a raising agent in it.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::22279:4:::22279:4:::5249006:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6744289:4:::6744289:4:::6784650:4:::6784650:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6609678:4:::6410840:4:::21963:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5816422:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6805797:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::6757811:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

There are 20 pieces to this train. The numbers on this train go up to number 10. The train engine a single straight sided piece is number 0. Each of the other numbers pieces of the train puzzle is two pieces coloured carriage with wheels on each piece has a number on it this number is displayed in a white shape. The joining edge of this piece is wavy not male and female joining pieces. The puzzle piece that fits on top of the number carriage carries the load for that carriage these are animals, the number of which corresponds to the carriage number so number 1 for example has 1 giraffe this is on a white background.    These puzzle pieces are easy to put together good for those with poor manipulative skills. However because of the straight sides your child can easily put the numbers in the wrong order. I think this is quite a good first number puzzle the pictures simple and bright, the pieces easy to fit. . Your child will be practicing their fine motor skills as well as learning their numbers from this puzzle. You will probably have to help your tot get the numbers and pictures in order to begin with. Spend time pointing at the numbers saying them and also counting the animals to help your child get the correct on in position.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Animal Clinic Playset: Pet Transport::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::19.12.2009::::    I have just received the Playmobil toys that I ordered for my granddaughters Christmas present, she can   t read yet so I feel pretty safe writing a review about them. The first pack I shall tell you about today is the Pet transport. This set   s RRP is    5.99. So as you can guess it is only a small set. Included in this animal transport is Two Playmobil children one girl in a pretty dress with a sun hat on the boy has the number 4 on his t-shirt and is wearing a hat too. They have a little cart which is green with some chickens on it. There are 3 animals to, two brown rabbits and a hedgehog.  There is a little plastic box, just the right size for the small rabbits to sit in. There is a little bowl to give the animals water in too.Now this set is rather cute. My granddaughter likes animals and shares ownership of rabbits with her brother. I have watched and listened to her playing with and talking to other Playmobil people and animals so I am sure she will get a lot of pleasure from this toy. The play people included and her other play people will be able to push the little cart assisted by her as their little claw hands will hold the handle. My granddaughter will be able top put the pets in the trolley and wheel it to the vets or to their holiday home, in fact if my grandchildren had a real cart like this I am sure they would just love pushing the real animals around the garden in it. This Playmobil animal transport will go well with the Animal clinic hospital that I think my daughter is getting for her. It will also go well with many of the other Playmobil toys my grandchildren have.  This toy will encourage her imaginary play and her caring attitude. Playmobil is well made has a long life I am sure this will be in good condition to be passed on to other children after my granddaughter has grown out of it. This Animal transport is suitable for over 4 year olds , some of the pieces are quite small so could be swallowed so not ideal for some child that puts things in his /her mouth still.

       " '5247778::::Camping La Bessiere, Blesle::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::18.12.2009::::    Camping  quot;LA BESSIERE quot; BLESLE.This year we decided to go on a camping holiday in France. Our destination was Nant in the Midi-Pyr   n   es Aveyron region. Now it is a long journey by car from Calais  as Nant is 957km, 8.40,hours driving without stops, (Michelin route guide) so we decided to  break our journey and camp at Blessle in the Auvergne region for a couple of nights . Blessle according to Michelin is 776km and 7 hours 8 minutes drive from Calais. I booked our camping through the tourist office http://www.tourist-office.org/tourisme/france/auvergne/haute-loire/blesle.htm. This was because I did not trust the website of the campsite to be virus free.  I tried to phone the campsite but my French was not good enough to make myself understood. The campsite person only spoke French. However I found the lady  that I spoke to  at the touristoffice and then her response when I emailed her very  helpful .After arriving in Calais we trundled along the motorway stopping several times .We    turned of at junction 22 or 24of the A 75 on the road to Bessle.  The campsite was only 5 or 6 minutes from the A 75, just after  Le Babory-de-Blesle, We turned right up towards Blessle  leave the D8  just after this turn and turn left it is signposted to the campsite La Bessierre  a short distance along this road . I found the Michelin rou    finder very useful.Arriving at the campsite we went to the office, a small cabin that also had a few items for sale and information leaflets. . We were met by the same lady I spoke to on the telephone, she spoke no English. My French very poor I did manage to communicate who we were. We found her     welcome    not very friendly she was not helpful at all. However we were only staying 2 nights. She showed ups the place she had allocated for us to camp , it did not look a good spot so hubby said could he look around the site and find somewhere else we were told yes in a disgruntled way. Due to it being August the ground was sparsly grassed and looking a bit brown.  We found a much better position and erected our tent. The tent pegs went into the soil fairly easily and the ground fairly soft comfortable enough for us on our camping mats and sleeping bags.  There was plenty of space for our estate car and our 5 man tent with a porch and an area to sit outside and cook our meal on the camping gaz. Not a huge space but Adequate. There were few trees around the site so although some shade only a little We went on a tour of the small campsite there are only  42  pitches for tents or caravans.Sanitary block~~~The toilet/sanitary block was not far from the entrance /office We inspected the sanitary block a few toilets and showers very basic, clean, hot, functional but not luxurious . We had taken our own toilet paper which was just as well as none was available when we were there. Most were standard European sit down toilets but there were a couple of French squatter type toilets too. There were some sinks too for washing faces hands and teeth . Sinks were available for washing up cooking things too . Also for clothes washing there was a washing machine available. I did not use this as it was the beginning of the holiday and we were moving on .Items for sale.~~~~~ As I said earlier there were a few , very few food items for sale in the office and you could order bread or croissants  for the next day if you wished./ however we went well prepared I had our first nights meal with us  easy to cook cous cous and  some salad. Other facilities~~~~There was a large stone table with benches around it and a roof /canopy over it. I think there might have been an electric point here as I noted someone using their lap top there. I did not really investigate this table area as camped next to it we a group of about a dozen handicapped people with their helpers and they were using this for their meals and games so although if I had really wanted to use it I would have done but I did not want to intrude. This group of people had a caravan and a tent opposite up and it looked like this was a site they frequently used. There was a mixture of families and couples on this site not many teenagers so it did not get noisy and rowdy. A few people had there dogs with them as dogs are allowed on site We walked slightly up hill and found a flat mown grassy area with one football goal post. There was also a miniature golf pitch.  I think there are a few other games available too but we did not investigate and ask due to my French not being adequate and I doubted I would get a friendly helpful response. The campsite is next to the river l Alagnon so it would be easy to fish as some people were doing when we were there. There was a filed with longer grass and wild flowers mixed in it alongside this area. We walked on here looking at the insects and flowers. From the football pitch a footpath left for the town of Blessle. This took us between 20 and 30 minutes to walk slowly  .The foot path was  uphill most of the way, easy to find and  follow. There are a couple of hotels in Bessle and a boulangerie, no other shops as far as I could see. When we were there village was in fete we walked around a little, food was being sols and there were 2 live bands, however we were too tired to really participate. The village Of Blessle is attractive, one of the most beautiful villages of France . A Benedictine abbey was founded here in the 9C. Only the keep towers  and outer wall is still standing. There are other half timbered houses and carved door way   s  showing the villages medieval history . We walked around and found the buildings very attractive a lovely place we did not go into any buildings although some are open and one is a museum. If we are traveling this way again I would explore the town /village a bit more. The surrounding countryside is beautiful and we spent the day there walking and just absorbing the rocky hilly mountains. It was a good rest after our long journey.See  http://daily.webshots.com/signup?TI=hxp19764 po=true for some pictures of Blessle.Price~~~~This camp site only cost E7.50 for 2 of us our tent and car it would be extra for an electric hook up but we did not need this.If I were going to Camp in this area again I might use this camp site again  It was a place to rest my head, not good if you want restaurant , bar , club type campsite but good peaceful and cheap  .       ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5522492:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6757811:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6789555:4:::5567145:4:::6410840:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5717149:4:::5717501:4:::6559995:4:::6559995:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6805797:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5439461:4:::6474927:4:::6699566:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6804694:5:::6804694:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The ingredients Water, Carrots, Whole meal Pasta from Wheat (10  Cooked), Potatoes, Onions, Concentrated Tomato Paste (3 ), Tomatoes (2 ), Green Beans, Green Peppers (1.5 ), Modified Cornflour, Red Peppers (1 ), Celery, Salt, Honey, Yeast Extract, Garlic Puree, Dried Basil, Oregano, Black Pepper, Vegetables (27 ). Contains Celery, Gluten, and Wheat   Whole meal. To open this can is easy it has a ring pull. I heated mine in a microwave I had poured it into 2 bowls and microwaved each one for 2 mins20seconds. I could have used a saucepan over the hob but it s easier and saves washing up done in the microwave. The instructions for cooking are on the can. We sat down to eat this soup hubby not ecstatic as he did not fancy soup with big pieces of vegetables in it. (He has a sore throat) This soup tastes pleasant it is a tomato flavored vegetable soup and you can taster the Mediterranean herbs: - garlic basil, oregano. There is some pasta in this soup too makes it a bit more substantial. I liked this soup goes well with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top or eaten with cheese on toast if you are very hungry, goes well with a chunk of crusty bread too. Yes it was a pleasant satisfying soup for lunch, not too many calories before Christmas...      ::::5719918:3:::21963:3:::5522492:3:::6264199:3:::6290957:3:::6703843:3:::6703843:3:::6657747:3:::5891:3:::5891:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6609678:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::3728:3:::3728:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6778369:3:::6778369:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6757552:4:::6757552:4:::6781956:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6559995:4:::6559995:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6757811:4:::6410840:4:::6806086:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5690767:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5567145:4:::6805797:4:::6789555:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5439461:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6692766:4:::6692766:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I saw it in a toy shop and bought it as a stocking filler. This train will cost    2.99 from http://www.treasureislandtoys.co.uk/ or from http://www.smartstart-toys.co.uk. This train comes in a choice of 4 colours. The natural wooden base sits on black wheels and the cab can be either red blue yellow or green the3 engines a different colour blue yellow green or red respectively . On the side of the train there is a small handle /knob to twist this will wind the train up .When released this little train will wizz across the floor. These trains will wizz along the floor or table. Pin toys also make a wooden railway track that is compatible. These toy trains are only little W6.5cm x D4cm x H4.5cm. They are suitable for over 3 year olds. I think these trains quite durable seem well made, look attractive and are fun. Your child will need to be able to turn/twist the small lever, but if not they could always just give it a push.

       " '5247778::::Royal Doulton Bunnykins China Plate::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::09.12.2009::::    I was perusing the bunnykins section on the internet and remembered the plate my daughter used to have, I think it got broken. I can not remember the design on it there are so many designs now Royal Doulton rotates these and produces different picture plates in different years.  There are cups bowls, plates, a clock and other Bunnykins china objects. Bunnykins is now made in melamine too much more durable,Royal Doulton make the series of children   s fine china with the bunnykins pictures on. Sister Mary Barbara  a  Nun daughter of  the factory s general manager Cuthbert Bailey drew the pictures of the bunnies in secret in her convent as the  Reverend mother did not approve. Her pictures are endearing pictures of rabbits in  clothing  going about their daily lives , having picnics , kite flying , ice skating and many more .  Bunnykins products were first made in 1934 so that   s 75 years ago. These pictures are transfer printed on to the white china.  Today I am talking about the Bunnykins china standard plate. You can buy a couple of different items as plates  the Royal daulton bunnykins baby plate or the standard plate  the baby plate has straight raised edges  you can buy both in  china or melamine .  The Bunnykins china is dishwasher and microwave friendly.  On the base of the plate there is usually a bunnykins royal Doulton stamp some early years did not have a stamp on them .This Bunnykins plate is made of fine bone china, very fragile if dropped, thrown across the room   so only use if your child past that stage .  My daughter did have a bunnykins plate.  I let her use it and it smashed when dropped one day . You might prefer to keep  yours unused  at least till  your child is older It is sized 20cm  as good sized plate for your child   s dinner or cakes. It is not a completely flat platter it has those slightly raised edges most plates have . On this raised edge around the circumference of the plate run lots of the bunnykins they are  generally the same whatever the design on the centre of the plate . There are many bunnykins pictures designs that are in the centre of the plate these do change fairly regularly rotating   pictures include bunnies fishing , bunnies kite flying , bunnies picnicking or mending cars all sorts of everyday human activities. The bunnies are dressed in human clothing and in human positions. The pictures on the plates are really quite endearing beautifully  drawn.  The bunny pictures on the bottom of the plate act as a good incentive for a small child to eat all their food so they can see the picture . There is so much to see and talk about in these pictures so your child can join in the after dinner conservation so good for language development.You will probably be able to buy a couple of designs on newer plates, but there are sites selling many older designs. If you have a really old plate it might be worth a bit of money if sold. These plates can be bought individually or as part of sets from good china shops on or off line . On line there is selection at http://www.kingsandqueens.org.uk price    8 RRP    10.  Look on Amazon and you will find older designs available too These plates  and other Bunnykins  nursery ware make ideal birthing , christening presents.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6755322:4:::5522492:4:::6163519:4:::6163519:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6410840:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6145850:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6783831:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6757811:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6803295:4:::6378505:4:::6657747:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Peak Road & Rail Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.12.2009::::    I was playing alongside 2. 6 year old special needs children with this Little Tikes peaks road and rail set. This toy is suitable for children aged over 12 months. I think it is suitable for 2, 3, 4 year olds and personally prefer the Duplo or Brio train sets. However when ever we get this train set out we do have children happily playing with it . Like all train/road sets you need a fairly big area to play it on. This set has 44 pieces it has two large green hill /mountain pieces with holes in for tunnelling the track under and a landing pad for the helicopter on the top, the top green section also has slope slide areas so you can build your road up and through the mountain. This green mountain is easy to assembly one piece just fits on top of the other. There are 11 pieces of road, which is just enough to complete a circuit. There is a blue bridge included. The railway can go under this bridge if you wish. There are 20 pieces of rail and 2 crossing gates. This also just completes a circuit going under one of the tunnels under the mountain. There are 5 vehicles including a helicopter , not enough vehicles really for 2 or 3 tots playing together . There are also 3 rounded people to fit in the trucks and trains. This set is full of bright colours. The yellow road and the grey rail is joined together with jigsaw like ends knobbles and holes. My children found these fairly easy to fit. My children were fully engrossed playing with this toy . It is good for practising those fine motor skills, good for social play (learning to share and play together), shame there were not more vehicles, still we solved that and used some cars and trains from the car box. The tracks and road fairly wide so quite a few small cars fit on . As well as needing a large area of floor to put this on it fits better on hard floor carpet is ok but only just, it also needs a large storage space because of the green mountain pieces a large plastic storage box would probably do the trick but the green mountains are a nuisance for storing . This road and rail set costs   39.99p from http://www.activetoy.co.uk/ Would I recommend? Its ok but I think I prefer Duplo or Brio trains and road systems. However this toy is sturdy and durable should last many play hours, This toy ideal for play group or early years play setting.      ::::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::6810361:3:::6733652:3:::6733652:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6740155:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5567145:4:::5522492:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6506577:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6410840:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5328942:4:::5719918:4:::6657747:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6625623:4:::6625623:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::First Years Fun Sounds Hammer::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.12.2009::::    Babies love hitting things ,  give them a wooden spoon and baby will gaily hit the saucepan , his feeding tray , the cat anything which makes a noise .    I know this  fun sounds hammer toy so thought I would write about it. This toy is suitable for baby from 3 months, It is a clear squat plastic hammer shape The base bottom couple of cm a dark blue plastic. The handle has some molded ridge grips. The hammer head is shaped like a hippo head. There are 2 googgley eyes on the hammer head.Down the inner centre of the hammer is a yellow plastic stem this has a few    branches along it. Then a yellow disk fits across the space where the head meets the stem. This disc has a few circular holes in it. Also inside this hammer there are several coloured plastic balls. These will go through those holes in that yellow plastic disc    The length of this hammer 756 mm the width 339mm. So lets give it to baby what does he/she think ? he/she threw it straight on the floor.  Look baby here it is I hold the rattle and shake it look the coloured balls move about , listen there is a clattering sound as they move .  Look baby where is the rattle first to the right then to the left , baby has good eye movement that   s right up and down too baby must like he is smiling .. I know sound test  I shake the hammer rattle behind baby, then down on the floor under his chair , baby is searching for the toy can hear it  yes here it is . Baby, hold it now. Baby will hold and shake this toy.He will look at the beads inside. Baby will love throwing this toy on the floor for you to retrieve. I would guestimate that by the age of one baby will want a toy with more stimulus than this. I have used this toy with special needs nursery children to gain their attention to get them to hold and grip, to encourage hand eye coordination and to identify where the sound comes from. I did peruse the web to see how much this cost the only site I could find actually with one in stock was. This toy has actually been about a few years now maybe not produced anymoreThis toy is dishwasher safe yes it will get grubby with baby   s sticky fingers.http://www.modernseniors.com  are offering it for  3,75 Amazon did have it bit no longer has. I imagine you should pay less than a fiver for this toy anywhere. However if you really want a toy like this early learning centre done similar or give baby your wooden spoons or fill up a plastic bottle with beans make sure you seal the top up firmly and baby will have fun shaking  this and throwing it on the floor .     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6290957:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6757811:4:::6410840:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::21963:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5328942:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6474927:4:::5439461:4:::6804694:4:::6804694:4:::6218348:4:::6378505:4:::5609841:4:::5609841:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Snakes and Ladders, Dunstable::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::07.12.2009::::    I was visiting my daughter in the holidays and decided to take the children to Snakes and Ladders an indoor play centre in Dunstable. This is situated about on the outskirts of Dunstable on Blackburn road Houghton Regis, Dunstable. This is a small industrial estate. There is a soft play area at the Dunstable leisure centre, I have frequented there more often but my grandson is getting too big for there and the Snakes and ladders centre more challenging / suitable for him There is some parking here but I caught the bus in the centre of Dunstable with the 2 children and got off in the street next to Blackburn road. Just inside the Entrance is the admission desk price is    4.90 for under 2 s over 2 but under 5    5.90 over 5 s    6.90 There is a limit on height for admission which is 4 foot 8in. Accompanying over 10 s and adults    1. The price allows you in the play centre for 2 hours which is about long enough. Opening times are 7 days a week from 10am till 6pm, last admissions 5.15. Will be shut Christmas and Boxing day, closing early on new years eve and Christmas eve, opening at 12 noon on New years day. When inside there is a massive 3 tier play frame to clamber up slide down to crawl through tunnels to climb ropes . There was a large ball pool in here too. My grandson aged 6 enjoyed this, my granddaughter just 3 could just cope with some of it. There was a play area for 2 to 5 year olds with less demanding play activities with a ball pool and lower slides. My granddaughter had a great time in here swinging and charging around. There is a separate safe play area for toddlers. Then there are always the electric motorbikes in their own area. You do have to pay additional price for these, can t remember how much now. The grandchildren did enjoy their visit got thourou ghly worn out which was my aim. Although there are staff patrolling and watching the equipment and every effort is made to ensure your children s safety, the supervision of your children is your responsibility. You and your children are not allowed on the equipment with your shoes on but you must keep socks on. Children must remove glasses, jewellery badges and all sharp objects. No food drink, chewing gum is to be consumed in the play area. It is advisable to wear long sleeves and trousers or tights to cover arms and legs to stop friction burns There are quite a lot of tables and chairs situated in an area by the caf   /snack bar. You can sit here and watch your children play, a lot of the areas are visible from here. The snack bar sells hot and cold drinks, food such as chips, chicken nuggets, sausage, quiche, fish fingers. There are chocolate and crisps, cookies and ice cream. The price about what you would expect. I did treat my grandkids to lunch out as a treat to my daughter the meals were a fair child size of course being  quot;junk food quot; the kids loved it quot; On the way out you pass through the small shop are we walked past quickly If you wish you can book a child s party here prices and details at http://www.snakes-and-ladders.co.uk/dunstable_birt hday_parties.html. It cost a    9.50 for the basic party food and entrance extras cost extra. There are Snakes and ladders play centres in a few other towns too      ::::5816422:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5717501:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6805797:4:::6802070:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5567145:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6410840:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5439461:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio double suspension bridge::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::07.12.2009::::    We are playing with the Brio trains again today. My grandchildren and the class where I work have a large amount of Brio trains and accessories. Some of it is the real Brio wooden train sets and some is Brio compatible from other companies. The Box of brio track gets emptied on the floor and track laid, to make it more interesting we have the double suspension bridge. Just over 1 metre long at 3.5 feet its  Length: 1134mm (44.7 quot;). The highest point is just over 7 inches/18cm. This is Brio   s longest bridge it is Modelled after San Francisco   s famous Golden Gate, The pieces that make this bridge are 2 red bridge sections these are plastic and the track that goes over them is wooden. There is a short piece of track (A1) that can be used to join the bridge parts together. There are also 2 ascending N tracks one for each side of the suspension bridge.These bits are all fairly simple to put together with those  jigsaw like cojoining pieces , one end has a female  cojoining cut out , one end the  male joining part. There are groves for the train on both sides of the track pieces so it does not matter which way up you use the track.  When erected this double suspension bridge can cross a large canyon or a  motorway. There is room under the bridges for toy cars to go under. This double suspension bridge could be used as a single suspension bridge, shame there are not 4 ascending tracks , however if you wished you could buy them in a pack containing 2 track pieces, or buy two single suspension bridges. This track is suitable for a 3 year old and over, my grandson aged nearly 7 still enjoys playing with his occasionally, his little sister aged 3 1/2  enjoys it too.I LOVE Brio trains and track they are made out of Birch wood and is very durable. I expect this piece and the rest of the brio train sets we have will be kept for the next generation.Brio trains are great for your childrens imaginative play and thier construction skills. This double suspension bridge if used with other brio track offers many opportunities for the young rail designer to solver problems of crossing roads rivers and mountains. I have seen this bridge constructed with a long section of track joining the red bridge parts together and in a row of about 5 of the bridge parts. If you have a 4 year old with a Brio or Brio compatible train set then this would make a good present, a bit more challenging and exciting than just the basic circle track.Do have fun playing trains with your children and their Brio I know I do. Brio ~~~~Brio makes fantastic long lasting classical wooden toys, really good quality. Brio was started   in 1884 by a Swedish basket-maker Ivar Bengtsson who in 1907 started making wooden toys and Brio has developed from there.              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Would I recommend ? Yes of course I would. You can buy this double suspension bridge for    10.99 from Amazon uk from Amazon .com its  189.99 AT  http://www.kidsen.co.uk  it costs    17.99 a lot of on line shops selling for around the    15 mark.

One of the toys we have is the box of 6, 2 piece puzzles of pets. These puzzles are suitable for children aged 18 months and over. I use them with older special needs pupils. Although the pictures of the pets are cute and big eyed they are not over babyish. Included in this set of 6 puzzles is a budgie, a dog, a cat, a goldfish, a hamster and rabbit all animals that children may be familiar with. They are good realistic colours. These puzzles are made of a thick durable recycled board. The surface is a wipe clean one. These individual 2 piece puzzles are shaped around the outline of the pictured animal no straight edges. Each one cut in approximate half. The way you fit the two pieces of each animal together is by the cojoining male and female parts. Each of these puzzles is approx 14cm x 14cm each. They do fit together fairly easily.These puzzles are good for baby practicing his/her eye hand and fine motor control, learning how to fit pieces together. While doing these puzzles alongside your baby /child is learning about animals what they look like and do talk to your child tell them the names of the animal say the colours, and tell your child what noises the animals make.

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 4964: Highway Help::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::04.12.2009::::    You can   t go far wrong buying a child between 2 and 4 a Duplo Lego toy they will get played with and a 5, 6 or 7 year old will still be happy to play with Duplo.   This highway help breakdown set will please many little boys and a few girls too. Included in this set is a yellow breakdown tow truck. The truck has    flashing    warning lights on top and a tow hook There is seating for the 2 repair men in the truck cab.. Two male mini figures come with this set one has reddish brown hair and blue yes. One has dark blue trousers a green top. The other mechanic has brown hair, brown eyes blue trousers green shirt a red cap both have smilesTheir legs and arms move their hands are those playmobil claws that will either hold the tools or they can push a baby pram. There is a red sports car this can be hooked up to the tow truck. There is a little red work truck with a took drawer and a hose. There are some gauges marked on this truck. On the top of the drawer is 4 Duplo studs so the warning triangle that comes with this set can be fitted, a standard 4 pip/stud Duplo brick would fit here too. An oil can also comes with this set as well as a spanner. Then there are a couple of grey bricks and  a couple of yellow and black striped ones one yellow brick come with a black arrow on it this will make a warning sign for oncoming Duplo traffic. In total there are 26 bricks.I think this is a good set there is plenty of play potential. Not only is there a little construction of the bricks but the imaginary play that comes out of this toy is great. The children will pretend that they have broken down or that they are the mechanics. This toy can be played with by a child on his/her own or by 2 or 3 children together.  I love to listen to children as they play their conversations I can often hear myself in their talk. Playing with toys like this is good it develops their language you can pop in a word or two that they do not know. This high way help set can be used on its own or with other Duplo bricks. This set is good you can encourage sharing and playing together. A Duplo brick is twice the size of a Lego brick but they are compatible. I think this breakdown repair set is good, Duplo is a good product it is well made lasts for ages washes well. I personally have Duplo that has lasted my daughter and her children too  it must be 30 + years old. Duplo is one of if not the best cojoining bricks for 2-5 year olds. This set can be bought in many places that sell toys it is available from Amazon for    34.00     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::21963:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6805797:4:::6290957:4:::6789555:4:::6757811:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6781956:4:::5567145:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6746512:4:::6746512:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Sacla Stir Through Tomato & Garlic::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::03.12.2009::::    I recently was feeling lazy and wanted to prepare and cook something for an evening after work meal, so I emptied about 200g of pasts into a saucepan and cooked for about 12 minutes. I then drained the pasta put it back in my saucepan. Next I opened the twist cap to a glass jar containing 190g of Sacla Stir through Tomato   Garlic Sauce. I emptied this into the pasta, over the gas hob I then stirred it in while heating it for a couple of minutes.. I then served out about half of it into 2 servings left the other half, I did freeze the other half for a quick freezer meal one night. This sauce can be kept in its opened jar for a week or so in the fridge, but I always forget to use or how long they have been in fridge.. After serving I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top.This meal tasted good a good tomato flavour and a light garlic flavour. It certainly has that Italian pasta taste. This made a good quick satisfying cold nights meal  , it went down well with some French bread I have also eaten garlic bread with it too .In 100g of this sauce, without the pasta of course there is 168 caloriesSacla an Italian company base in Asti was eestablished in 1923, they make a range of pasta sauces and pastes. http://www.ocado.com sells it for    1.99 as does Tesco   s and Sainsbury   sWould I recommend?

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Creative Bucket 5538::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::03.12.2009::::    I have a toddler of 18 months to buy a present for this year, so have been looking at Duplo. I know 18 months is a little young as Duplo bricks are really suitable for children aged 2 years old and over up to about 5 years and even then older children will still play with Duplo bricks. I investigated this Lego Duplo Creative Bucket (5538) and it was    17.99p at    Toys are us    a bit more expensive than I wanted to pay for my nieces baby.At http://shop.lego.com its    17.59 However this bucket of bricks looks really good. The Duplo bricks come in a sturdy plastic deep squared tub it has a lid with 4 large Duplo studs and the sides have info about the bricks stuck on. These tubs are really good for storage much better than card boxes. Inside the tub are 76 bricks of Duplo plenty for a starter or add on set. Now these bricks are not all basic bricks. There are lots of the basic bricks in red yellow green and blue some orange ones too. They have 4 studs or 8 studs. Also there are a couple of yellow 4 stud bricks with big eyes printed on.There are a few 8 stud slim bricks that could be used as a base for a tall creation or a roof for the carThere is also a few 5 petalled, one studded flower bricks these are red and green.Next I noticed a couple of green windows these open and shut. There are some clear plastic basic bricks too these could be used as windows too. Then there are some wheels these are yellow wheels fitted to blue bricks. This is a good selection of bricks basic ones to get started on then some other shapes to fire that imagination. Now I have played with 100000000000000,s of Duplo bricks. They were Invented in 1967 and first marketed in 1969, Now I Started training in child care-education in 1970 in the early 70   s is when my experiences of Duplo began. Duplo bricks are made by the Lego they are twice the size of Lego bricks and will fit together. When your child as at that transition stage between the two bricks, this is ideal. Duplo bricks are really too big to swallow and are safe for that toddler who mouths everything.  They are so easy to wash and disinfect if necessary use just hot soapy water or something stronger but safe if there is a germ going around the nursery.This Duplo creative bucket should last for many, many play hours and stay in good condition for years. There isn   t much that will break a Duplo brick, a child may chew it but the bricks are very resilient show little damage This Lego creative bucket is great for your child   s development. They encourage that fine motor skill, good for hand eye co-ordination will be good for those first construction skills. Ideal for imaginary play your child will make a    house    and a    car    and have many adventures reliving events and practicing new ones. I have listened to many a child   s conversations with themselves and Duplo its quite eye opening Play along side your child with their Duplo, you can use this time for foundation math   s counting the bricks, sorting the colours using the correct vocabulary high low, more, less.  Your child does not know it but play is a child   s work so many things to learn while playing with Duplo. This box is big enough for 1 child to play with on his/her own or for a group of 2 or 3 children. It   s good to play with other children to learn about sharing and cooperative play, making friends and playing together. A 2 year old will play happily alongside another but it is not trill nearly 3 and sometimes over that they will actually play together cooperatively. So would I recommend this Lego Duplo Creative Bucket (5538)? Yes it has a good selection of standard bricks and additional bricks to make it interesting. The bucket /tub it comes in, is ideal for storage. You can   t go far wrong buying this for either a girl or a boy.Have fun playing with this bucket of bricks and your children on Christmas day. I will not see my great nephew but my grandchildren will be opening the smaller Lego this Christmas so lots of fun here for me        ::::6740155:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::21963:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6657747:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5567145:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5439461:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

At the other end is a black seals foot.  Each one has Zoggs printed in black around the coloured tube. They are made of a smooth plastic. The tube is a softer a more flexible plastic than the head and foot. These sticks are quite durable. These seals are weighted so when thrown into the swimming pool they will sing to the bottom and stand on the bottom of the pool.

This books front cover has a three eyes grinning alien head on a blue background with stars on it . It is a paper back book with 144 pages it has 500 jokes in it. My grandson a fairly good reader quite enjoys this book. The jokes are short and corny. I politely laugh when he reads them to me of course These jokes are short each one only 8 or ten words then the punch line response 1 to 10 words too. Most of the words are simple 3, 4, 5 letters with the occasional longer word. I will give you an example of a couple of the jokes. What stars go to jail?. ............................................Shooti ng stars What are flying saucers used for? ............................ To hold flying cups Did you hear about the alien who sat under a cow?.......... He got a pat on the head Why do aliens tickle you before they eat you? ............. They want a happy meal The rest of the jokes are of similar humour If you want to buy this book http://www.whsmith.co.uk has it for    2.99. Karen King has written a few other similar joke books including, the even smellier socks joke book. and the school rules joke book. I expect these jokes to be of similar quality.

       " '5247778::::Fireman Sam Five Articulated Figures::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::30.11.2009::::    Fireman Sam - Set of 5 Articulated Figures  We have a huge plastic box of plastic figures at work. When I was playing with them last week I found myself playing with these Martin Yaffe fireman Sam figures. These figures are also sold under the born to play label.I notice there is a set of 5 of these figures available including Sam. Tom, Penny, Nurse Flood and Norman.  They all look identical to the tv characters dressed in their uniforms ready for action. The faces of these figures are more expressive have more character than Playmobil figures These figures are all about 9cm tall a good size for a child to grip and move about . They all have movable arms legs and head. Their hands cup shaped will grasp and hold the steering wheel of the fire engine.This set of figures is good very durable, will wash well in hot soapy water. They have good play value for a child who likes the fireman Sam series.As I sit playing with these figures and the children I listen to the children   s conversation. The children are playing out real life situations and ones they have seen on the television. While playing I will drop words and sentences into the conversation to extend the children   s vocabularyOne day they might need a real fireman    Sam    or a nurse    flood    these toys  will help prepare them for that event. These toys could also be used in play therapy after a situation. Children like these figures m so do I. While playing with these figures children are learning.

       " '5247778::::Whitworths French Glace Cherries::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::20.11.2009::::          As well as the Tesco natural glace cherries, Tesco also sell Whitworths French Glace Cherries natural colour. These are available in a 200g pot for    1.97 making them 78p a pot more expensive than the Tesco ones I wrote about recently. I did buy both the pots at the same time to compare as I shall soon be making my Christmas cake.The pots are an identical clear plastic see through the lid on the Whitworths is a clear see through one too. It has a bright red label pronouncing that it contains Whitworth   s cherries. There are 324 kcal to 1`00g of Whitworth   s glace cherries   Breaking the seal on the lid I open and try one. It tastes good, sweet, do I think its better /different to the Tesco ones?  There is such a slight difference I think the Whitworths one might just be slightly better a slightly, minutely stronger cherry flavour but only just. The texture and size of the cherries is about the same as the Tesco ones. The texture is slightly leathery chewy, not plump and moist. There is some sweet stickiness about then.  I would use these for the same recipes as the Tesco ones Christmas cakes and puddings, cheery cakes and scones. Like all glace cherries there is a possibility that they will sink to the bottom of the cake so toss in flour or corn flour as several members here on dooyoo advise to stop this. My granddaughter does not likesultanas and raisins  so when I make a batch of fruit scones for family visits then I often make a few cherry ones My recipe 225g SR flour, tblsp sugar, 75g butter or marge 1 egg , 50ml milk, 75g glace cherries Weigh flour and rub in the butter add the sugar stir in chopped cherries add the beaten egg and milk except for 1 tbsp of milk use this to glaze scones. Mix to make soft dough. roll out till 2 cm thick / nearly 1 inch  cut into required shape then bake for about 9 minutes. Oven temperature 220c These are great warm. I think these cherries make pretty good cakes and scones but I really do not think they are worth the extra money over Tesco   s own. Whitworths is a producer that has been supplying dried fruits and glace cherries for many years, I remember my mum buying this variety of fruits.  The fruits they produce and dry are of a good quality these cherries no exception. .However the price will determine my purchase     ::::5522492:3:::6749875:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6750576:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6145850:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6802070:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6609678:4:::21963:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6805797:4:::6789555:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5347743:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6729329:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It is an ideal toy for    real    farm play or ideal for a modeller to put in his model farm fields.

Equally this tractor is at home played alongside Ben ten or bob the builder toys. This toy is suitable for a child over 3 years old. I think an older child would get more from this toy though. This Britain   s tractor is one of many scale model tractors that Britain   s produce. It is a red tractor, It looks just like a tractor with 2 larger black back wheel at the back, and 2 smaller black wheels at the front.  The front wheels are steerable. There is a black hitch at the back so the tractor can pull Britain   s farm wagonsThe tractor is made of a red dye cast metal. The cab has plastic see through windows through which you can see the steering wheel and seat the roof of the cab is red. This cab is detachable so your farmer can drive his tractor either with or without the cab.

I used her hand trowel it was a Spear   Jackson Elements Hand Trowel. She has had this trowel for a while now and it looks like it will last her many more years. Spear and Jackson is an old reliable firm making tools of a good standard..This Trowel has a 5 inch/12cm ash handle which has been weatherproofed and finished with a lacquer /varnish. A hole is drilled through the top this has a leather strap threaded through it so you can easily hang the trowel up on a hook. .The hammer finished epoxy coated head gives improved resistance to rust, scratches, humidity and alkaline in the soil.  This has a small stem which fits into the wooden handle firmly with a ferrule of the same material as the blade. The blade is strong will not bend and it is very firmly fitted into the handle. I found this  trowel comfortable to hold the handle slightly shaped. This little hand trowel is an ideal size for weeding around my daughter rose bush and weeding out her forget-me-nots that have gone to seed.  It is also a good size for the grandchildren to help, or to dig in their sand pit with too . It will be ideal for using when planting or potting bulbs. .

       " '5247778::::Pams Jungle Party Theme Plates::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::17.11.2009::::    Are there going to be lots of wild animals at your party? if so you maybe having a jungle themed party. These jungle paper plates will be just the thing for your guests to eat their food from.  I went to a child   s party recently and the food was on these plates. I am not sure where the hostess got these plates from but they are available at many on line shops probably also available in party shops in the high street. On line they cost    2.75 for a pack of 8 from http://www.parteaz.co.ukOr 8 plates for    2.10 from http://www.balloons.co.uk or http://www.justforfun.co.uk has them for    2.99. There are several different jungle themed plates available. The ones I am talking about are 9 inches/22.8cm in diameter. They are paper plates with one face colours and with animal pictures on it . . The design of this plate is divided in to 4 equal quarters  one quarter has an blue elephant eating an apple this has a purple background , there is a monkey eating a banana in another quarter  , he sits smiling at you from a green background. The happy yellow lion with his golden orange mane smiles at you from his blue corner, and in the red corner is the head and neck of zebra. The outer rim of the plate has the colours in different quarters. There plates are bright and attractive. The children liked looking at the animals on the plates. The children helped themselves to jungle food, most of which was dry like nuts, sausages, crisps and some fruits. This plate will not get too soggy if the items on it are moist. . The quality of these plates is fair. They are a throw away item but you should be able to save some by just wiping clean with a just damp cloth These plates are great for eating food off but they could always be used for sorting small lion   s monkeys, elephants and zebra, your child placing the correct plastic animal in the correct position. They could also be stuck on the wall with blu -tac as jungle decoration. These plates were quite good the design fine. Ideal for an under 4 or 5 year old party I think as the pictures are quite  babyish round faces with dot eyes and smiles. I think a jungle party sounds like fun so much you could do animal games,  rhymes and animal shape foods , There is an abundance of jungle party ware available to complement these plates. Have fun.

       " '5247778::::Montpellier le Vieux, Aveyron::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::16.11.2009::::     While on holiday we visited Montpellier Le Vieux (Montpellier the old man)This natural park is in the area called Aveyron in the south of France about 12k from Millau along the d110.. This is a natural site known for its rock formations its fauna and flora. It is a spectacular sight of   grey coloured black causse rock that has been shaped by the wind, the rain and time to make the most amazing shapes. The whole of this area of France is very rocky. This small spectacular, site Montpellier le vieux was discovered and developed in the late 1800   s early 1900   s into the site we found.We found this site by following a map we had it was not really very easy to find there were few signs along the road and we did find one leading to a narrow road which went quite a long way before we reached parking for Montpellier le vieux. There are charges to walk around this site E5.45 for an adult E4.45 for between 15 -20 years olds E3.90 for a child over 3. . At the entrance there is a map on a board and maps and guides can be bought in the little shop.  There are several routes around this rocky site including a route by a little train. You could as we did walk part of the way then take the train back to the start. The train costs 3.50E for an adult 2.60 for a child. The train is an open but roofed tourist train..The track we took around this park was fairly well marked and fairly good underfoot in most places. It was rocky, some bits steep but the children scampered along well. I would suggest it is not very suitable for someone who is very disabled apart that they could experience the rock formations from the train ride. There are a few trees and bushes around this site and some interesting flora dependant on the season of course.. I think you would need to allow yourselves about 1 to2 hours to walk and wonder at the rock formations. We took a picnic lunch and were there about 3 hours. You could easily spend a complete day here though, as we only walked one of the shorter routes and we were slow as I still have this tendon injury which means I am more cautious about where I walk..Some of the rock formations were called animal names , the Elephant , the crocodile , dog head  and if you used a little imagination looked at these rocks from the right angle you could see the resemblance There was a compete arch across the path, Lots of other walkers were taking photos here.  This park is definately somewhere to visit , or revisit in my case  next time we will take a different track .     ::::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5522492:3:::6239064:3:::6239064:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6750576:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6145850:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6789555:4:::6805797:4:::5717501:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6378505:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6506265:4:::6506265:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6805993:4:::6805993:4:::6806114:4:::6806114:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6290957:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6410840:4:::6786123:4:::6786123:4:::6788089:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6748939:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::5790028:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5567145:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Bigjigs Toys Wooden Play Farm::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::14.11.2009::::    I have played with this farm (alongside a child) at a play centre and would like to tell you about it. .This farm is a wooden farm it comes with a thin wooden plywood base that is painted green to represent grass and has a blue area to represent water painted on in one of the corners. A few flowers are also painted on the green board as well as a path of stepping stones. .There are some farm buildings. The buildings are natural wood coloured with red roofs. There is a dog kennel, a windmill the sails do rotate. An open fronted wooden building with a few shelves this is stabling for the horses or shelter for the cows the chickens can roost on the shelves. Then a wooden building for the pig sty, perhaps as they do just fit inside it. .The essential feature of the farm is the animal,s I will admit The farm I played with had the addition of other toy animals and perhaps not all of the Bigjig toy animals that should come with this farm. However most of the Bigjig animals were there. The big jig animals like the frees are not 3D they are flat, about 1cm thick so they do stand up reasonably well. There are a couple of pink pigs, a couple of sheep, two cows two horses,, two chickens a dog and a ginger cat. There is a wooden 2 dimensional farmer and his wife too. There is a tractor and a wooden lawn mower (at least that s what I think it is.) Then there is a wooden 3 dimensional wheelbarrow with a wooden spade. There are a couple of wooden tubs for animal feed .Then there are a few wooden trees these stand on a firm base, they are not 3d though they are flat, probably about1cm thick I seem to recall. A couple of the trees are fruit trees the painted green leaf area has a few coloured dots on to represent fruit, then there is a pine/fir tree shaped tree too. To complete the farm scene there are a few wooden fences and a few wooden rows of vegetables one has carrots painted on, one row cabbages. .This is quite a good wooden toy I like the wooden painted base, I will be honest although the animals are simplified basic shapes and feature they do look like the animals represented I do prefer 3D farm animals to play with. .This is a reasonably strong farm, the quality fair, it should last many play hours good for either home or nursery. This toy can be played with other farm animals and sets to make a bigger more adventurous farm scene. .This toy suitable for a 3 year old and over. It does have play value. Your child will lear a little about the animals while they are playing , do play alongside yourtot use the names of the animals . say the noises they make . count the animals, group the same animals together .. Your child will pretend to feed the animals walk them around the farm base , talk to them . This set is good for imaginary play and speech development . .Although this farm is a few years old now it is still available to buy at several toy distributors. At http://www.amazon.co.uk Little wooden wonders is offering it for the price of    19.95 http://www.bigjigs.co.uk is selling it but this site is only for trade customers so I can not get the price details. .Would I recommend? Well it is a long lasting, well made classic toy but I do prefer 3d animals.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::6145850:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5522492:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5285637:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6805797:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6784650:4:::6784650:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6778030:4:::5366599:4:::5366599:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6605930:4:::6789555:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6410840:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::21963:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Betterware Large Heavy Duty Oven Liner::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::12.11.2009::::    We regularly have a Betterware booklet posted through our door as we have a sales representative living just round the corner..I rarely buy from this catalogue, but I was browsing through  and saw this oven liner. I had the previous day cleaned my oven, not a job I love. This is what inspired me to buy this large heavy duty oven liner.. You may be a neat cook with never getting any spillages or fat sprays on the oven floor , however I am not and decided this oven liner might save  me some work. I ordered this oven liner from my representative and waited a week for delivery  . If you have no local salesperson you can buy online at http://www.betterware.co.uk. Product Code: 039422. This liner cost me    9.99. This liner is a large liner 50 x 40cm (19 3/4 quot; x 15 3/4 quot;) too big for the floor of my oven so I cut it easily with a pair of scissors . The cut of piece that I did not put in my oven may be big enough to line a small cooking tray I have.. The liner is a thick fabric, not stick PTFE coated. I have used this liner for a while now and find it great spillages and greaser easily wipe off. Its easy to clean, you can wipe spillages off it with warm soapy water while it is still in the oven or  I wash with warm soapy water in my bowl , but it is dishwasher safe.  This liner is suitable for fan assisted and normal ovens..I find it does save mess on the bottom of the oven and cleaning is easy so yes I would recommend. I am glad I have mine before that huge Christmas time baking session.     ::::5719918:3:::5522492:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6750576:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::6781956:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6776473:4:::6776473:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6145850:4:::6371369:4:::6371369:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5567145:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6410840:4:::6657747:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6789555:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6799546:4:::6799546:4:::6729329:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6248607:4:::6474927:4:::6800001:4:::6800001:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6627139:4:::6627139:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Gardman Framed Willow Trellis Panel::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::12.11.2009::::    A couple of years ago I bought this Gardman framed Willow trellis. I bought mine from our local garden centre. I notice on line they are still available from several different on line garden shops. I give you the web address of 1, https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk . There are 2 sizes of this framed trellis available Panel 45cm x 1.2m and Panel 60cm x 1.8m. I bought the 0.60m/2ft by 1.8m/ 6 ft This was the perfect size for me. The price at webs direct is    15.99p,    10.99p for the smaller one . This trellis is made of willow wands fitted together in a diamond lattice pattern. These are then fixed in a frame of willow strips about 4cm thick.. This framed trellis looks quite attractive, Why I bought this trellis~~~ I have to keep my black and green refuse bins in my front garden, I have no access at the side of the house and do not want to trail them through my sitting room every week . I think they look ugly standing on my fairly clean and attractive driveway at the front of the house in full view of everyone. The width of this trellis is almost exactly the same as a wheelie bin. So I thought I would screen my wheelie bin with a trellis covered in a climbing plant. How I fixed this trellis ~~~~ If I had been fixing this trellis to a wooden fence I would have nailed or screwed it in place. However I wanted it free standing at a right angle to the fence. So I found two pieces of fairly thick wood an old rafter I think it was. I fixed these at both ends of the trellis in a T joint each side This made the trellis fairly stable . I placed the trellis in front of my wheelie bin and decided to get a heavy planter and put it in front of the trellis. This has a dual purpose. Being heavy the planter stops the trellis being blown over and I can plant flowers and a climber in the planter too. How it copes with climbing plants~~~~~ Very well really I do not have a climber up it this year so it looks a bit barren , I shall remedy that at the garden centre soon by buying a new climber of some sort. The last climber I had, a honeysuckle turned up its toes last year. There is plenty of room in the pot for plants I have lots of spring bulbs then bedding plants in it Success and how it looks ~~~~~~ This is a successful screen it could do with being fitted a bit firmer but we rarely have winds strong enough to move it much. It does look a lot better than staring at my wheelie bins. Positioning ~~~~~~~~~~~ This open weave framed trellis is good support for climbing plants, either against a fence /wal orl as a small panel in a fence or use it as I have done as a screen . Durability~~~~~~~~ This is quite a durable trellis well made and mine has lasted 3 maybe 4 years now. The trellis diamonds are still fixed firm. You would expect with wood some decay eventually. My trellis shows no decay yet. I shall be treating this trellis with a wood preservative this autumn being careful not to get any preservative on my plants. This framed trellis is a good quality. This trellis is a natural willow colour bit if you really wanted to you could stain or paint it an alternative colour. Would I recommend ~~~~~~~~ Yes if you want a trellis this is a good one. .      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5285637:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6802070:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6716869:4:::6474927:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6802779:4:::5567145:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6378505:4:::6740155:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ulker Napoliten Milk Chocolate::::Food & Drink::::20::::helpful::::11.11.2009::::     When I was staying in Turkey this Easter I bought, a red pack of ULKER sutlu cikolate.  There were 33g of individually wrapped miniature chocolates inside his red box.  Each chocolate was like a square (except they were rectangular) of a larger bar..                                                                                                                These were individually wrapped in a gold foil then in a red paper. There were 12 in my little red packet.. I undid the wrapper and put one in my mouth. It was chocolate milk chocolate. It tasted ok but only just. This chocolate was not lush and creamy like Cadburys while it did not taste unpleasant it tasted a bit more like some of those inferior chocolate coins you get at Christmas. Sorry Ulker I did not really like your chocolate much I did not get tempted to buy any more while I was on holiday.. I can not remember how much I paid for this chocolate that I bought in a small supermarket /convenience store. I note on line it costs  0.99.  . The ingredients are Sugar,,cocoa Butter,Milk Powder,Cocoa Mass,Emulsifier (Soy Lecithin)Artificial Flavor (Ethyl Vanillin) Cocoa solids 31 .. So as you can imagine I would not really recommend this chocolate.

He has black unmovable wheels and his ladder is not moveable either. His face has those two white eyes watching you. Watch out Lofty has been immersed in Water and my child is pointing him at you.  Little hands squeeze the vehicle and a shoot of water comes out of the little hole at the front of the plastic moulded ladder. This squirt is not too fierce. This is ok but not a particularly easy squirter to squirt. Your hands need to be able to squeeze quite hard. This toy has lasted quite well a little faded maybe but still squirts Lofty is about 10 cm (L) x 5 cm (W) x 5 cm (H) a reasonable size for little hands to grip. This water squirter is suitable for a child 18 months and over. All children love water play. Water play is not just fun but educational too.

       " '5247778::::Champagne Bottle Bubbles::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::09.11.2009::::     I was fairly recently at a wedding where there were bottles of bubbles left on tables for guests to pick up. These bottles of bubbles were in a small green bottle (plastic) 9cm tall, containing   about     oz liquid. The bottle shaped like a champagne bottle with a gold coloured lid. There is a pink label on it saying bubbles and showing a picture of the rainbow wand. Twist  open the lid it is attached to a collar with a plastic fixer piece. The lid came off fairly easily. There is a little plastic wand inside the bubbles. Dipping the wand into the liquid the soap bubbble mix attached itself to the wand. Blowing the bubbles was easy they made lots and lots of small bubbles.When we had all assembled to watch the bride and groom throw the bouquet that   s when a lot of people blew the bubbles instead of confetti. These bubbles were really good they made 100   ds of snmall   bubbles. The liquid is  a good consistency coating the wand not too runny. They were good to glow floating in the air they looked pretty, magical all around the bride, who looked radiant.  There were a lot of bubbles blown from a bottle they last a long time. These bubbles make little mess they do not stain clothes, just as well with every one in their best for the wedding. The bottle has only a small neck, no other hole so that you so not drop it and lose lots of bubble mix. These bubbles are great for weddings and other celebrations they cost      3.99 for 6 bottles from http://www.londonhouseco.com  A box of 144 will cost 144 Champagne Bottle Bubbles     34.99 . http://www.diyfavourboxes.co.uk sell them too.

       " '5247778::::Flair Toys Melissa & Doug - Happy Handle Stamps::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::09.11.2009::::    Not too long ago I used these Flair Melissa and Doug happy handle stamps and was impressed.These wooden ink stamps come in a set of 6 with an ink stamp pad which is divided into 6 and has 6 different coloured inks these are a non toxic child friendly ink. I can not comment about the ink as I used this set without the ink pad I think the ink pad was mislaid. This set comes in a good case to keep them in tidily after use. I liked these shaped wooden stampers they were easy to hold and I did not get my fingers messy with ink. This is because the chunky shaped wooden handle to the stamps is long enough so that you can keep fingers away from the stamp.  The stamper is in fact a rubbery one fixed to the wooden handle. The designs on the ink stamp are a face, a flower, a paw print, a butterfly, a heart, some lips. These stamps are small about 1     cm in diameter. They make pretty neat clear stamped images on paper. These ink stamps are suitable for a child aged over 4. They will help and encourage creativity You can buy this set from http://www.amazon.co.uk for  8.97 the  RRP 9.99     ::::6731397:2:::6731397:2:::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5708451:3:::6806114:3:::6806114:3:::6145850:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6716869:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6410840:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6738963:3:::6738963:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6802779:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5803721:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6776705:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::3957:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::The Garden Bench Company Convertible Garden Bench::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::08.11.2009::::     Every year at half term we take the wooden garden furniture in , so last week into the conservatory went the garden bench. It will stay here until we get the summer here. June time we take our picnic bench /table out of hibernation from the conservatory.  We position it on the patio and celebrate the summer by sitting on it while consuming a cup of tea.  We have a picnic table that converts to a garden bench, or the other way round. It is a wooden one just like the picture. We have owned this bench for about 15 years now. The bench / table that we have is still in good order. The wood may be a looking a little older. I expect it will eventually decay. I think it is made of pine wood.This picnic table looks like ones you get in pub gardens although the ones in pubs do not fold up into a bench. The simple mechanism for turning it to table from bench is still in good condition. Its easier to unfold the bench with 2 people one at each end. You sort of unfold the bench and it makes a picnic table with a platform bench either side. Basically when it   s a table with the benches it measures about 5   quot; x 4  (1550mm x 1220mm). This will sit 4 people comfortably 6 at a squeeze. This picnic bench/table is a great space saver we have it as a bench until we need to convert it tom a table on those occasions we picnic or barbeque in the garden. This bench is available for    224 from http://www.thebenchcompany.co.uk I believer there are several other convertible garden benches available too by different manufacturers. This bench /table is really a good versatile piece of garden furniture. We have space to store ours in winter but you can by thick waterproof ciovers for these benches  , they really do need winter protection. Whe we take this bench/table out of hibernation we will give it a coating of wood preservative.      ::::6851095:3:::6851095:3:::6701923:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6145850:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5522492:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6781956:3:::6615749:3:::6615749:3:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6401477:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6758309:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::6146142:4:::6146142:4:::21963:4:::6794931:4:::6794931:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6600809:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6414449:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6748799:4:::6748799:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco garden peas::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::08.11.2009::::    Peas please Louise, I often have a packet of Tesco frozen garden peas in my freezer.   I think the packaging must have changed since this category was added as it is not such a lush green pack anymore. The product the same just Tesco has updated the pack  These garden peas are available in 1kg pack and in a 1.8kg bag. The 1kg bag costs 1.63, the 1.8kg bag    2.82 (   1.57 per kg) so if you have room the bigger bag works  out cheaper.I find a bag of peas handy to keep in the freezer as I can easily use as many as I need at any time. Peas are often the vegetable that will be eaten by children. (except my grandson ) Peas go well as a vegetable accompaniment to most meals. These Tesco garden peas are good ones, not hard bullet and tasteless. They are a fairly good bright green maybe not the smallest and sweetest frozen pea, but they are a good everyday pea. They taste quite sweet and pea like.  Frozen peas do not actually taste an awful lot like fresh peas really. Tesco garden peas are easy to eat stab them on your fork if you want to keep them from rolling off your plate onto the floor. As you get older your skill at keeping peas on your fork get better and you do not have to resort to a spoon as your child might. There is usually a good storage date on these frozen peas so they can be kept opened in the fridge for a long time. The pack /bag is a plastic one easier to open with scissors than trying to tear. If you store this pack in your freezer without using a freezer tie or clip you will get peas everywhere. So do use a freezer peg or a  paper covered wire. To cook these peas is easy just add some to a little water and microwave for a couple of minutes or cook on the hob in a saucepan with water added. For between 3 and 5 minutes Best cooked from frozen. Tesco warn you not to eat these peas raw. I like to add a sprig of fresh mint from my garden to these peas sometimes.These are quite a good pea to go with the Sunday roast. They are good to add a few to a casserole too I just pour a few of them into the casserole dish while it is cooking. There are 70kcal per 100g of these peas. You will need about 50g for a serving for most people. Would I recommend?  Yes these are an ok frozen pea     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5522492:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6758309:4:::6600809:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::21963:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5021331:4:::5021331:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6806235:4:::6378505:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6474927:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6755322:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6750576:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This cave is in the Cevennes the south of France. We arrived at area of the cave there was plenty of car parking.  When we got to the little visitors centre which and items such as crystals , key rings and postcards This is also a small caf    selling drinks and snacks to eat outside there are benches and chairs  overlooking the tarn we bought our tickets  the price adult E 8. 50 from 6 to 18 years E5.50 the price did include the guide. (You can also leave him a tip at the end) you can not walk around un accompanied. The cave is shut in the winter from late October or early November till the spring .check the site   http://www.gralon.net/tourisme/a-visiter/info-grotte-de-dargilan-meyrueis-19166.htm The tour we took was about 1 km. I seem to remember it took us about 1 hour The path was quite good although you did have to watch your step on the rocks and steps. There are rails to hold for safety. The caves are light by electric lightWhen we got there we had to wait about 20 minutes for the next tour. The tour begins at the cave entrance which is down a rocky path below the visitors centre. There are many more passageways and caves which the general public can not visit.   The path widens out to a large cave high and wide.The tour we took was about 1 km. I seem to remember it took us about  45 minutes to 1 hour The path was quite good although you did have to watch your step on the rocks and steps. There are rails to hold for safety. The caves were full of calcifications which madder it very attractive. his series of caves id often called the rose /pink cavers as some of the limestone has frerrous oxide in it Walking along the path the stalactites and stalagmites are quite fantastic, the guide does tell us all about them but in French, my French but good enough o translate so we just looked with awe and wonder. As we walked along we noted some of the calcifications had names like the tortoise, the minaret , macaroni, the elephants ear , with a bit of imagination I could identify these shapes (a bit like making picture out of cloud shapes ). One of the passages was made by a river and has speleothems (formations made by mineral deposit in a cave.) one a waterfall is huge. We left the cave at the same place we entered. The view from here across the Gorges de la Jonte is spectacular. I should like to return one day and explore this region furtherI enjoyed our cave visit well worth going into we took with us a 3 and a 6 year old and it was suitable for them. By the end the 3 year old was tired though The children particularly enjoyed the shaped rocks and the names given to them trying to see what shapes they could make out of the calcifications too.     ::::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6806114:4:::6806114:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6781956:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6145850:4:::6600809:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::3957:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5021331:4:::5021331:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6243305:4:::6757811:4:::6790827:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5567145:4:::5752942:4:::6799313:4:::6799313:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5816422:4:::6410840:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6803687:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6739162:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::21963:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio 33654 Loads Wagon::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::31.10.2009::::    Come on join me playing with the Brio train set again. This time it   s a loads wagon 33654 that I am playing with. The load   s wagon is a bright red. It is an open carriage suitable for transporting many things. This Brio wagon suitable for a child aged over 3 years old.This wagon measures 3.35 inches /8cm. The wagon base is beech wood the open carriage is red plastic. The side wall of the carriage can flip down by pressure on the side clips. In side the carriage there is a green metal cylinder this can be picked up by a magnetic crane. At the ends of the carriage are magnetic couplers. This carriage will be attracted to a brio train and can be pulled along the railway line. At one end of this wagon is a south magnet pole at the other end a north one so your child will need the carriage turned the right way for the engine to pull. If positioned the other way they will not attract if the weight inside the carriage is not too great, it will repel the magnet at the other side. This carriage will add extra fun to a brio set. Unfortunately this set comes with only one piece of magnetic load however my children being inventive will use other things such as small bricks, pasta, rice any small item really. This wagon is quite durable, but I can see the side clip getting worn and possibly broken eventually. I think this is a good addition to a Brio railway set. This wagon carriage costs    4.29p from Amazon. Its    3.95 at http://www.woodentoystore.co.uk , it is available at a lot of other places on or off line for the    4 to     5 mark.I really like Brio wooden train sets so do both my children at work and my grandson although at 6 nearly he does not play with them as often as he used to. I love to sit watch and listen to the children talking. They will spend ages moving the trains around picking up and unloading goods.So  would I recommend this toy ? Yes if your child has or is going to have Brio train track , trains or the brio compatible ones from other companies.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5285637:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6806114:4:::6806114:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6145850:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5522492:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5690767:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6797772:4:::6797772:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6410840:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6755322:4:::6617478:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::5368234:4:::5368234:4:::6290957:4:::6805476:4:::6805476:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5567145:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6739162:4:::6793897:4:::6793897:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5816422:4:::6803687:4:::6310942:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::21963:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5439461:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6750576:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

These sweets from Tesco come in a grey and white striped plastic bag with a  black oval proclaiming they are Tesco liquorice allsorts  . The ingredients are given on the bag,. These liquorice allsorts contain Gluten no nuts but can not be guaranteed nut free, they have wheat flour in and gelatine. So not suitable for a lot of people with allergies However I like these allsorts, there are a mixture of 5 sorts of allsorts in this bag there   s a soft liquorice bar with a soft centre there   s a solid liquorice bar too.. Then there   s a sort of jelly circle covers in sweet sprinkles a fondant wheel with a solid liquorice centre and a sliver of liquorice sandwiched between 2 fondant slices. My favourite has to be the solid liquorice. I am quite partial to the liquorice sandwich too, not so keen on the jelly round. These taste quite sweet especially the fondant parts. The liquorice tastes mild. I like these sweets when I get the urge for something sweet and liquorice flavoured and at 56p they are quite cheap     ::::5708451:3:::6806114:3:::6806114:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::6755322:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6198375:3:::6198375:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::21963:4:::6803687:4:::5335750:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6799313:4:::6799313:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I sometimes eat them as just a bowlful of these flakes with some skimmed milk, but more usually I mix them with either special k fruit varieties sometimes I use the cheaper own brand   flakes with dried fruit.Tesco healthy living bran flakes cost    159 for a box containing 1 kg.There are 335 kcal per 100g a bowl serving 30g 160 kcal. These bran flakes do contain Wheat and salt for full info look at the packet or the Tesco website. I did a quick comparison of price and calories of other bran flakes in Tesco   s.Brand name calories price weightTesco health living bran flakes per 100g 335k cal per 30g with 125ml semi skim milk 160kcal    1.59   0.79p 1kg500gKellogg   s Bran Flakes   Per 100g 326  per 30g with 125ml semi skimmed milk 157kcal    1.76 500gTesco Value Bran Flakes  Per 100g 335  per 30g with 125ml semi skimmed milk 160kcal 0.78p 750gNow any bran flakes are about the most boring cereal you can get.*Looks. These Tesco healthy living ones look much like any other bran flake , They are a darkish brown thin  sort of irregular  elongated circle they  have crinkly edges .*Texture. The texture rough the surfaces are sort of crinkly. They are crisp will crunch in your mouth. They do get stuck on your mouth roof and between the teeth, but a good swig of tea sorts that out.*Taste?  Neutral, you could not find much in the taste to offend anyone. The do have a slightly stronger wheatier bran flavour than the good old basic cornflakes. *Added interest.As I said I add a little fruit cereal to these bran flakes to make them more interesting. I sometimes add  some fresh fruit to them too*Recipe  For many years now I have made an apple crunch pudding from these and other bran flakes or cornflakes using this recipe 2 large cooking apples cut thinly or pre stewed with mixed spice or cinnamon a little brown sugar to taste, put this mix in the bottom of a dish. Then mix up about 75g flour, 150b crushed bran flakes 40g brown sugar blend with a heaped tablespoon of margarine till it looks like crispy breadcrumbs. Pour this mix onto the apples and bake in an over at about 120c for half an hour.Serve it hot, its good with plain or vanilla yoghurt.*Would I recommend these bran flakes ? well yes as much as any other, but my old dad said you may as well eat the cardboard box they come in.     ::::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5631861:3:::5631861:3:::6789555:3:::6778409:3:::6740155:3:::6776473:3:::6776473:3:::6802048:3:::6802048:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::21963:4:::6145850:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5522492:4:::6804844:4:::6804844:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5567145:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6609678:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6657747:4:::6729329:4:::6803687:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6797772:4:::6797772:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6005265:4:::6005265:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6760153:4:::6760153:4:::6758309:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5717149:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::6739162:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Bahlsen hit biscuits::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::29.10.2009::::    I recently bought a packet of Bahlsen hit biscuits. I have one left in the blue packet I am eating this as I write my review. These biscuits are presented in a blue packet which has a picture of a couple of the biscuits on it , there are 250 g per packet. The biscuit is a sandwich biscuit, so I am effectively eating 2 biscuits. The biscuit is a golden brown circle with fluted edges. It has the word hit written in the middle. This biscuit is sandwiched together with a chocolate cream filling. My biscuit being in an opened packet for ages is a bit soft but I know that when just opened or kept in air free pot these biscuits are crisp to bite., The biscuits taste is good it is buttery, reminds me of a rich tea biscuit. The chocolate filling is a mild flavour does not over power the biscuit, it is a smooth creamy chocolate cocoa flavour, very pleasant. I like these biscuits while they are sweet they are not over sweet, perfect to accompany a cup of tea or coffee. These biscuits do contain wheat flour and skimmed milk powder. I anticipate that you check ingredients if you have allergies anyway. As you might expect lots of calories, 138 per biscuit. I bought my biscuits from Tesco where they cost 72p ocado is selling them for the same price asda 1p cheaper at 71p Bahlsen biscuits are a German product from Hanover .Bahlsen food company was founded in 1889 by Hermann Bahlsen. The family do still control this business, with Herman s grandson Werner at the head.

I am playing with an Austrian footballer today.  This player is  only 7cm /2 .3/4 in tall. He is a plastic player, a Playmobil toy. Playmobil make a range of footballers from several different countries. These Austrian Playmobil football players are suitable for a child aged over 4 years old *What does he look like?This Austrian toy player has brown hair, brown dot eyes and a smiling mouth. He is wearing the Austrian strip, black socks black shorts red and white shirt a black scarf /neckerchief /cravat thingy round his neck. Included in the pack are several numbers for him to wear on his shirt so you could buy lots of these footballers and make a team with different numbers on.Now how does he move? Well this player can move his legs from his hip, his arms move from the shoulders. He has c cup grasping hands. So yes he can be moved to play a stilted game. This player comes with a stand so you can prop him up while he waits in the reserves. A ball comes with this player, and he has a paper goal target sheet so he can play football at anytime.  Durability. This football player is quite durable should last many matches. Playmobil are great toys well made and have play value. You could always use these toys as cake toppers on a green iced cake for a football mad child /or adult. They are always useful when you need an extra Playmobil man for different games.Playmobil has certainly developed a long way since it was playpeople when I was younger. They make many people and play sets. I really would recommend these toys as some of the best.    *Price.

       " '5247778::::Royal Doulton Bunnykins Cereal Bowl::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::26.10.2009::::    I was looking for a set of crockery for a new baby and recalled the Bunnykins ones my daughter had as a birth present.  The Royal Doulton company was formed in 1853 went into receivership in January this year 2009. I am sure Bunnykins products will still be made though. Today I am talking about the infant Bunnykins bowl, a basic bowl shape I believe called Albion shape.  This is a 6 inch diameter cereal bowl. There is also a baby bowl available this has a flattened lip all the way around the bowl . Over the years there have been several Bunnykins picture designs inside the bowls the scene  inside the bowl has changing  designs rotating over the years .there is a kite one which is the one my daughter has , there is one with the bunny children playing with knitting wool, then there is   the bunnykins in bunk beds. There are special Christmas design ones too. Each of the different designs has a row of bunnies running around the inside circumference of the bowl regardless of the interior design . The Bunnykins bowls I am talking about are made with a fine bone china. There are bunnykins products made with Melamine too. Although the melamine Bunnykins bowls are more practical there is something special about the bowls made of china . You may wish to keep your bunnykins bowl and not let baby use it. My baby did use hers , not everyday but when I wanted to make cereal or pudding a bit special , as she got older she did use this bowl more often until she decided the design a bit babyish then as a teenager she fell in love with the rabbit design again and I think she took this bowl when she moved out . The china this bowl is made from is lovely, the bowl looks and feels good,  it is as durable as other fine china items. The designs and rabbits on the bowl are delightful. The rabbits busy doing everyday things. I used to use them as an incentive for my daughter to eat, come on eat your pudding and you will see the bunny.  Royal Doulton planned its new nursery china at its factory in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The daughter of the factory s general manager Cuthbert Bailey created illustrations that could be transfer-printed on to the china. Barbara  was a nun  and the tale goes that she could only work on her designs at night without anyone knowing as  the convent s Reverend Mother disapproved. Sister Mary Barbara drew the rabbits dressed as people in human situations. These really are endearing pictures. Royal Doulton introduced Bunnykins in 1934.  In 1939 the production of Bunnykins stopped due to the war. They were   reintroduced after the war with Walter Hayward, one of Royal Dolton   s Art Directors, doing the art in the same style .Sister Mary Barbara  died in  2003. These Bunnykins bowls and other Bunnykins ware can be purchased from  shops such as John Lewis and on line at many other places . http://www.kingsandqueens.org.uk is selling the bowl in the picture for    8.00 I think iy generally retails for    10.00  http://www.mulberryhall.co.uk has the shiningStarsCerealBowl.html With bunnykins riding his rocking horse western style with his whip in his hand for    11.75, Bunnykins bowls are very collectable some old rare ones worth quite a bit of money. Under the bowl of some of the bunnykins range is a Royal Daulton stamp from this you can tell the age although apparently not all have a stamp on for some reason.These bowls are beautiful, if looking for a birth, christening present I think these are very acceptable     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6779286:4:::6779286:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5816422:4:::6789555:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6410840:4:::6146142:4:::6146142:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6378505:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6778409:4:::5362774:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bob The Builder Friction Splasher::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::25.10.2009::::    Bob the Builder Friction Splasher. Let me tell you about the Bob the builder Splasher friction toy we have,  This toy is a born to play friction vehicle. Born to play make many Bob the builder friction vehicles at work we have most of them for me to play with, with the children..This friction vehicle is about 25 cm long comparable to the other born to play friction vehicles. It is a look alike for Splasher from Bob the builder books and films. Splasher is bright yellow. This is an open vehicle no roof over the front and back seats. There is a plastic window screen, below which are Splasher googly eyes. The engine grid makes it look like the vehicle has a face. It looks quite a serious face I think. Splasher has 2    go fast    stripes on his yellow side, or are they supposed to represent water? Splasher has 6 wheels. This vehicle is am amphibious one, it will float on water. .  If the mechanism at the back of the vehicle is twisted it will charge the propellers move on waterSo it is suitable for both, land or water play.  This is really quite a good toy as are all the born to play friction vehicles. Splasher moves well will travel on his own if children give him some friction. This is a very durable toy.  Bob figures will sit in the seats so they can go to work. This toy is good for children practising their eye hand coordination and manipulative skills.

I have an assortment of colouring crayons some from stART. These crayons in my draw are a couple of years old, I am not sure where I got them from but it would have been in the high street.

These colouring pencils are available in a 24 pack, these are in a blue card package which has colourful butterflies printed on it. These colouring pencils are long thin ones about 18cm long by/2 a cm in diameter. These pencil crayons have a hexagonal barrel this is a natural colour with England start colouring and a number printed on it. The end 3 cms of the pencil is coloured the same colour as the lead to help you identify the colour easily. Hexagonal barrelled pencils are good as they do not roll away. These are quite good to hold. They are not ideal for a tiny tot as they are long, better to get a short colouring pencil for a young child. There are 12 colours available 2 of each in the 24 pack they are red, black, dark blue, light blue, dark green, light green, yellow orange, purple, crimson, dark brown, and white. The    lead    does not break very easily  The colour they produce on paper is a good strong one. The    lead    being quite soft The line they make is quite a thin one this is good for fine drawing but not so much for block colouring.

       " '5247778::::Play-Doh 4 Tubs Original::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::24.10.2009::::    Playdoh by Hasbro is a fantastic modelling compound for children aged over 3 . It has been available for many years now.   New colours and sets have been introduced. I notice sets of 4 tubs of original Playdoh is available.Playdoh is non toxic However, Hasbro warns those allergic to wheat gluten or specific food dyes may have an allergic reaction to this product.These 4 tubs are presented together in a brightly coloured cardboard sheath are small ones each containing 6 oz of dough.. You will find the colours of the dough vary from pack to pack one may have red, blue, yellow and white   another red, orange blue and green   another pack purple yellow green and red. Each tub has a coloured lid which corresponds to the colour of the doh inside. On the base of each tub, Play-Doh Tub Original features a shape maker and animal print. There is sufficent dough inside each pot for your child to play with and make a model. The playdoh in these tubs is brightly coloured, it feels lovely soft not greasy . If you smell it, it has that vanilla smell which is pleasant.  Playdoh is suitable for a child aged 3 and over,It is a great sensory toy I encourage my students with poor finer control and poor muscle control in their hands to hold it and squeeze it in their hands, I roll it in a ball and encourage them to poke their fingers in it. I flatten it out and encourage them  to stretch their fingers out and make a hand print in the doh. Playdoh is also useful for granny or granddad to exercise their arthritic fingers. Playdoh can be modelled by hand or use a rolling pin and tools to make shapes. I have never known a child not like playdoh and I have worked and played with 100   s of children using playdoh.Roll the playdoh up after use put it back in the pot  the lid will create a good seal and the playdoh can be used many more times . You can buy a pack of these original Playdoh tubs for    4.99 at http://www.xs-stock.co.uk/products Amazon had these but they seem to be unavailable there. If you can not get this 4 pack of 6oz original Playdoh there are many, many other suitable Playdoh tubs available.Playdoh is a clean medium for model making . You could take it to aunties house for your child to play with and be reassured it will not make a mess unless dropped on the carpet and trodden in. To remove Playdoh from the carpet let it dry out then brush it ith a hard stiff brush. After sweeping up the loosened doh you may need to wash the area with soap and cold water, scrubbing the area with a hard scrubbing brush is good too  I t is probably best to play with this doh on a non carpeted area. Would I recommend these tubs odd oh ? Yes they are a good size and playdoh is such a great modelling medium for toddlers .      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6145850:4:::5907093:4:::5907093:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5459724:4:::5335750:4:::5255134:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6758309:4:::5790028:4:::5714912:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6804001:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6378505:4:::5362774:4:::6748799:4:::6748799:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6699566:4:::5891:4:::5891:4:::6789555:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5552133:4:::5552133:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Paper Mate 2020 Stick Ball Pen::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::22.10.2009::::    Its amazing the variety of simple stick pens I have in my stationary draw next to my computer. When tidying up the other day I came across some Papermate stick 2020 pens.This ball point pen is available in red, blue, black and green, they are available in either a fine or medium nib. The fine one giving a line 0.3 mm width, the medium line 0.4 mm width. These pens have an outer casing of the same colour as the ink inside you can not see how much ink is left through the pen. The lid which has a moulded clip to hook the pen on a paper or onto your jacket pocket is the same colour. These pens measure 14.1/2 cm. The barrel of these pens is circular and they easily roll onto the floor of your desk. The colour of the ink is a good bold colour. They write well. I have used many.The pen is easy enough to hold and use, rolls between the finger easier than one of the ball pens with flattened sides. You can buy these pens in many stationer   s  from http://www.staples.co.uk/ a pack of 50 will cost    7.49 at Amazon a pack of 50 will cost    5.52. I can not find packs of less than 50 on line but I feel sure you can buy single ones or small packets in the high street.I am not sure  where we got the 3 or 4 Papermate 2020 stick pens we have, they are possible ones my husbands students left on the classroom floor. My hubby picks them up and keeps them in his classroom desk drawer for when his pupils whinge    please sir I have not got a pen   Although I am not sure how long these papermate 20/20 stick pens have been made, Papermate pens first were produced in the 1940   s as a product of Frawley Pen Company.  In 1949 they got their name from when the company produced an ink that would dry instantly Since then they were bought up by Gillette who sold them to Newell Rubbermaid in 2000 them as part of their stationary products group. Papermate also make this pan as a click variety when you click a clip and the nib retracts up the barrel. So how do I rate these stick pens? Well much the same as a lot of other stick pens such as those by Bic and Steadtler     ::::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6701923:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5207685:4:::5207685:4:::6304539:4:::6304539:4:::21963:4:::6371369:4:::6371369:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5752942:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6146142:4:::6146142:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::6752042:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::5551323:4:::6410840:4:::5567145:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6506577:4:::6776473:4:::6776473:4:::6789555:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6750576:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6799313:4:::6799313:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6796848:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6780393:4:::6780393:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6802779:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5717149:4:::6474927:4:::6581444:4:::6581444:4:::6797772:4:::6797772:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6777903:4:::6804001:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

These coloured bricks can be used to represent grass, hay, straw. The animals do not have moving parts, but the base /feet of them are holes that will fit into the studs of the bricks.  The horse has a stud in his back so some of the Duplo people can sit on and ride him. The man has those c shaped cup hands that will hold other suitable Duplo pieces. The flower has a stud in the centre so will fit onto a Duplo brick. These Duplo animals are bright plastic rounded shapes easy to hold and fit.

       " '5247778::::Sacla Tomato & Chilli Paste::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.10.2009::::    Feeling lazy again after a hard day at work I decided to cook an east meal . I boiled a pan of water, opened a value pack of pasta. The pasta is in a bag of 500 g. Then I found a little jar (190g), of  Sacla Tomato   Chilli Paste 190g. My pasta cooked for about 15 minutes. I then drained and rinsed the pasta with boiling water. Then I twisted the cap off the glass jar and poured in the thick sauce.Next I stirred the Sacla Tomato   Chilli Paste into the pasta and stirred to cover all the pasta. I reheated the pasta on the hob while I stirred the sauce in the pasta covered this amount of pasta quite well. I served some of the pasta in sauce onto 2 plates one for hubby one for me and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. We sat down to eat. This was a tasty easy quick meal. The tomato flavour good and just enough of a chilli sting for me. I preferred it to the fiery chilli paste I used a couple of weeks ago. This was a flavoursome pasta. I will most certainly buy it again. I need not have used all the sauce at once as it will keep in the fridge for a week or so. I used all the sauce as I thought I would either freeze the remainder or have it cold for lunch at work the next day like a pasta salad. There was enough pasta for 4 good servings. Just looked at the jar and there are 402 kcal per 100g.   This paste would be ideal if stirred into a casserole to spice it up.

This glove does protect me from those fierce thorns it has a suede leather palm. This glove has a reinforced cuff which helps stop my wrists from getting scratched. The back of the glove is a breathable mesh fabric, which stops my hands getting hot and sweaty, A although the colour of a gardening glove does not really bother me this one is grey suede with a purple cuff and mesh fabric. I find these gloves quite comfortable to wear they are not over stiff like some other gardening gloves and they do protect me from scratches and thorns.  I expect to be wearing them quite a bit this month as I have some pruning to do.

       " '5247778::::BiC Cristal Ball Pen::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::12.10.2009::::     I was inspired after tidying up my stationary draw to write a review on Bic crystal classic ball point pen. I have a red and a blue Bic ball point pen at 141/2 cm they are slightly longer than the Staedtler pen I wrote about recently.   This Bic pen like the Staedtler one has a clear plastic barrel . You can see the ink and how much is left through the barrel. This pen is hexaganol shaped so it does not roll off your desk. This hexagonal shaped barrel is easy to hold and control for your writing.  This Bic pen has a medium nib which is made of brass with a tungsten carbide ball. These Bic pens are available in blue, red, black, red, and green. At the end of the pen is a stopper which is the same colour as the ink and there is a ventilated cap of matching colour too.These pens are good to use I do not have a problem with smudging or ink blobs with these. These pens are ideal for school, home or office use. They are available in many stationers on or off line at http://www.caboodle.co.uk/ you can buy a box of 50 for    8.41 (sale price)      19.50 previous price. At http://www.ryman.co.uk a single pen is 35p. So as you can see they are not an expensive item.A short history lesson.~~~~~~~~~The first ball point pen was a ball point marker, a leaky pen invented by   John Loud in 1888.Biro invented a ball pen  it was patented in 1938 . A man called Micheal Bich had a buisiness making partys for fountain pens ,in 1950 he created his own ball point pen. He shortened the name to Bic and the Bic cristal ball point pen is now a popular pen which lasts for ages. Would I recomend ? Yes  well I am not sure which brand of ball point pen is the best but these seem to be a good  pen.I wonder how many of you now will look at your ball point to see what brand it is ? Bic has the name along the barrel .      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5719918:3:::6740155:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::6797968:3:::6797968:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6701923:3:::6458724:3:::6458724:3:::6657747:3:::6789555:3:::6474927:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6874204:4:::6874204:4:::5522492:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5505555:4:::5505555:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::5496122:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6506577:4:::5567145:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::22279:4:::22279:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6786736:4:::6786736:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6783831:4:::6801771:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::VTech My First Music Maker::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::11.10.2009::::    I have played with this v tech first music player at work alongside 3 to 5 year old special needs pupils.  This is a baby musical interactive toy suitable for those aged 6 months upwards.     This toy is not a large one I do not have it at hand to measure, but it is a good compact size so would be easy to take along in the pushchair.It is made of plastic it has a molded yellow plastic handle that you or your baby could hold to carry it. The centre of this toy has a yellow star with a smiley face, this lights up when any of the surrounding buttons are pushed. This also makes drumming sounds and says a few 1, 2, 3 counting phrases too.  There is an on off and volume control switch on the front just below the star.  Notes and numbers 1-3 are printed in white on the blue surround around the star.To the right facing you on the white moulded plastic are 3 small buttons orange, blue and red. These have pictures of a guitar, orange button, a piano blue button, and bells red button. The buttons are easy to press and when done so will play a few tunes and notes from the illustrated instrument. You can easily change the melody by pressing one of the other buttons.On the left facing you there is a red disc which turns and makes scratching drumming sound effects.Turning the disc while the melodies are playing speeds up or slows down the song which is being played. Above this is a blue knob this can be wobbled and activates cymbal sounds. The music from the coloured buttons on the opposite side can still be heard while this blue knob is being usedThis toy needs 2AA batteries. When the toy is not being used it will automatically switch off saving those batteries It is a durable toy and needs to be as baby will often drop this on the floor.This toy gives the incentive to practice those fine motor skills. It has a variety of textures sounds and casuals. These will stimulate sensory development.I think this is a fair interactive sensory toy for a baby.

       " '5247778::::Amaryllis::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::15.10.2002::::    Amaryllis /hippeastrumAmaryllis belladonna is a bulbous plant and, comes from South Africa it has 6 to 12 flowers on a solid flower stem it has only one species in its genus.  However it gets confused with Hippeastrum (scientific name), Amaryllis   is its common name.The hippeastrum comes from South Africa also, and has 4 to 6 large flowers on a hollow stem. It also is a bulbous plant. The Hippeastrum has several species.There are a lot of cultivars developed from hybridising several hippeastrum species.Amaryllis is easy to grow..I have grown them myself. They are a bright, bold, brassy table centrepiece. They grow to a height of 16   8211;24 inches 40- 60 cm the flowers measure 8 inches, 25cm in diameter.I have bought them as presents for aunties and my mum they are always well received. They can be bought in boxes with a pot and compost in it ready to put together and plant. I cannot remember how much they cost, about a fiver I think.How to grow.Pot some compost in the bottom of the pot. The pot must be a little bigger than the bulb, a confined space suits them.Next place the bulb on top of the compost with its nose (bit where the leaves grow from Opposite end to the roots) just peeping over the top of the pot. Keep it central. Now put compost around the bulb fill the pot up not quite to the top. This makes watering easy.Water but do not over water keep it moist not wet. The bulb will grow best at room teperature 68 f 20 c 6to 10 weeks from planting the flower will bloom.When the flowers fade cut them off.

       " '5247778::::Staedtler 430 Stick Ball Pen::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::07.10.2009::::    I had to write a note today and I used a Steadtler 430m. stick pen. Looking through my stationary drawer and discovered several staedtler stick pens. Steadtler 430 m stick pens are available in Blue, red, black and green ink. These pens are as you can see from the picture have a clear plastic shaft/barrel , This is 13cm long, just less than a cm in diameter. The shaft is a hexagon with 6 straight sides this is good as it mean the pen does not easily roll of the table. You can see the ink through the plastic, its not easy to distinguish the colour from a full pen though..  At one end of the pen is a coloured stopper at the other a strong metal ball point nib. There is a plastic lid which has a clip on it so you can clip it onto the edge of your paper or jacket pocket. This lid is coloured to match the ink. This lid is also ventilated to make it safer if it gets swallowed I guess.     These stick pens seem quite good. I can not tell you exactly how long they would last , but mine seem to last a long time writing lots . I have not known the ink from these pens to blotch or blob.The nib does not scratch The STAEDTLER    stick 430 M which is shown in the picture of this review has a medium nib with a 1.0mm Tip making a 0.35mm line. This is fine for most writing jobs. This stick pen will write almost anywhere, it has an airplane-safe feature provides an automatic pressure equalisation which prevents the pen from leakage while you are on the plane. Sadly it won   t write upside down for long. These pens are quite inexpensive. A box of ten from Amazon will cost you about    1.85 the RRP being    3.10. Saddler also make stick pens   with a fine nib these are encased in a yellow plastic that is not see through.Would I recommend these pens ? .Yes they are a good ball point pen  for writing with.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5522492:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::6145850:3:::5646482:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5719918:4:::6792712:4:::6792712:4:::6801920:4:::6801920:4:::21963:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6776727:4:::6776727:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5719974:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::6781956:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::5335750:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6737129:4:::6737129:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6410840:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6693128:4:::5717149:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6702036:4:::5362774:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6657747:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6789555:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Britains Big Square Bales::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::05.10.2009::::     I rarely see the square ? rectangular straw bales in the fields these days farmers seem to prefer the bigger circular ones, However the rectangular/ quot; square quot; bales are seen occasionally. The square refers to the square end face of the bales where as I always think of them as rectangular thinking of the side faces. Britain s is a manufacturer of realistic toy/model farming equipment and sundries on a 1:32 scale. The have been making realistic farming and other vehicles for many years. They produce a pack of 6 square bales. These  quot;square quot; bales measure 7 x 3.5 x 2.5. These bales are made of  either green or yellow plastic which has combed sides to make it resemble the texture of hay/straw.  I am more familiar with the yellow variety.These plastic bales are good representations and are good if you wish to promote farm play or produce a static harvest farm scene. These square bales are compatible with Britain s square balers. They will also fit on Britain s farm tractor trailers too. Your children could pretend to gather in the straw and move it on the trailers them give it to the animals for food or bedding. Might be a good idea to have some real straw/hay to play with alongside these plastic bales. Playing with farm toys and these bales helps children gain an understanding of the world. These bales always evoke my memories of playing with real straw bales when I was a child . Making houses out of them , climbing on them, getting told off because I might loosen them and spread the hay everywhere . I love playing with the children and the toy farming equipment the animals and the sundries like the hay bales. Britains do produce the circular bales too if you prefer them . These Britain s square plastic bales of straw are suitable for children aged 3 and over, I think they are ideal for a 4, 5-6 year old.      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6145850:3:::6754009:3:::6754009:3:::5646482:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6800001:3:::6800001:3:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::6797820:4:::6797820:4:::21963:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5335750:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6751685:4:::6778987:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6378505:4:::5567145:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6243535:4:::6243535:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lotus 2 Ply Napkins::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::04.10.2009::::    I am getting fed up with my products that I have requested this last month not being added. So I perused for an item that I knew about to write on.  I recognised these Christmas napkins as ones I have seen and used at Christmas parties.  Yes I know its still a bit early to be seriously considering Christmas. However I checked on line to see where you could buy these napkins for and notice http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk has them for 1.79 a pack.There are 3 designs available here although Lotus make many more designs of napkins suitable for Christmas and other occasions. Each pack contains 20 napkins of one design. These napkins are Christmas colours reds green and gold. One pack has a gold Christmas tree with gold stars surrounding it on a red back ground, one pack has a border of green holly leaves a few dark red berries on a red background with a centre panel of red and green stripes. The last pack has a border of gold stars surrounding gold holly leaves these are on a pale gold back ground. I personally have used both the gold and red holly leaf design. These napkins are a fairly good quality 2 ply paper quite thick and soft, they do not tear easily. These napkins are a square they measure about 33cm x 33cm average size for a table napkin. These napkins both look good on a table and do the job they are made for well enough.  They are handy for putting on a knee so that they will catch that part jelly, tuck them into your child   s clothing neck to mop up those spillages, or discreetly dab around the mouth to wipe up those mince pie crumbs that get stuck in your moustache. They can be used to dab at the red wine that had dripped onto the table cloth.Yes these lotus napkins in the designs here are a good napkin although if I am buying for home use this Christmas I will probably buy a plain pack of red or green ones festive season colours but 20 Christmas pattered ones is a few too many and the left over ones wasted, the plain ones I can use at any occasion. Now how would you fold and display these napkins on the table?  a fan , a crown , a Fleur de Lys Goblet Fold?   Its up to you for ideas and some advice on how to fold napkins there are several sites on line one is  http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to-lotus-napkin-fold.

       " '5247778::::Jiffy Padded Bag Envelopes::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::30.09.2009::::    I received a DVD in a jiffy bag recently opened the bag carefully and put the bag ready to reuse with about 20 other old jiffy bags I have ready for recycling. Actually I am not sure that all of them are genuine jiffy bags but they are the same sort of thing. Jiffy bags made by Jiffy have been available for several years now I think they go back to the 1950   s. Jiffy bags are handy padded envelope bags that can be bought in a variety of sizes  some as small as  to 164 x 285mm,  then several sizes upwards to 247 x 387mm, probably even larger ones available. The original bag is a golden brown heavy duty paper. The padded filling can be as simple as shredded paper. The envelope closures   are one you peel to reveal a sticky surface this will then stick to seal the bag and contents. Some jiffy bags are filled with a macerated fibre paper that cushions the contents. Some Jiffy bags have a lining of bubble wrap for protecting goods. Jiffy bags can also be purchased in white GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE and RED. And  for that extra special mailing red black silver and gold  metallic colours are available . I have used and received jiffy bags containing   CD   S   , DVD   S and plastic bottles .  Jiffy bags do give that little extra protection to goods. However I would not pack and post very fragile items certainly not glass ones. Jiffy bags are best for flat items too as with the  handling sharp corners might pierce the bag.

       " '5247778::::Royal Worcester Classic White Mugs::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::29.09.2009::::    A porcelain factory was established in Worcester in 1751 and gained the name of a fine manufacturer of tableware. The name Royal added as it made porcelain for royal tables. Vases and other objects are also made. In November 2008 the firm went into administration and bought up by Portmeirion. Royal Worcester have made many good items including these classic white mugs. I have drunk out of these several times when visiting a friend   s house. These white mugs are made of porcelain. They are neither, a thin bone china mug or a thick pottery one the thickness somewhere between.  These mugs are a classic straight sided shape. There is a very slight smooth lip to the cup. The handle is well positioned and a good size to grip easily, each one will contain 0.34L of drink. This is not a really exciting mug, but being white it will go with all colour schemes.  I think in general I prefer a pattered mug but I do like a white inner as it is clean.Drinking a mug of tea or coffee is a pleasurable experience from these mugs.  These mugs are microwave and dishwasher safe so a cold cup of tea can be reheated and the dirty ones washed either by hand or dishwasher.These mugs can be bought at shops selling crockery on and off line. On line I note they are available at http://www.cookingtime.co.uk for    12.00 (sale price) for a set of 4. They are    24.35 for a set of 4 at http://www.chinaetc.co.ukWould I recommend?

One was this yellow hat which has BOSS written on the front. I work with 5 year olds and it is good for the size of their heads. It would be fine for a child aged between 3 and 7.This hat is made of a strong firm yellow plastic. It looks very similar to the real thing.  There is a ridge down the centre front to back and it is shaped with as front peak Since Bob the builder has been on our screens playing at builders has become popular dressing up to look just like Bob. Children have however always been fascinated by building site, the equipment, diggers and trucks. So this hat is a good addition to their imaginary play scenarios.Several of the children in my class choose to wear this hat while they played. Children from all generations have always enjoyed dressing up. This hat is a prop for imaginary play. You could use this hat to explain to children why a builder might wear a hat and the risks of getting banged on the head. Shame my granddaughter was not wearing this last week when she fell of a computer chair onto the fire surround. She had a cut on her head that needed some glue at the hospital Would I recommend this hat? Yes it   s a good one should last many play hours .

       " '5247778::::Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Rock-a-Stack::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::27.09.2009::::    Let me tell you about the fisher price rock    a- stack. This toy is basically a pole on a base that your child stacks rings. There are many similar stacking toys available from different toy makers we have one of these in the early year s dept of the special school I work in. Fisher price has made this toy since 19 60 .I believe maybe slightly updated now but still the same basic toy. Fisher price must have sold 1000 s of this toy as I have seen it in many homes and childcare centres. Fisher price make good durable toys. The Fisher Price rock-a- stack is made out of a durable plastic. The Rock-a- stack toy is easy to wash to keep germ free. The white base has a curved base that will enable baby rock the toy from side to side. This toy however will stand upright on its curved base; there is a small flat area. A white plastic pole is fitted into the base and this stands upright. There are 5 hoops with this toy for stacking on. These are all different bright primary colours the smallest top one having a pattern on it. Each hoop is a slightly different size the largest fitting on first at the bottom of the pole the smallest last at the top of the pole. The smallest hoop has one side transparent with a few coloured swirls and has 3 beads safely enclosed inside it. These hoops are suitable for baby to use as a teething ring , when baby is at the age he/she will be playing with this toy he/she will be teething everything goes in his/her mouth . The rings are not a solid plastic they are a soft squidgy plastic very chewable. This toy is a safe toy. What baby will learn while playing with this toy? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This toy is bright and cheerful it will stimulate baby s visual senses. The feel of this toy will stimulate baby s touch. Baby will bat the toy and see it rock from side to side encouraging and developing gross motor skills. Grasping and placing the rings helps baby develop fine motor skills. Baby will sort the rings and place them on the pole learning to solve the problems of fitting them onto the ring and discovering which one fits next. Baby will learn about size and the different colours. If you sit and play with your baby you can help their language development and help them start to learn names for colours. Your baby is starting to learn right from the second they are born this toy is a good one to encourage learning and understanding. We do use similar stacking toys with special needs children as they do help them develop an understanding of shape and size and helps those with limited movement.

This box is good for storing them in the desk drawThere are red, blue, green, black in the 4 pack with  orange and purple in the 6 pack. Each of the pens is a silver colour with black writing on it. The caps are colours that correspond to the ink colour. The pen nibs are available in bullet 2mm wide mark  or chisel tip 2 or 5 mm size mark for whichever you prefer to make your mark with . These pens are quite good giving a good colour mark.  They contain a water based ink. They seem to last a long time too.  This might be partly due to the fact that it is possible for these pens to lie uncapped for days at a time, without drying up.  Also when extremely heavy writing pressure is applied, the tip remains locked in place and cannot be pushed back into the barrelThese pens do not bleed when used on paper and they will not leak on the airplane they have automatic pressure equalization.

Looks like they wil last for another year. I have had these black seed trays a year or two nowYou can buy a pack of 8 quite cheaply at B Q they cost    1.98 for 8 trays, that   s just less than 25p each.Size~~. These seed trays are Length (cm): 37.5 /14.8in,  Width (cm): 23/ 9.1 in depth 5cm/2in. This is a fairly standard size for a seed tray quite a good size really. Material~~~These are made of a thin but rigid black plastic.  Drainage~~~~ There are a number of small holes punched into the bottom of these seed trays  Durability~~~~ These trays are strong enough to last several years with several sowings. You do need to care of them though storing them stacked together for next year.  The plastic is fairly easy to tear and damage. Use~~~~~ Well these are quite handy for sowing seeds into fill with a suitable compost sow seeds as directed on packets , Also good for transplanting , thinning those little seedlings into . . After use wash them drain dry them and store for next time. I nearly filled my seed tray with seed compost sowed my lettuce seeds thinly. Then I covered them up with some more potting compost. Now to water them. Time to go into the house for a cup of tea, you going to join me . ~~~~~~~~ You are quite young now in my day before plastic seed trays that you can buy cheaply from  B  Q  my dad had wooden seed trays , I still have some of them that I use now . I think he may have bought some , but I know he made his own too, bits of wood he found around from old  things and he nailed them into a tray . Sometimes instead of a seed tray I will use egg boxes they are great for peas  . Old plastic fruit trays are useful too my favorite is  plastic mushroom trays , in fact I have grown seeds and plants in many strange plastic containers. But for a basic cheap seed tray these B Q ones do the job just fine.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5295459:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::3957:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6792895:4:::5335750:4:::5690767:4:::6778987:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::5816422:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::6781956:4:::5261772:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6797968:4:::6797968:4:::20229:4:::20229:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Betterware Cracker Keeper with Drawer::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::19.09.2009::::    I like a crisp fresh cracker with my cheese. I got fed up with soft crackers as the tin I kept them in was not airtight. We often get a Betterware catalogue left on the doorstep. I rarely order from them but occasionally look through the pages top see what is available. Earlier this year when I was skimming the pages of loo cleaner and sandwich boxes I noted the cracker keeper. Now this cracker keeper is a white cloudy translucent plastic .like Tupperware container. The shape the same as a Jacobs cream cracker packet but slightly larger it is 21cmx10.5. It has a blue plastic fairly airtight push on lid.Taking the lid off there is a removable translucent blue sliding drawer.I had a pack of Tesco cream crackers available when I received my cracker keeper so I placed the wrapped crackers in the tray . They sat there beautifully a perfect fit. I pushed the draw into the cracker keeper and placed it tidily in my store cupboard. Later that evening hubby and I were sat watching a film and during the advert break we had a drink and I got out the cheese and my new cracker keeper , I easily took the blue lid of the keeper and slid the draw some of the way. I tore the seal on the cracker pack and took some to eat with my cheese .After we removed the crackers I pushed the remaining ones into the keeper and put the lid on. Back into my store went the crackers for a few days till I fancied another one.  I find this cracker keeper good it does keep the crackers crisp. It   s the perfect size for fitting in a pack of crackers, not only have I kept the square crackers in my keeper but also round water biscuits. I have two cracker keepers I use the other to keep a pack of sweet biscuits in I have ginger nuts in mine now. As well as keeping biscuits and crackers crisp this cracker keeper will stop them getting broken in the store cupboard I hate buying a pack of biscuits putting them away then finding because they have been dropped or squashed between the beans that the crackers are broken. The plastic this keeper is made from is rigid enough to stop cracker crushing. Another benefit of keeping your crackers in a keeper is that   it also keeps them neat and tidy not taking up more space than they need. If this cracker keeper gets dirty Just wash in warm soapy water, do not put it in the dishwasher. Since it   s for keeping dry crackers in it will not get really dirty anyway. So a quick rinse will do. So how much does a betterware cracker keeper cost? It costs    3.99 You can buy it from a Betterware  distributor or online at http://www.betterware.co.uk/productdetails.aspx?pid=035328 cid=102 language=en-GB Would I recommend ?

In general I prefer plain chocolate to milk chocolateMc Vities are now owned by united biscuit, as are so many other biscuit makes. Mc Vities started making  digestives in 1925. The people in the UK apparently collectively eat over 52 of these biscuits a second. Since then  chocolate biscuits have been manufactures  . When I was a nipper  Macvities only made the milk chocolate variety  . In fairly recent year the plain chocolate one was produced and since then a variety of different types of digestive biscuits .These are quite large round biscuits one side covered in a  plain chocolate that is rippled onto it. The digestive biscuit is crunchy but crumbly.  It is made from wheat flour and oats. The biscuit tastes sweet and buttery, the chocolate is good nice flavour the plain chocolate is a good one, not too bitter. These biscuits are a good satisfying one. They are good comfort food ideal for a winters evening.There are 486 kcalories per100g or 84 kcal per biscuit , so do not eat a whole packet in one sitting or you will become rather round .These biscuits are to be found in a brown plasticy wrapper with the blue /white MC V logo. I have seen some lurking in cardboard tubers similar to Pringles tubes when opened the later stay crisp longer. The tubes contain 250g biscuits.McVities  dark plain home wheat chocolate biscuits are available in most supermarkets and corner shops in garage shops and I have seen them on sale in Spain. If you are living abroad they are available from an on line shop. I like Mc Vities dark plain chocolate home wheat digestive a lot they are one of the better chocolate digestives. Tesco sell them for     1.12 for a pack of 400g on offer at the moment 2 packs for    2.00  , I am going shopping tomorrow so shall stock up on some.       ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6755322:3:::6750576:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6780633:4:::6780633:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::6732793:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6603737:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6378505:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6778641:4:::6778641:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5567145:4:::6290957:4:::6474114:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6657747:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Flair Melissa & Doug - Stack and Sort Board::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::16.09.2009::::    Melissa and Doug make some good strong wooden toys. This  Flair Melissa   Doug - Stack and Sort Board is one I have seen many children use.  It is really an educational toy. This  board is a fairly thick base about 6cm wide and 2 cm thick it is about 30cm long .(my measurements are not exact but guesswork I do not have the toy with me but visualised it against a ruler I have here .) There are 5  poles of ascending heights fitted into the  natural coloured base these have  The tip at the enc coloured either red , blue , yellow , purple or green. Onto these fit coloured shapes. There is 1 green circle, two purple rectangles, 3 yellow triangles, 4 blue squares and  5 red pentagons 15 shapes in total . These shapes will fit onto any of the poles but the idea is to match the colours and shapes and then pop them onto the same pole. Each pole is just big enough for the correct number of coloured shapes.  So starting with one green circle the number of shapes on each pole increases by one. The shapes are easy to hold and put onto the poles each shape has a circular hole in the centre.This toy is suitable for a child aged 2 and over. I have used this toy with 5, 6, 7 ,8 year old special needs pupils. This toy promotes colour recognition and matching as well as counting skills. This toy also helps practise those fine motor manipulative skills. Children do enjoy playing with this toy. This Stack and Sort Board is good it is well made and strong should last many years many play hours. It is suitable for both,  home or school, nursery or playgroup. This toy cost    7.99 from http://www.amazon.co.uk. I would imagine it will be in one of the school equipment suppliers catalogue too. Would I recommend? Yes it is a good strong colour and counting stacker.     ::::6750576:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6145850:4:::3957:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::21963:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719974:4:::6758309:4:::5567145:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6378505:4:::6410840:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6657747:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6783831:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6785451:4:::6785451:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio Lifting Bridge 33357::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::15.09.2009::::    I was only playing with this toy train bridge yesterday at work, so I thought I would tell you about it.This Brio wooden lifting bridge is a good addition to a brio or brio compatible train set. My group of children and I built a train track across the classroom floor and added this bridge. The bridge includes to ascending tracks. When fitted into place the length including the 2 ascending tracks 648mm/25.5. quot; Brio tracks allow wooden trains to run along the two parallel grooves on the track. Brio track has grooves on both sides to make them reversible a piece of track that curves right can be turned over to make it curve in the opposite direction. One piece of track connects to the next with a male or female connector like a jigsaw piece has. This bridge is a lifting bridge. There are two short towers into which the ends of the bridge fit. The bridge itself is a long piece off Brio rail track with green plastic safety barrier sides to prevent any trains falling off it. There is a short piece of string attached to the centre of the bridge this is attached to a control tower at one end of the bridge. This has a little handle attached and the bridge can be raised and lowered by winding the handle. The height of the bridge is enough for a small toy car to go under without it being raised but for a toy lorry or a double Decker bus the bridge will need to be raised. Your child could   join the pieces of track together in such as way that the train track could go under this bridge. I think this bridge is a good addition makes the track more interesting. The group of children I had this afternoon had a great time playing with this as part of their train set. This bridge will help develop your childs imaginary play and help develop their fine motor control as they have to fir the male or female joining studs to other track and wind the handle to raise and lower the draw bridge .http://www.woodentoystore.co.uk    19.95  and at http://www.toysrus.co.uk/Toys-R-Us     24.99 ,  from http://www.amazon.com it costs  54.94 http://www.amazon.co.uk its    16.99,so as you can see it   s a good idea to search around for the best price . Brio is expensive but worth it . You can buy cheaper compatible sets the Tesco ones are I personally would buy the cheaper basic tracks  but stick to the Brio trains and additions. I think Brio wooden trains are fantastic they are well made from  Beech or Birch wood, this wood is free from toxic chemicals was grown not using insecticides . They are ve4y durable lasting many , many play hours .  Brio trains are ones that will last and be handed on to the next generation , my grand children   s set will go ion the loft after they have grown out of it for my great grandchildren to play with. Brio wooden toys were first made in  Sweden 1884 by basket maker Ivar Bengtsson and is now a global company. Would I recommend this lifting bridge by Brio ? Yes most definitely     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6391230:4:::6391230:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::6145850:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5567145:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6378505:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6780554:4:::6780554:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5719918:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6781514:4:::6781514:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6603737:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6474114:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6796382:4:::6796382:4:::5717149:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6788991:4:::6788991:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Fisher-Price Snail Pail::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.09.2009::::    It   s a long time since I played with this snail, one of the nursery classes that I used to visit had it.I do remember this was a bright cheerful easy shape sorter for children aged a year old, they would probably play with this until about 2 or 2     years oldThis shape sorter is made of a smooth plastic shaped like a snail  the body is blue. The head with cheeky grin and Google eyes is yellow. The head is easily removed and then slotted in again. There is a blue plastic tie to keep the head in position.There is a clear see through circular body which is the container for the shapes. A red curved lip flaps over the top of the body. The lid   has three shapes cut out of it to post the colourful shapes through.   The snails size is 9 quot;Hx10 quot;Lx3 1/2 quot;W.   There are 10 bright primary coloured shapes to post these come stored inside the snails    shell    These shapes are a flower shape, a star and a triangle. These shapes are thick and chunky and will stack together. With a bit of fiddling by your child these shapes do fit easily into the shaped holes provided. . The red lid flap can easily be lifted to put the shapes in too. A small child will happily play just emptying and filling the snail with shapes. This activity is good for early fine motor skill practice. Soon they will try to post the shapes through the holes learning how to fit shapes. Your child will sort the shapes and colours and stack the shapes too so lots of learning and practice here. There is an incentive of a single merry tune when the snail is rocked on its slightly curved base, there is a button that can be depressed towards the front of the snail ..

This bulldog plastic leaf rake is good for the job in a big garden with a large lawn. It would be ideal for someone who did not have a grass catcher on their lawn mower, or for raking a hay meadow garden. I do not have a large lawn or one of these rakes, but I do know someone who does. This rake comes with a 10 year guarantee. It is well made and I think that it would last longer than 10 years.It has a tubular handle which makes it lighter this has a soft comfortable grip.A  wide plastic head is attached to the handle this has 23 plastic tines This plastic rake from Bulldog costs 14.64 from http://www.diytools.co.ukOr 11.85 from  http://www.tools4trade.com .Plastic rakes are better for raking lawns clear of grass leaves  debris they cause less damage than a wire rake Raking the grass is quite good exercise and does help a lawn it removes all the dead grass and debris that can prevent the grass growing. It is recommended to rake in the autumn to remove the leaves then again in the spring after the snow to remove the thatch / dead grass and moss. The lawn grass roots will be healthier if they can breathe without much thatch.

Just in case you do not,  Duplo bricks are made by Lego. Duplo bricks are twice the length, height and width of traditional Lego brick. But they are compatible, will join onto Lego bricks. Lego have been making Duplo bricks since 1969 they have developed since .Duplo bricks are great construction bricks for children aged  between 2 and 5 years old a child older than 5 will play with them but be able to use harder construction sets.This brick set 5572 is a good one a great starter set, or one for nursery school. This set of bricks is contained in a sturdy green plastic box ideal for storage and keeping bricks tidy. There are 100 duplo pieces in this set, so plenty for your children   s constructions. Included in the set are the basic bricks of course there is also a duplo figure wearing a blue hat. There are a couple of bricks with wheels to make the chassis too that fantastic vehicle. Some of the bricks are clear so can be used for windows. There is a shaped one that will represent a roof.There are bricks with eyes to make those wondrous animals.. All your child needs are these bricks and some imagination to make the most fantastic buildings. You might need a bit of imagination to interpret them of course.  Don   t be too quick to say oh that   s a nice elephant it might not be it might be something completely different in your child   s eyes. Ask them about their construction to get clues as to what it is. Duplo bricks are great tools for early colour recognition the colours are bright. When playing ask your child for the different coloured bricks get them used to the names of colours , build blue/red towers. Talk to your child while playing with these bricks it will help their language development.  You can also help number work count the bricks build towers and  count the bricks , be careful though your child will undoubtedly knock the towers down , its added fun .

I saw the Winnie the Pooh 2 piece baby set, Now I do love Winnie the pooh. I usually will buy Bunnykins bowls for my friends and family babies, but I thought the pictures on this Winnie the Pooh 2 piece set enchanting.  In this attractively boxed set there was a bowl   one with the flat rim I think this shape called/ described as a baby plate and a two handled mug. Personally If I was buying I prefer the Albion shape bowl and a single handled mug think that they will get more use. Although some people receiving fine china for baby will not use it but keep it stored in its box. This set is made of lovely fine bone china so I can see why some parents would refrain from using it everyday . Shame as baby can be encouraged to eat his /her dinner and find out what Pooh bear is doing .  The bowl is white .Owl Eyeore and Pooh are delving into that honey pot and eating honey with their paws . Around the lip of the bowl is a yellow band with a few pictures of honey and apples on it . The two handled mug has a picture of pooh with his honey pot on the outside inside   are a few pots of honey printed on the white china. This set would be good for a baby to use but don   t give to a thrower or dropper. The  bowl a good size for cereal or weaning mush food. Although I prefer a single handled cup baby will find it easier to hold and control when they atre first learning how to use a cup.John Lewis is selling this set for    25 on line at http://www.johnlewis.com/ and in their retail sores . I love all this baby china from Royal Doulton. It is attractive which will encourage baby to eat.

When I was looking for a new fridge freezer I investigated the  Electrolux ERN28600 . This is a tall   white fridge freezer fully integrated so they can not be used separately. I was looking for a machine with a good rating this has a B energy rating.  Energy consumption in 1 year 321kwhThis is a built in model to fit in a fitted kitchen. This is a tall white giant 1772mm tall its width 540 depth 547. It has a large capacity. Sadly this fridge freezer too large for the space in my kitchen, after I had decided it was a good contender I had to reject it.Shame as this has the elements to be a good trustworthy fridge freezer.This has two doors which are reversible, will open on the left or right , I believe a lot of fridge freezers do this as well . The  fridge sits on top of the freezer .It has a large capacity Fridge Capacity (l/cu.ft): 173 freezer Capacity (l/cu.ft):110 . It is also CFC/HCF free There are 3 slim shelves for storage in the door for milk, juice or beer.The interior has 4 adjustable glass shelves in the fridge for those perishables such as cheese, margarine and other refrigerator foods. There is an egg tray for 6 eggs.The bottom of the fridge has a salad bin certainly plenty of space for a families food.FreezerThe freezer has 4 freezer draws these appear to be a good size. Overall this looks a good sized fridge freezer a bit too big for my kitchen. In the end I opted for separate fridge and freezer. This freezer is frost free so no defrosting.Noise I believe this is fairly noisy but I think frost free fridges are noisy in general Price At http://www.affiliatewindow.be-direct.co.uk is    498.99 at  you can find it several other places from this price upwards to about    560.         ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6177657:3:::6177657:3:::6796495:3:::6796495:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::21963:3:::5953084:3:::5953084:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6772013:3:::6772013:3:::6701923:3:::6788991:3:::6788991:3:::6410840:3:::5719918:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6773030:3:::6773030:3:::6397261:3:::6750576:3:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6145850:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6338302:4:::6338302:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6312383:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo 6178 My Lego Duplo Town::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::05.09.2009::::    There are 79 pieces in this my Town building set from Lego Duplo RRP    17.59 http://www.dominoestoys.co.uk/dynamic/viewitem.php?item=6178 20LE001 are selling it for    17.51p This would make a great starter set for a child aged 2 and older a normal 5 year old will be beginning to grow out of Duplo Lego but these bricks will join to the smaller Lego as they are twice the size.This My town set is great it includes yellow , red , blue , green and brown bricks  there are  4 wheels to make a car , there are  windows to make a house or office block/ block of flats  a few of the bricks are sloping ,to make a roof maybe or the tree shape. There is a flower brick and a few white fences. A base comes with the set to give a building stability. Also 1 figure comes with this set will make a tree a bricks. The buildings that your child will make is only as limited as their experience and imagination. A child will have a great time with these Duplo bricks inventing their own imaginary world and while doing so make sense of the real world. I really think Lego Duplo bricks are fantastic children love them, (I can tell that by the length of time that they will play with Duplo bricks) Duplo bricks are attractive bright primary colours ideal for teaching your child his/her colours. Duplo bricks are safe they are smooth and most a bit big to put in the mouth and swallow, do watch those flowers though.  Duplo bricks are easy for a child   s hand to grasp a good size too.While your child is playing don   t tell them but they are also learning playing is really a child   s work, practicing their fine and gross motor skills. Learning the properties of materials Duplo Lego plastic smooth and has nobly bits. Learning to count, oh go on count with your child as they are building a tower. Learning language too, up down on top under , by the side , beneath do talk to your child while playing with them. If your child is playing with another or in a group while playing with Lego they are also learning social skills a 2 year old will happily play alongside another a three year old will join in and they will play together cooperating well maybe but it   s a time to learn sharing  the disappointment of not getting the wheels first.Yes Lego Duplo are great bricks I would recommend this My Town set for your child at home or for the child care centre . They are very, very durable will last many play hours Mt grandchildren have some  not the town set but another Duplo set 30 + years old they were my daughters . All they need is a wash in warm soapy water when they get dirty. I disinfected ours too after they had been in the loft for 20 years.  Lego have been making Duplo bricks since 1969 by  Lego a Danish firm.

There are other pictures on the plates  in this selection too.These paper plates do save a lot of work too no washing up just throw them in the bin .However the plates are made from paper they are sturdy though the picture is printed on a sort of plasticky surface unless you have wet food you  might be able to rescue these plates wipe clean with a damp cloth  and your child can use for a sandwich again.

I was lured into the gift shop at the natural history museum in Tring by my grandchildren. I did not want to spend much money so the children were directed to the cheap toys and my granddaughter aged 3 choose a jointed snake.* cost. Availability.This jointed snake coast me 50p I think . It is available from other novelty shops and on line at  http://www.tobar.co.uk  Probably at Hawkins sport too.*Well for 50p you don   t expect much do you and we didn   t get much either. What we did get was an orange red jointed hard plastic snake. There were black eyes and on each of 6 of the body segments there is a black, yellow and white circles looks a bit like a target .As well as these 6 jointed segments there is the head and a tail segment too. These segments are all joined together by a couple of pegs this makes them jointed and the segments will move about if touched.  These snakes can be bought in different colours green, white, yellow. A *FUN * way to make these move is to  hold them by the tail in a pincher grip and move your hand a little the snake will then sway about in a *realistic* fashion . My 3 year old granddaughter fiddled with this snake after we bought it and made it wriggle around she was mildly interested. My 6 year old grandson got it held it up wriggled the body about and dangled it over me when I was sat in a chair * I think I was supposed to be frightened, so I gave a *scared* squeal or two you know the sort Nanas do. Grandson was a little amused then chased his little sister around the room with it . . This was then the demise of the jointed snake it got grabbed and a bit squashed the joints became unjointed. The snake not really played with since.*So  it was ok for a few moments a throw away toy, would I recommend well not really it might work as a party favour  for that party bag after an Indiana Jones party      ::::5813182:3:::5813182:3:::6750576:3:::5552133:3:::5552133:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6792895:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::6603737:4:::21963:4:::6795177:4:::6781956:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6378505:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6718048:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5816422:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

They are 25p each from http://www.shop.shoppingwithdinosaurs.co.uk   also available at http://store.dinosaurcorporation.com for  0.39 on sale usual price  0.79 . There are 4 different colours and designs available a blue one a purple one a red one and a brown one.  These dinosaur gliders are suitable for children over 3.+Contents Each long paper envelope pack contained information about the dinosaur and instructions for constructing the glider. This packet contained 3 flat pieces of shaped thin polystyrene which coloured brown this had markings on it to make it look like features and the skin of a dinosaur. There was also this small piece of clear plastic which had a slot in it this fitted on to be the nose. Each pack contains pieces for 1 dinosaur .There are 4 different coloured dinosaurs available a blue one a purple one a red one and a brown one+Construction Each piece of polystyrene/Styrofoam had slots cut into it. My 6 year old grandson soon worked out where to slot the wings of the dinosaur onto the body then to slot the tail  into position, The plastic nose was positioned.. This was simple easy to do a 5 -6 year old should be able to do it unaided.+Finished product. Looked good suitable    terrifying         It has a wingspan of about 21cm. this polystyrene flyer looked quite realistic+Flying  We went outside to launch the dinosaur it flew well and the length of the lawn it was a good flier. We could have flown it inside but I thought it might get broken when it flew into furniture. This dinosaur so light it could do little damage to any furnishings.  +LongevityAs long as this dinosaur does not fly into too many walls or trees I lasts well I saw it a little battered in my grandsons bedroom a month after we had bought it .+ConclusionThese are great cheap little fliers. Ideal for a pocket money toy, ideal for a dinosaur party  a fling competition in the garden with these would be fun , or put them in the party bag to take home . They also would be a fun Christmas stocking filler. Do I recommend ? YES     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5285637:4:::6791962:4:::6791962:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6792895:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::21963:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5631861:4:::5631861:4:::6378505:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6778369:4:::6778369:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6474927:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Spear & Jackson Traditional Border Spade::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::31.08.2009::::      Soon it will be time to get digging the vegetable patch over and tidying up the flower borders ready for winter. For this job you need a good spade. I do have and use a standard digging spade, but I like to use this Spear and Jackson border spade will do the job well it is a mate to the border fork that I have.Size~This spade is a good size at 14 centimetres it is  narrower than a digging spade this is good for the borders allows you to get in narrower spaces around shrubs. The length of the shaft is 94 cm. This is a good  height for me to use I am 5 ft 6in  I think a taller person would also find it comfortable to dig with my 5ft 11 son in law has no problem with it.Blade/head ~~The 14cmwide blade is made from mirror polished stainless steel. This is rust resistant and a minimum of soil sticks to it . Remember when hanging up your spade for winter clean the blade , scrape soil from it  my dad always used to oil the blade to help keep it rust free .  However this spade is made from a good stainless steel that is rust resistant and should last many, many years Two stainless steel rivets are used this gives a lot of strength to the head where if fits to the wooden shaft . Shaft~~The stainless steel head of this spade    extends as the lower part of the shaft into which a one piece hardwood shaft is fitted.  The shaft is thick and strong This shaft is weatherproof for greater durability and to prevent splintering of the wood. However for really long life do not leave stuck in the garden put it away in the shed . My dad always used to treat the wooden shafts with linseed oil before putting away for winter Handle~~ The shaft is split at the end and makes a wishbone shaped handle . The handle  is an integral part of the shaft not made from a separate piece of wood.  This is stronger than an added on handle .The handle is good to hold   . Guarantee~~. This spade has a ten year guarantee  however I would think this spade will last many more years than, that a lifetime of gardening for me .

I rummaged in my drawer and low and behold I found not one not 2 but 3 of these pencils. I hold one in my hand right now. Steadtler also make coloured pencils in the Noris style. Looks Staedtler have made these pencils for several; years now and many of you will recognise the yellow and black coloured lacquered striped coat of this pencil. Yellow and black stripes go up and down the pencil at the top there is first a white circle around the circumference then a red or black cap end to finish off, This pencil looks quite slim and elegant.. This pencil is not a round one there are 5 degrees, flattened straight sides.There is some gold writing on 2 of the black lacquered sides is says Staedtler and gives a little info. The softness type is at the end of the pencil, sensible as this should be the last bit to be sharpened. This pencil is made of wood which encloses a graphite lead.Lead The graphite pencil has super-bonded lead which is designed to be break resistant. This Steadler Noris pencil comes in various hardness 2B , B, HB, H , 2H  . There are different coloured cap ends  for the lead type the red cap is HB the  black cap2B.l  The pencil can be sharpened using any standard pencil sharpener. Opts I made a mistake, never mind its easy to erase the pencil mark, rub out with this pencil eraser I have.  Size. I measured the longest of my pencils  it measures 16 cm, it has not been sharpened much so this is an  only a little short  of a new pencil The width is just under 1cm.. Use  This pencil is easy to grip I think the flattened edges help. The 5 flattened sides certainly help with that roll away pencil problem, these pencils do not roll.These staedtler noris pencil are a good pencil they give a good Mark on paper. You will find many schools and offices use these pencils. HistoryStaedtler is a german company Johann SebastianStaedtler founded a pencil manufacturing plant in 1835,  he was following a family tradition as Friedrich Staedtler,was active in the pencil-making trade with records  dating as far back as 1662.Pencils made by Staedtler can be bought in many countries , There are factories makingStaedtler pencils in other countries as well as Germany, Looking at my pencil I see it has Great Britain stamped on it in gold.Where to buy , priceYou can buy These pencils in most stationers  on or off line . http://www.ryman.co.uk sell them at 99p each there is a cheaper offer for bulk buying.

       " '5247778::::Ben 10 Back Pack::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.08.2009::::    Ready for school? ~~~ Don   t forget your backpack full of those essential things. There are so many backpacks around these days with pictures of favourite characters. I had to use a boring school satchel carried over 1 shoulder. So if your child is Hannah Montana mad or Ben 10 crazy you will find the back pack to suit them. I know a child who is Ben 10 mad so his parents bought him a back pack featuring Ben. This back pack is available from several sources. ToysRus have it for    9.99 Amazon have it from    12.99. Looks~ This is a black and green backpack. The main compartment is black with a green trim this closes with a long zip.  This has the word Ben 10 written centre front .On the front of the bag there is a small zipped pocket this has Ben ten in an action shot .on it and is the green colour. On the sides of the bag there are 2 net pockets ideal for a drink bottle .Straps ~ There are straps at the back to put your child   s arms through to enable them to carry this bag on their back, these are adjustable .There is also a small loop to hang the bag on  the peg in the cloakroomSuitability.~This back pack is suitable for a 6 year old to carry. Ideal for school to carry a pencil case,  a book an apple or a packet of crisps for snack. This backpack would also be great for carrying PE or swimming kit in .But do not over load it  and make it too heavy for your child to carry, no they do not need to take all their toy to school (school will not want their toys there anyway). This back pack is also ideal for carrying toys and essentials when your child is going on a visit too.Size~This back pack is much the same size as other children   s backpacks it measures  32 x 39 cm; it weighs 332 g Durability~ This backpack seems well made quite durable. It is made from a fairly waterproof fabric.General~ I think this is quite a good back pack and will be loved by a child who is a ben 10 fan . Backpacks are a good way of carrying fairly heavy loads . Do encourage your child to carry his/her bag correctly on their back arms through the straps. This distributes the weight over the back making it easier to carry. . It is much easier and better for the body to carry a back pac/rucsac than a shoulder bag. Wont be many days now before I meet the children coming into school with their bags I wonder if the child that I am thinking of will have a new bag I think not this  Ben 10 bag was still in good condition after nearly a year of use . There are other similar backpacks with Ben ten featured on them but this one pictured her is the one I describe. There are some slightly different styles and sizes featuring different Ben 10 scenes.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5633146:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6145850:4:::5719918:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6789981:4:::6789981:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6689593:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5690767:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6378505:4:::6474114:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6754091:4:::6754091:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This mug as you can guess from the title is a striped one the stripes go around the circumference of the mug not up and down. The stripes are fairly thin orange, blue, yellow, white, the handle orange and white. The inner glaze of the mug is orange. This mug is one of a mix and match range from Wittards of Chelsea.  There is a different style of mug in the same design and also a matching tea pot, matching coasters , matching plates , matching cups   of differing styles all with the stripe design , Also if you wish to mix your  designs Wittards do a spotty set or a Geometric  design the same shape and colours  these would not look wrong if presented as a mixed  set together .However this striped jumbo mug is a good one just on its own or part of a set. It is an attractive mug it feels good to hold and to drink from, suitable for any drink hot or cold.Washing up well this mug can be washed by hand or in the dishwasher. It is also microwave safe so when you let your tea get cold you can reheat it *Durable? Well its stronger than bone china but obviously will break if you drop it on a hard floor *Price  This mug will cost    6 at http://www.whittard.co.uk I am sure I have seen this mug for sale in the high street at china shops or large department stores. Would I recommend?  Yes it was a good mug to drink from and look at.

These care really good substantial rakes. Unless you have a huge garden I doubt you wopuld need one these are more suitable for fields and paddocks.  We use these on conservation clearance tasks to rake up grass after it has been cut in the autumn. These wooden hay rakes are in fact quite beautiful in a way. They are a traditional style.  Looks like a rake my great grandfathers would have used  gathering the hay.   .This rake has a very wide head and a long reach. This Faithful rake has a 6 foot shaft.

I bought it at the local garden centre 3 for    10 This plant is a Perennial. I like perennials as they last a long time and will flower for several years.  Pratia puberula    Alba    is a member of the Campanulaceae family,  the bellflowers. Included in this family are many white and blue bell shaped flowers , the harebell and Canterbury bells amongst them .This Australian native is very low growing and is good for ground cover. The evergreen leaves tiny and rounded on creeping branching stems.  This grows as a flat carpet on the ground. In the spring I am told I can divide the plant and make two or even 3 plants from one.Pratia puberula Alba has tiny white star like 5 petalled flowers. Alternatively there is a Pratia that has delicate blue flowers. This plant should flower most of the summer. I have planted one on my rockery another in the flower bed. These plants like a partially shaded yet sunny spot. They do like a moist yet well drained spot I hope my chalk soil is ok as it is a bit dry.  These plants are doing well look pretty with their little flowers sparkling in the green leavers I do like ground cover plants. I shall see how they over winter and maybe buy more next year.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6731397:3:::6731397:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6776705:4:::5717149:4:::6378505:4:::6290957:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This is one I bought a few years ago It has been replaced but still in working order its in the cupboard just in case I need it. I can not remember how old it is but it has  a fair bit of use so must be quite durable. I changed it because the white plastic outer was looking grimy and there was a good offer on a new one that matched my toaster. This kettle is a corded kettle the electric lead plugs into a socket on the lower back of the kettle.  There is an on off switch a little lever positioned by the socket in the kettle. This kettle automatically switches off when boiling.. Should the kettle be boiled when it is dry there is a fail safe the kettle will switch off automatically. This is a 2200w kettle boils reasonably fast.The shape of this kettle is a tall fairly straight sided one not a traditional curvy shape, few kettles are these days. There is a fairly large handle melded into the back of the kettle, the hole big enough for a manly hand . This handle is quite comfortable to grip.On the side of the kettle there is a long thin oval clear window so you can see the water level. This kettle will hold 1.5 litres of water, enough for 6 cups of tea. Top front of the kettle there is a little pert spout. This pours fine, no dribbling. The lid is covers nearly all the top of the kettle it is opened by squeezing the indented release griping the centre with your finger and thumb. The lid opens and is a good sized opening to pour water in via tap or water filter jug.There is a removable scale filter in the kettle this is fairly easy to remove and cleanfilter.

Spear and Jackson have been making stainless steel tools for a long time. In 1760 the foundations for the firm were built when John Love and Alexander Spear went into the steel business together. It was in 1830 that Sam Jackson joined the firm and this partnership became the Spear and Jackson   s In 1985 Neill Tools bought Spear   Jackson in 1985, renaming the business Spear   Jackson plc in 1995.  *Handle   Now this Spear and Jackson digging fork that I now have has a wooden wishbone handle at the top. This is easy to grip and enables me to put some force into the spade. *Shaft. The shaft of the fork is wood too there is no join between shaft and handle as the wood that is used for the shaft has been split and divided to form the  wishbone handle.The hard wood used to make the shaft has been hardened to  make it last longer. Handle Size - 710mm (28 quot;)*Head. The size of this head its head 280mm x 180mm (11 quot; x 7 quot;) . It has 4 prongs /tines. The metal goes upwards into a shaft for quite a distance along  the wooded  shaft. This makes it a strong tool.

One I have seen baby use is the baby plate, it was a china plate but a melamine one is also produced.*Shape. Now this Bunnykins baby plate is a better shape for baby really than the flat plate or even the cereal/pudding type bowl. It has a flat stable base and straight sides /edges. There is a lip at the top of the straight sides this makes the bowl easier for mummy/daddy/nanny to grip while feeding baby. Personally I prefer the standard flat plate, or the other shape of bowl, Albion I believe its called, the pudding shaped bowl. This baby plate does look babyish I think the other shapes would be more acceptable to a 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 year old who thinks they are grown up . *Pictures  There are several different scenes that are found on bunnykins baby plates . Royal Doulton rotates the use of the transfers.A Nun, Sister Mary Barbara drew the designs for her father the manager of Royal Doulton s pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. Bunnykins pictures on nursery ware have been delighting children for 75 years now.Along the top rim of this baby plate run a row of bunnies with a few tufts s of green grass the straight sides are plain white no design but at the bottom of the plate there is one of the designs this could be the kite one or , maybe the bunnykins fishing or the one where they are rafting . The bunnies are al doing human activities and are dressed in clothes. The pictures are good encourage baby to eat his/her dinner and lots to talk about and look for in the pictures*SizeThis bunnykins baby plate is 16 cm diameter a good size for baby   s cereal or dinner. * Purchase   You can buy Bunnykins baby plate at several places sometimes it is part of a set At http://www.chinaetc.co.uk one cost    15 at  http://www.kingsandqueens.org.uk its    10*Durability. Well the one I am describing and thinking about is made of bone china , so bone china and babies well do babies throw things from their high chair onto the floor  ? Yes of course they do. Does bone china break on contact with said floor? Yes it does. So it is best for use only with adult feeding baby. The durability of this design of plate is long lasting I think even though Royal Doulton went into receivership this January. This delightful series of pictures will be around on the base of a baby plate which is also a good design for many, many more years.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5624457:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6474927:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6338302:4:::6338302:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The shaft is shaped, well balanced this makes it easy and comfortable to hold. This hard wood handle has been varnished. The handle a good size to hold The head/ tines/ prongs of the fork forged from a single piece of steel , this makes it strong , no weak points. There are three prongs to this hand fork. The fork head is then coated in carbon steel epoxy. This fork should not rust. The prongs are strong they do not bend when used against something hard. I have found a different cheaper make bend when pressure put on it . The fork head is attached to the handle with a brass ferrule.(new word I have learnt due to writing these garden equipment reviews ferrule is a metal ring this is used to keep the join of the handle fork tines together and neat) There is a 10 year guarantee with this tool. This hand garden fork is a good one it feels comfortable to hold a good size for all those little jobs that require a hand fork. So what do I use it for? Well to be honest I rarely use a hand fork I sometimes use it when weeding. It is useful for forking around small plants and seedlings I sometimes use this when I am transplanting seeds. This fork causes less disturbance than a trowel. Whwen the grandchildren visit and I am gardening I often give them this tool to use, I feel its safe and they can do little dammage with it . I occasionally clean the prongs by wiping them clean with a rag I keep in the greenhouse for cleaning my tools.      ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6739162:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6378505:4:::5816422:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Open the packet and break a piece of this tablet off, the scoring of the fudge makes it easy to break into small squares. Pop a square of tablet into your mouth. The texture is granular I guess that   s the sugar. The fudge is not hard fudge but soft fudge crisp yet moist that you can easily get your teeth into. When you bite the fudge crumbles into your mouth.Taste ~~~~~ It taste sweet and buttery, a light vanilla flavour . It tastes good really fudge. I savor a mouthful and I can discern the sweet sugar, the buttery vanilla twang and there is this hint of a sweet milky flavour I masticate the fudge and the flavour  is that of condensed milk sweet creamy milk.I like this fudge fortunately I bought more than I needed so some left over for me to eat.This vanilla fudge is quite sweet and 3 small pieces from my tablet is enough.Oopps i have eaten it all. i am not going up to Scotland where this scottish tablet can be bought in tourist shops, sweetshops , confectioners and supermarkets .I am not aware of anywhere down South selling Gordon and DURWOODS Scottish tablet , so I shall have to make my own fudge (tablet) Fudge is basically sugar , condensed milk, butter ,  flavourings if required There are several recipie sites for this on the internet  A really good recipe and description of how to make is at http://scruss.com/tablet.html other sites with recipies are http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/blrecipe_tablet.htm and htmlhttp://scruss.com/tablet.html several more sites with recipe also I expect you will find it in a cookery book  too .     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5255134:4:::21963:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5816422:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6163519:4:::6163519:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6657747:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6338302:4:::6338302:4:::6474114:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6757811:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This marmalade comes in a 454 g glass jar. The label proudly announcing it is a traditional Seville orange marmalade. It is sealed with a twist lid. The marmalade shines orange through the jar and the thick cut peel can be seen. Now that might be a put off to some people as they dislike thick bits in their marmalade. Duerr   s make many other varieties of marmalade too so you should find one to suit. Opening the jar and there is a delicious smell of oranges. Putting my knife in to get some to put on my toast I find that the marmalade is quite thick and a few of the thick shreds are on my knife. I put some on my toast and spread. It spreads fairly well obviously there are the thick cut shreds too. Tasting my first bite it is a fairly sweet pleasant well flavoured marmalade the thick cut shreds a little chewy, yum yum I like this marmalade. Hubby complains he does not like bits in his marmalade these are too thick for him.  There are 261kcal in 100g of this marmalade; you only need a little on a piece of toast though.  This marmalade sells for    1.04 at Sainsbury   s or you can buy two on offer for    1.50 at Ocado This marmalade is quite a good one Maybe not my all time favourite but well into the top choice ones.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6757811:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::5328942:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6474927:4:::5717149:4:::6378505:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6750576:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::ALEX Toys On the Go Bathtime Squirters::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.08.2009::::    Squirt one of these vehicles at your child and I guarantee they will squeal with joy. Yes more water squirters from Alex toys this time ones shaped like vehicles. There are 5 vehicles  a boat, a car, a plane a police car , and a fire engine .They come in a  clear zip  bag which has a mesh net base so when they are all tidied away you can hang them up to drain. These PVC water squirters are phthalate free so they are safe for baby. They are suitable for babies over 6 months old  .A baby this age will probably not have as much fun with them as an 18 month to 3 year old will.These water squirters are fairly easy to grasp and squeeze to make them squirt water after they have been immersed in the bath or pool.. .  Each water squirter is about 7cm long a good size for a little hand. These vehicles are quite attractive appropriately   coloured and the lights of the vehicle look ike eyes the radiator grill a nose the bumper looks like a mouth. The colour of the ones at school has faded a little with the chlorine and use.   Now the fun bit there is a hole for the water to squirt out of at the centre front of each vehicle just above the bumper between the headlights. Just squeeze the body of the vehicle and water will squirt out a fair distance. These produce a reasonable squirt if water but not too strong a jet so an older child would probably want a stronger squirter for water play. These vehicles are fun in the bath paddling pool and in my works (special needs school) swimming pool. Water play is not only fun but educational too. Your child will experience floating, sinking, cause and reaction, the movement and force of water. Will also interact with others when squirting or being squirted, learning not to squirt someone when they say no.    They also help with that muscle strength in the hand, your child will have the incentive to squeeze and build up muscle tone Would I recommend these? Yes. Alex make a variety of sets or water squirters, farm animals, jungle animals, dinosaurs, ocean, vehicles, garden,  space . so you can buy water squirters to suit your child   s interests.  These cheerful transport water squirters cost RRP    7.99 http://www.amazon.co.uk/ PRICE    6.94, or USD  11.99 Just remember to drain these squirters of water before storing or they will eventually go a bit manky with stale water .Othjerwise apart from chewing these water squirters should last a couple of years .     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6788991:4:::6788991:4:::5633146:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6145850:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6776705:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5703013:4:::5703013:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6758379:4:::6758379:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5839312:4:::5839312:4:::6739162:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6290957:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I personally am no over keen on Dahlias but my mum was and I would often receive them as a gift from her. Dahlias originate from Mexico. They are from the family Compositeae the daisy family.If you grow dahlias in your garden beds then it   s really time to plant them now, late May early June after the frosts. Dahlias grow well in patio pots too The dahlia likes a rich soil which retains water no good on my chalk garden soil really.There are various species and a variety of colour s, reds oranges yellows They will flower July to October. You should be able to buy Dahlias ready for planting from garden centre. You can grow them from seed, cuttings   or root division. Dahlias grow from a tuber (thickened underground stem) I can just remember dad digging them up and saving them in a frost free shed over winter . Dahlias do not like frost. You can get small species growing 30cm tall, or tall species growing 30 cm tall . The flowers range from tiny ones to those 30 cm in diameter.Dahlia flowers can either be single or double depending on the species. The petals are waxy and slightly pointed. They are a bright colour.  Dahlias  are good as a cut flower last ages indoors mum often used to have a vase full.       ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6410840:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5633146:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6781514:4:::6781514:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6733652:4:::6733652:4:::5816422:4:::6378505:4:::6474927:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6310942:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Smoby toys tend to be inexpensive and last fairly well. My work has several Smoby toys.Sorry I do not know the price of this sand set but I would imagine it would be around    5.00.Let me describe this Smoby sand set. There is a green bucket the handle to this is well attached. Then there is a round purple sieve this fits onto the rim of the bucket easy to sieve these will hold the spade and the rake.The spade has a plastic handle and blade good for scooping and digging in the sand pit..Then the rake yellow plastic with 5 prongs/tynes on it. With this set there is also a blue watering can and a pink sand mold in the shape of a teddy bear. This set includes enough toys to let your child experiment with sand on the beach or a sand tray.This toy is a good toy the pieces are a good strong plastic it should last for a long time.Sand and water play is such a good educational experience and the addition of tools like this will enhance and offer more areas for learning and playing. If you have a young child a sand pit in the garden is excellent your child will spend many happy hours playing with it.With this Smoby sand set your child will learn the properties of sand learning that dry sand will fall through the sieve, that if you pour water using the blue watering can in this instance sand will change and stick together and he/ she can make sand castles or a teddy bear shape using the mould. Using the rake your child can make patterns in both wet and dry sand, making marks like this at 12 months old is the beginning of learning how to write. Playing with sand your child is learning science. With this sand set and more than one child playing they will learn social skills turn taking, how to handle the disappointment of not having the bucket Best of all for mum when a child is playing in the sand is that they can be occupied for hours and mum can sit and sunbathe in the garden too.  Sand and water are really the best early playthings and this bucket set is a really good one I would certainly recommend      ::::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6145850:4:::5633146:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6739162:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6617328:4:::6617328:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6781514:4:::6781514:4:::5646482:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6290957:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5816422:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6474927:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6410840:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::ALEX Toys Farm Stickers::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::30.07.2009::::    Time for fun in the bath  Let   s find all the toys then. I have some farm bath time stickers. (well they are works ones really).  These Farm bath time stickers are toys from Alex who produce many children   s toys. This set of stickers is in a mesh bag, approx 24 cm (H) x 21cm (W) This bag has suction cups that attach to loops at the top of the net bag . The suction cups make it easy to fix the bag to the bathroom tiles the mesh bag ideal to pop the stickers in after use so that they will drain and dry. You could just hang the bag up by a fabric loop that is on the top of the bag too. These stickers are foam stickers chubby shaped about half a cm thick. The dense foam has been cut to an animal shape. One surface is the plain yellow foam the other a durable coloured plasticy type with the animal features coloured on.I will be honest with you I can not remember how many animals in the bag or their size as they are at school and I am on holiday.  However there are quite a lot of animals. From memory I can recall a pig , a cow, a chicken , a cat , a sheep, a horse , a tractor, some grass hillocks,  and a couple more  I seem to remember a duck These are a good size for little hands, not too small yet small enough to pick up and hold I guess   they are mostly around 6 cm , not all the same size. These animals colours are not real animal colours ok the pig is pink but the cow pink too   a purple sheep mmm . They all have the eyes and a mild expression on their faces. So do they stick? Yes when wet these will stick reasonably well to a smooth surface not permanently of course. These animals are fun to have floating around in the bath or water tray. We use them for animal topics.   Your child can just hold them feel them look at them or give your child a net and they can catch them. You can use them out of the water too to as a prop  for  a story or  just to use as amimal shapes . These toys are suitable for a 2 year old. .They shapes are quite durable, they will take a bit of squashing and bending , but watch out they might get bitten  and tooth marks left in them . Right time to put the toys away  put them back in the bag  they will dry fairly quickly. Where can you buy some did you ask? Well on line at http://www.babyjacks.co.uk they are    6.49p. and    7.99p from http://www.bonkers-standrews.co.uk or  buy direct from http://www.alextoys.com USD  8.99.

       " '5247778::::Tesco French Glace Cherries::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::28.07.2009::::    Tesco French glace cherries. I will soon be buying some glace cherries. I expect I will but tescos as I usually shop there.So what are glace cherries? You mean you mum never gave you one to eat when she was baking a cake. Glace cherries are those red sticky sweet cherries used in baking. Glace cherries are made by heating cherries in a sugar syrup the cherries lose their colour so they are usually coloured with a red colouring. Americans call these fruits candied cherries. The cherry loses a lot of its moisture in this process and gets a leathery texture it   s very sweet and has a sugary sweet sticky skin. Cals per100g 1300kJ (310kcal)I have had Tesco glace cherries before and found them good. You can buy Tesco French glace cherries in 100 and 200 gram clear plastic pots with cherry red labels . You can also buy natural colour glace cherries. This implies that the French glace cherries are not a natural colour; yes looking on the web site I see that the colour is Erythrosine. I guess that   s why glace cherries are that bright red. The price of Tesco glace cherries is 65p for 100g, Glace cherries have quite a long date on them when you buy them they store well. These cherries are ideal for making my Christmas cake , my Christmas pudding, I shall also use glace cherries to decorate my trifle. I might make some cherry cakes, or add some to my flapjacks. Glace cherries can be used in many baking recipies.When you use glace /candied cherries for baking wash and dry them first to get the sticky sugar from their surface , then put them in a little flour before adding to you cake mix . This will help stop them sinking to the bottom of your cake.A recipe I use for making cherry cakes is 225 g margarine/butter225g sugar225g SR flour4 eggs250g cherries. I usually put these into little cake cases cook at 180 c for about 15 minutes When cool you can ice and put     a glace cherry on top.

       " '5247778::::Peta Uk Easi-Grip Scissors::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::27.07.2009::::    SQUEEZE SCISSOREWhile strictly not a toy I put these here because I use them at school and I could not think what other category to put them in.Learning how to use scissors for any child is difficult. You need good arm and wrist control also good finer motor skills, an ability to grasp and release the scissors to coordinate hand and eye. Learning to cut with scissors is not easy it   s even harder if you have some kind of special needs an inability to grasp or use your fingers. Several of my students have problems which make them unable to use standard scissors and people with arthritis or thumb injuries have problems using scissors too.At work we have several pairs of easy to use scissors, hand squeeze ones like the ones in the picture.  Basically hand squeeze scissors are scissor blades with a soft loop handleHow to use squeeze scissors. First sit on a chair in a good position and have the item to cut on a table in front of you. Place the loop handle in the palm of one hand blades pointing outwards by thumb and first finger. Make hand into a fist put the item to be cut in position and then squeeze the scissors making sure blades meet. This will cut the paper /fabric. Release the squeeze and that was 1 cut. To cut along a line on paper hold squeeze and lightly release the pressure and move along the item to be cut.These scissors certainly are easier for our students to use and I would recommend having some at home if your child has problems using standard scissors. They are also ideal for anyone with problems using scissors, great gran /dad would probable like a pair. I think we get our work ones through a schools supplier, but I just looked on line and you can buy hand squeeze scissors for children and some other child training scissors at http://www.ukshopability.co.uk/peta/acatalog/Peta_UK_Ltd_In_the_Classroom_9.html. Hand squeeze scissors cost    2.60 for small ones and    5. 65 for larger ones.  I think the larger hand squeeze scissors would be fine for an adult to use too http://www.kinderkeyinternational.co.uk/ProductsSee-cat44-id185.html has some hand squeeze scissors available too price is    8.60.Some of these scissors are available either with round or pointed ends. Children (and adults too) benefit from learning some skills before using scissors. Give your child the opportunity to use wind up toys and finger puppets. Play finger games like incy wincy spider, use tweezers to pick up items. Use clothes pegs squeezing them and pegging them onto clothes tins or boxes. Use play dough to roll or make modells. Thread some beads to make a necklace, all these activities use skills that are used in cutting with scissors.I certainly would recommend these types of scissors for anyone with problems cutting with scissors.

       " '5247778::::Staedtler Noris Club Triangular Double-Hole Tub Sharpener::::Office Equipment::::40::::very helpful::::26.07.2009::::    A Pencil sharpener, Sorry I could not think of a more exotic exciting product to write about really.Staedtler is an old German company over 150 years old. They make good products including this pencil sharpener Just recently I needed to sharpen quite a lot of pencils and coloured pencils so I used a Staedtler Noris Club Double Hole Sharpener t,his inspired me to write this review   This double holed pencil sharpener is a blue tub pencil sharpener.  That has 2 different sized sharpeners embedded in its lid.The lid with the 2 metal pencil sharpeners inserted has a safety lock this avoids accidental opening and spilling the contents everywhere. There is a small clear plastic cover across the top of the holes on the top of the sharpener this cover is hinged it prevents shavings from spilling. So this is a much less messy pencil sharpener to use. . Two ends of the lid are curved but the others is straight this is easier to grip when using the sharpener. This double holes sharpener is useful if you have different sized pencils This sharpener will sharpen standard size pencils 8.2mm and thicker pencils up to10.2mm. The blades of the sharpener sharpen the pencil at a 30degree angle. So choose the right sized hole for your pencil insert the pencil and sharpen away. The sharpening   s fall into the see through plastic tub fixed to the sharpening lid. The plastic tub also has 2 curved ends and 2c straight ones for easier grip.The tub is big enough that you can sharpen several pencils before you need to empty it.  To open the lid grip and press the side of the tub I think it actually says press on it this makes it easier to pull the top off. This is a much cleaner way to sharpen pencils my fingers do not get lead colours on them and it is so much easier to just empty the pot than to keep sharpening on a piece of paper or over the bin  .This is quite a durable sharpener should last several years. Would I recommend? Yes. So how much does this pencil sharpener cost ? Well its    3.00 from Amazon.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6701923:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6145850:4:::5719974:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5285637:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::8689:4:::5335750:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6157866:4:::6157866:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5328942:4:::6750576:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5347743:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

If your child has a basic duplo train set, or you want to create one for them then you might want to buy the set of straight rails to expand it. This pack2734 contains 6 pieces. It costs    4.99p from the Lego shop http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=2734 LangId=20 57 ShipTo=UK. It is also available at other toy shops and toy departments for around the same price. Basically this set is just the straight train track pieces you will need to buy curved pieces too if you wish to make a circuit and you will need to buy a train to run on it too. The curved track 2735 is a good compatible set to make a circuit it is available together withy the straight track for    9.96p at Amazon Lego duplo trains are suitable for a child aged between 2 and 5 although slightly younger and slightly older children will also play with them happily. Duplo is made of a strong plastic it is a safe toy. A two year old should find that after watching mummy or daddy put some together and initially been given some help that with some practice they will be able to put the train track together on their own, The pieces of train track are a grey plastic each piece will fit into another duplo train track piece. Your child may think they are playing, but we know better they are working, learning. While playing with duplo train tracks your child is developing their spatial awareness, developing their gross and fine motor skills, practicing their manipulative skills leraning how to place and fit things together, When your child is playing it is also a time you can use to develop their language skills learning from you the correct words for fitting pieces together... Lego duplo train tracks and trains can be played with by children on their own or in a group. a child learns to play with others cooperatively a two year old will play alongside another but not really with another make sure you have enough pieces to share or two year olds will either get upset when they can not have a piece or they will lose interest . A 3 year old should be playing cooperatively though and be able to play with another child making a complete train scene together not just absorbed with their pieces. Also this set will help develop a Childs imaginary play. Daddy can go to work on the train, or your child can take the train to go on holiday.

       " '5247778::::B&Q Flower Pot Terracotta::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::24.07.2009::::     I have a couple of these terracotta pots from B Q .They cost    1.50p each and I think this a reasonable price .fair price. I have had mine identical to the ones pictured for a few years now. I have some pelargonium in mine at the moment. In the spring I had some daffodils planted in one of them. I use these terracotta pots both outside on the patio and in the conservatory. I have been known to use them to hold a rustic garden display in the house too. Description~~~~~~ I do love terracotta clay pots for my outdoor plants I think they are attractive. This 23cm terracotta pot from B  Q is a lovely natural slightly reddish brown tan colour. The inside is smooth. There is a rim of about 5 or 6 cm at the top of this clay port There is some design on the outside of the pot . The pot is smooth for a few cm then there are 3 raised lines of terra cotta clay the same colour as the pot. These lines/ridges go around the circumference of the pot. There is then some smooth clay before another 3 ridges around the pot then smooth terracotta clay to the base. The base of this pot has a central hole for drainage .I really like the simple look of these pots.Disadvantages ~~~~~~~~~ This terracotta pot needs to be put in a frost free shed over winter as it will probably crack and break if it gets frosted.  These pots will also break if dropped. Heavier than plastic ones the same size. Weight (kg): 1.6 /Weight (oz): 56.44 Advantages ~~~~~~~~ Apart from their look these terracotta pots are better than plastic ones as They let the roots of plants breathe. They are good as they help prevent water retention if the plant is over watered over watering will rot your plant roots. If cared for these pots from B  Q will last several years. Where to get these pots.~~~~~~~~~~~~ You will find these pots in B  Q with other pots and planters .They   re not available at B Q for home delivery but you could always phone your local store  reserve them and they will be ready at the till for you to collect .     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6784832:4:::6784832:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::6781514:4:::6781514:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5624457:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6290957:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::21963:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6410840:4:::6779195:4:::6771611:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6231645:4:::6231645:4:::6378505:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I bought mine in a novelty toy gift shop for a friend. This ladybird is a Tobar toy RRP    1.75. This ladybird is available in red, pink, blue, or green. I prefer the red colour. Although there is markings that make it look like 2 wings the wings do not actually flap .There are  has  6 large black spots on the wings .This toy has a cute black face cheery  features in white . It has 2 antennae too.The ladybird is made of plastic.  The ladybird has a small wind up key in its side. When wound the ladybird will dash forwards then do a back flip, landing on its base it will then spin round in circlers. After a few rotations the ladybird will repeat these movements. It is quite fun to watch this toy do its    dance    This ladybird is suitable for children aged over 3 years old it has small parts easily swallowed. This toy would be good to encourage fine motor skills as you have to twist the key to make it work. Good for someone with limited movement as it will encourage them to watch and move their eyes to watch. Altogether this is just a cheapish fun toy that will be fun. I deal as a party bag or stocking filler. Children   s party just come into my head. An ugly bug ball.

       " '5247778::::Gardman Expanding Garden Trellis::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::21.07.2009::::    As well as the trellis with a rigid frame I reviewed earlier this month I have some other trellis against a fence. This trellis is Gardmans expanding wooden trellis size 1.8m x 0.6m (6ft x 2ft). This terrace is now several years old.  * Price and availability~I bought our trellis from a local garden centre but lots of websites sell it too.  I will give you there web sites of a couple. http://www.ukgardensupplies.co.uk price    6.99 and  at http://www.webbsdirect.co.uk. Here it is for sale at    6.99p too.This trellis is available in several other sizes too, but the one I am interested in is the 1.800x x0.6metre.*material and design ~~ This trellis is made of bamboo, you can get a natural or a honey brown colour I believe you can get a tan brown colour too.. The bamboo wood is pinned together with clips that allow it to be expanded or closed up. Opened this trellis makes diamond patters with the bamboo. Closed up it just looks like a bunch of wood in a bundle together. *Why I bought this trellis~~~ I needed to support clematis up against a wooden fence. This trellis is ideal for supporting any climbing plants. *How I fixed this trellis ~~~~ I actually tied mine on with string to the wooden fence where I was attaching it, there were already a few nails and pins in the fence. I could also have nailed/screwed it on. To fix it to a wall you attach wooden batons to the wall then screw the trellis into that.*How it copes with climbing plants~~~~~ Very well really as long as it firmly attached to the fence. My clematis has grown a lot and quiet heavy. *Durability~~~~~ It seems to be quite durable mine has lasted a few years . If you can due to planting it   s a good idea to treat this with a preservative I am able to do so with some of my trellis.*Looks and success ~~~~~~ It looks pretty good (even if I dare say so myself) my plant has clambered up it and is in full bloom*Would I recommend ~~~~~~~~. Yes This is a good fairly easy way to support climbing plants up walls. *About Gardman ~~~~~~~ Gardman was founded in 1992 and has grown supplying many garden products to many on and off line garden centres. Their head office is at Spalding.   As an individual customer I do not think you can buy their products direct they sell bulk to garden centres. Thank you for reading my review.  I really do find this trellis good.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5285637:4:::6783841:4:::6783841:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5714912:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6474927:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I used a  Staedtler  ergo soft coloured pencil. There are a good range of 24 colours available in this coloured pencil. You can buy a practical storage box and clever pencil holder containing either 12 or 24 different colours This colouring pencil is a slim long one. It does have a triangular shape, 3 flat sides. The shape not only means it does not roll off the table but it is actually easier to hold hence encoraging easier writing.  These pencil crayons are wooden ones the surface of which is   non slip this also makes it easier to use.These 3mm coloured leads are strong.  Staedtler has an Anti break system (ABS) where the coloured leads are surrounded by a white protective coating this makes the lead 50  more break resistant , up to 30    stronger so less likely to break. The coloured lead is soft though and gives a soft coloured mark.  These coloured pencils are good to use [produce a good coloured mark, good vibrant colours, ideal for child   s colouring in or any adult work that needs a colour. These pencils are easy to sharpen just use any pencil sharpener. I notice through Amazon that Ryman the Stationer is selling the 12 pack for    6.24 the 24 pack for    9.99.These colouring pencils are suitable for children or adults to use.  Colouring pencils make a good gift for a child as well as being ideal to put in the case with a colouring in book or sketch pad to amuse on that wet holiday day .     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5714912:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6785596:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6775406:4:::6775406:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6542961:4:::6542961:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5690767:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6647517:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I went into Tesco and I was delighted to see some small Bromeliads in little pots.The type of Bromeliads in these pots are Bromeliad Guzmania. There are many other species of Bromeliads*About this Bromeliad-What it looks like.*Leaves A Bromeliad is a plant member of the pineapple family. The leaves of a bromeliad are long, quite thin, and spiky looking. They are a shiny green. They grow in a rosette , a spiral. FlowersThe small flower develops in the centre of this rosette of leaves. The flowers are usually in the red spectrum reds pinks purples. The flower petals look waxy they are pointed petals.  These petals almost form a cup shape .Some bromeliad flowers have a long stalk but the one I bought from Tesco does not, the flower nestles in the centre of the leaf rosette. This plant should flower for several weeks  Care This Bromeliad is a good house plant the flower lasting a long time . its suited to a house temperature and environment . All plants need water, like most plants these Bromeliads prefer rain water. Water lightly into the leaf cup, change this water after a while as you do not want the plant to rot.  But keep this plant moist.Bromeliads are a type of air plant their roots mostly used for anchoring the plant , nutrition got from the air .Propagation After the plant has finished flowering if you keep it ,it will not flower again , but you might be rewarded with pups , no not baby dogs but the Bromeliad might produce little plantlets near the base of the original plant these  will develop roots and with care you can separate and plant them. I have no idea why they are called pups*Tesco Bromeliad pot_ The bromeliads at Tesco are the ones I requested this category for. It is a small one in a plastic plant pot, this is then displayed in  simple coloured pottery pots of different colours reds purples pinks yellow white  I bought my friends a scarlet coloured flower in a lilac coloured pot. They cost only    3.00 ideal price for just a little gift. The Tesco plants all looked very attractive. This plant in a pot looks ideal on the mantelpiece or table centre. I think they make ideal gifts to buy for a friend , teacher or yourself .      ::::6702474:3:::6702474:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5624457:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::6693128:4:::6571275:4:::6571275:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6781739:4:::6781739:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6779195:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6410840:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5711672:4:::6750576:4:::5485722:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Now I suppose technically I do not own this but it belongs to the Butterfly conservation  work party that I belong to . We store this in our garage for winter work parties clearing shrub on nature reserves.  I have used this saw several times clearing encroaching shrub. This saw has an orange coated heavy gauge, oval steel frame this tapers to a point. The 525mm saw blade attaches to this. There is a quick release tension lever for this blade,  this is attached to the flat handle part of the oval frame. The orange frame of ours has got scratched with use and has a little rust  The blade is a Swedish steel blade with many hard point teeth. This blade gives a fair cut through branches and small tree trunks. I have used it at home for sawing through small planks of wood too.  This saw is quite easy to hold and use. The tapered point end does mean it gets between branches easily giving better access to the part you want to saw. This saw is a fair quality saw, I have used better and worse  saws. As with all saws it   s the blade that really counts don   t let it rust and blunt. Ideally clean between each use. Attaching a new blade is relatively simple with the release lever. A new blade for this saw is available at places like B Q, and our local shop that sells garden and home tools and hardware, blades are available from several stores on line including http://www.transtools.co.uk/store/prod_2391/garden-tools/bowsaws-and-blades/silverline-pruning-saw-blade-525mm.html. A new blade will cost from 50p to about a pound.This  saw is quite a good price it costs    3,55 http://www.powertools2u.co.uk  most other on line stores sell it  for under a fiver. Would I recommend ? Yes I think I would.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::21963:4:::6781739:4:::6781739:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5485722:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6780156:4:::6780156:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5362774:4:::6474114:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This catch ball set consists of neon green and red furry tennis ball and   2 Circular neon green and red pads these are 18.5cm in diameter.  The back of this pad has a strap which you put round the hand. Easily held by a child or adult hand. When the ball hits the pad it will stick to it, so not any good to use to hit the ball back with. A game can be played where someone throws the ball and the other has to catch it on their sticky pad, then remove the ball and throw it for the next person to catch. These pads are good for those who can not grasp and catch a ball allowing them to join in catch games.  These sets are good for encouraging and practicing gross motor skills and co-ordination.  These pads are fun to use. The balls are not too hard really as long as there are no fragile breakables in a room this set could be used inside as well as outside I have used this set with pupils who have good or poor co-ordination You can buy this toy at several places including http://www.toys-express.co.uk/acatalog/Under__5.html it costs    4.99 if you look around you will find it on sale for between    3 and    6 maybe even cheaper.

At one end it fits with a screw through a hole through a flattened end of the bow. The other end of the blade is attached to a blade holder and tension lever. This is good for a quick blade change also for safe use.Blade.The blade has many jagged teeth and is made from precision ground tempered steel. in precision ground tempered steel .Yeoman replacement bow saw blade can be bought at Wyevale garden centers too ,cost    3.49 each. The blade is a good one seems to saw well.Use .This bow saw is used when branches are too thick for loppers. This is ok with a tree that has plenty of space to manoeuvre the bow but it is sometimes a problem in confined areas as the bow handle gets caught up in the other branches where there is not much space.  This bow saw is quite good for sawing through bigger pieces of wood.My dad always said a wood fire warms you twice, once when you are sawing the wood for it once when it is alight and you are sitting by it. If you have a wood burner or open fire this bow saw is ideal for sawing your logs.How to use a Yeoman bow saw. Its best to get into an easy light rhythm sawing, don   t push too hard. A bow saw cuts on the push stroke just keep going backwards and forwards evenly applying light pressure and you will soon be through the piece of wood .     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5485722:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6601486:4:::6689593:4:::5816422:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::21963:4:::6474927:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6647517:4:::6410840:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This is a very pretty plant with   green leaves divided into spikes in a frost pattern. This mound of dark blue/green leaves have silver veins in them. A stout branched stalk will grow up from the leaves to about 60cm. This stalk will have small dense, blue cone shaped flowers these each have a spiky silver blue rosaceous collar of leaf underneath it. This plant is very attractive. The flowers are really a fantastic   Oxford blue colour.Eryngium bourgati is a native of Spain,, the Pyrenees and Med coast . It likes chalky sandy soil well drained soil so I hope it will like my Chiltern chalk. The best position for this plant is full sun. It is a perennial frost hardy   needs little water so should be simple to look after. I bought my plant for    5.99, from my local Wyevale garden centre, web address http://www.wyevale.co.uk You will find you can buy sea holly at many other garden centres on and off line for about the same price.  If you wanted to you could grow it from seed in autumn or spring seeds costing about    2.00. I hope mine will self seed on my chalky rockery bank, I expect I shall save a seed head and try to grow them from seed myself.   This plant has a long tap root and you have to be careful and dig deep if moving this plant.This plant is not only attractive to me but to butterflies and insects too, I shall be interested to see which species nectar on this flower this summer.

They respond well to him and the vehicles. I imagine my pupils must watch this cbeebies TV programmeMuck is a red bulldozer made of plastic.  This bulldozer has a red /orange coloured digger and tipper.   The tipper moves slightly will not tip its entire load the digger bit at the front better. This is fixed to the vehicles body by two arms and can be moved up and down.The front of the engine has a silver painted grill and there are two white eyes on the front too making a face like appearance. There are caterpillar tracks on Muck too, but he runs on the inner wheels.Although the friction will not really work in our soil when Muck is on a flat surface he /she will run a good distance when pushed. The children I work with love this Muck from Bob the builder and played happily with it learning and using their motor skills while playing. This toy is quite well built should last quite a long time I think. Muck is easy to wash, I know as I washed it after our session playing in the soil today.  You can buy this toy from several places on line at http://www.hitstoreuk.com/Bob-the-Builder/Friction-Vehicles/category.html?b=bob c=bob_toysandgames_friction it cost    7.99 most other stores are offering Muck for about the same price. Would I recommend? Yes bright cheerful and the kids love him     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5719918:3:::5522492:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::21963:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5255134:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6145850:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6780881:4:::6410840:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6733652:4:::6733652:4:::6212982:4:::5816422:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6781956:4:::6474927:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6647517:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5790028:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bob the Builder Friction Vehicles Dodger::::Family::::40::::helpful::::08.07.2009::::    Can Dodger help Bob fix it? Yes he can.   Vroom Dodgers wheels and the friction will make him speed along the hard floor to the next building job. Dodger moves ok on the carpet but not so fast.  Wendy can open Dodgers doors. Bob can open the engines bonnet as he thinks there might be a problem there. Dodger is a two seater truck it   s quite new. This truck is useful . There is a rotating crane fixed in the trailer this can be used to pick up those bricks with the hook at the end of the attached string. Careful try and lift the bricks into the trailer bit difficult find something with a loop on it to lift.  Before I get carried away in a world of make believe building with Dodger let me describe him. Dodger is a blue and white tow truck on Bob the Builders team. He is a friction vehicle. Size 18(l) x 10(w) x 11(h) cm. There is a crane attached which has string and a hook. Dodger   s rectangular headlights have eyes in them. Dodger is suitable for an over 3 year old to play with. I expect your 7 year old would still play with him too. I have known both younger and older children play with this toy happily. The crane with hook gives more to do than just zoomthis car around. This Born to play  toy is available from many toy shops on or off line it cost from    6.25to    10 at various Amazon sellers. Would I recommend this toy? Yes I would     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::21963:3:::5522492:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5633146:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6145850:3:::5719974:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6410840:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6290957:3:::5678412:3:::5678412:3:::5526041:3:::5526041:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::6239059:3:::6044343:3:::6044343:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5624457:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6776705:4:::6651411:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6780881:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lego Trains: Duplo Curved Track::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.07.2009::::    Lego is a Danish company in the1969 first duplo bricks appeared then in 1993 the first train tracks. Duple bricks are twice the length height and width of ordinary Lego. They are compatible though to make the transition from Duplo bricks to Lego easy also this compatibility prolongs the play life of Duplo, makes it easier for siblings of different ages and developmental stage to play together. Lego duplo is a Danish company Lego duplo train are suitable for a child aged between 2 and 5 although slightly younger and slightly older children will also play with them happily.  I love Duplo bricks Duplo is made of a strong plastic it is a safe toy.  The curved rail tracks can be bought separately or as part of a duplo train set.  To make a 58cm diameter circle you need 12 pieces of curved track. You will find the curved track usually sold in a pack of 6 pieces this Creates 58cm diameter semi-circle.  The Lego shop. .. http://shop.lego.com sells the 6 piece pack for    4.89. This is the price most other shops sell this 6 pack for.The pieces of train track are a grey plastic each piece will fit into another duplo train track piece.  These tracks are really the base of many duplo train sets they enable you to make circles, turn corners. My grandchildren have 12 of these curves to make a circle also some straight pieces to make the track more interesting. The bedroom floor has these curves taking the train around the leg of the bed while the train goes on its journey across the floor under the bed around the toy box.Your child may think they are playing, but we know better they are working, learning. While playing with Duple train tracks your child is developing their spatial awareness, developing their gross and fine motor skills, practicing their manipulative skills learning how to place and fit things together, When your child is playing it is also a time you can use to develop their language skills learning from you the correct words for fitting pieces together... Lego duplo train tracks and trains can be played with by children on their own or in a group. a child learns to play with others cooperatively a two year old will play alongside another but not really with another make sure you have enough pieces to share or two year olds will either get upset when they can not have a piece or they will lose interest . A 3 year old should be playing cooperatively though and be able to play with another child making a complete train scene together not just absorbed with their pieces. Also this set will help develop a Childs imaginary play. Daddy can go to work on the train, or your child can take the train to go on holiday. Playing out these scenarios reinforces and prepares a child for those experiences, making them safe. There are many duplo trains and carriages that can run on these tracks the ever popular Thomas as well as standard trains. Thanks for reading enjoy playing with your children and their toys.      ::::5522492:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::21963:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6448877:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::3957:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5719974:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::6145850:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6739162:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::8689:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::6197855:4:::6197855:4:::6212982:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6750576:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6647517:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6410840:4:::5816422:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This chocolate is wrapped in a silver foil then in a dark paper wrapper with pictures of the Swiss mountains. This chocolate is quite a thin chocolate with small rectangular divisions these have lines like a fork/comb has been drawn across it. The taste of this dark chocolate is not over bitter it   s a deep taste one I really like, its sweet but not over creamy like a milk chocolate. It is a sophisticated taste. If I see this chocolate again I would buy it.  Calories?  Of course it   s got lots its chocolate isn   t it, but I can see no info on this 100g bar about calories.

Under the front of the cab there are two rubber bristles these work they will pick up the grey litter balls that are provided and these end up in the waste unit. These balls can then be removed by opening the door on the waste unit . The waste unit will tilt.Bristle is a good size he is 9/5 x 15 x 8cm.We use bristle on the floor , on a table or on the road mat. I find he will, [pick up small items that we scatter to represent rubbish as well as those balls. I like this Bob the builder toy. It encourages imaginary play from the children. Also is good for their  gross and fine motor skills. Sometimes I try to encourage a child to push the vehicle to me , this is sometimes difficult for my children, letting go of the toy and pushing in the right direction.

       " '5247778::::Peony::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::28.08.2007::::    Today I am going to talk about Peonies (Paeoniaceae) not the peony tree but the herbaceous one.My first experience of the peony was a beautiful red flower that grew on a plant right outside the thatched country cottage I grew up in .it was there forever in my memory.Peony flowers come in a variety of colours but this was a dark red one. My mother was very fond of peonies. Personally as an adult these are not my favourite flower.My games and toys were simple when I was a child. I used to make perfume out of rose petals, (it really stank after being matured in a jam pot for weeks.) now the red peony made great dye. I soaked the petals in water and got  super  red designs on my clothes. (Mother was not too happy) So let me tell you about the peony. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~Although the peony grows well in this country it is not a native plant it originates from Asia and the Mediterranean.  It is a very popular Chinese flowers picture of it appearing often also it is printed on fabrics. The peony makes a wide herbaceous bush about 2 to 3 feet tall. Its leaves are dark green the leaves are a divided one. The peony is supposed to have medicinal properties Flowers~~~~~~~ The flower comes in a variety of colours reds yellows reds white.Simple flower. The patals I always think feel a bit waxy. It can be a simple flower with one or two rows of petals. In the centre of the simpler flowers you can see the stamens with yellow pollen on the tipsDouble flower~~~~~~~~~A double flower has more rows of petalsBall type flowerThe many petals form a flower that looks like a ball. Japanese peony  This form has a couple of rows of petals then the stamens in the centre look like smaller frilly petals, these ones quite pretty. Growing a Peony. It is perhaps easiest to buy a Peony plant to grow. It is possible to grow from seed or a root. Mum divided her Peony root /plant successfully   The best time to plant is in the autumn.  The root needs to be about 2 inches under the soil surface. The soil needs to be well drained peony does not like to be over wet. Put some fertilizer on every two or three years.  A peony will flower in June and JulyGeneralThe flower of a Peony is a bit brash I think. You may notice like I did that your Peony flower attracts ants, the peony produces lots of sweet nectar art love it. The ants will do no harm. You may need to stake the flowers as often their heavy head is too much for the stalk if it is windy The flower petals I remember as being quite thick and waxy. The Peony makes a good cut flower mum used to put some in the church. Their large flowers with bold colours being good for a display in a large building.

       " '5247778::::Wilkinson Sword Small Gear Action Bypass Lopper::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::02.07.2009::::    This Wilkinson sword lopper is one I have used on conservation projects and also borrowed to use in the garden. A lopper is a very useful tool for pruning and trimming hedges and bushes.   Wilkinson sword blades are very good sharp and last a long time. The blades on this lopper will cur branches 32mm in diameter. The upper blade is a non stick coated blade, this gives a clean cut. A clean cut is good so you do not get an infection in your branches. Although these blades are durable to make these blades last longer best wipe them clean of tree juices after use.The long steel tubular handles are about 76 cm /30 in they provide leverage and strength. They are good to grip having a cushioned bumper at the end. These Wilkinson sword classic loppers have a 10 year guarantee. I find these loppers easy to hold and use. They are invaluable for cutting /pruning pyracantha and Hawthorn with their fierce thorns. Good because they let you keep your distance and you can get into the hedge further than with a pair of secatuers thus cutting a longer branch off. Ideal for pruning those tree branches that are over your head and out of your reach.Wilkinson sword is an old company whose founders made guns and swords in the late 18C. They are now the second largest manufacturers of razor blades and shaving implements. If I am buying a saw or a lopper for the garden I trust this brand to make good sharp durable blades. So yes I would recommend this lopper The RRP is    19.56p but you can buy for    14.69 at http://www.worldofwilkinsonsword.co.uk. Similar prices at on and off line garden centres.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::6781588:3:::5646482:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6780370:4:::6521661:4:::6145850:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6410840:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::5362774:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Fuchsia::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::06.07.2009::::     I was in the garden centre a couple of days ago and saw their fuchsia .It brought back memories of how my mum loved them.*The fuchsia is a native of Mexico, the West Indies and New Zealand . In the late 17th century the first Fuchsias were found and introduced to Europe. From these first plants many verities have been bred.* The fuchsia flowers from June right through the summer. The fuchsia has pretty flowers they look like dancers with frilly skirts.  A thin green stalk attaches the flower to the stems this stalk swells and makes a seed case then the coloured sepals form a tube, these then split and they  curl up.   The petals make a    skirt     below this then the stigma and stamens often hang below the petals looking like lots of legs. This is the basic form but depending in the variety the flowers will have more petals, be longer fuller narrower or wider, The colours reds, pink   s, peach, white, purple   s, lilac.. Some fuchsias are single coloured some multi*Fuchsia   s can be divided into 3 groups, the hardy, the indoor pot fuchsia and the trailing.*The hardy. This one will grow outside just needing pruning in the spring . There are a few varieties of fuchsia that will grow outside. The most common one I think is the one with red flowers on. This grows very tall   can grow up to 3 metres 10 foot tall, flowering  from mid summer till autumn. This looks magnificent grown as a hedge. There are a few smaller varieties that can also be grown outside and used in the flower bed.*The Trailing I remember we always had hanging baskets outside our cottage , often they would have trailing fuchsias in them. I remember these fuchsias as bold colours. One    Swingtime    I remember the name when I looked at  the fuchsia page in my book . This one filled a basket growing 2 foot /60cm tall this is a doubled flowered red with white petals. It suits its name.  There is another trailing fuchsia that is pink too*The indoor pot fuchsia.I remember mum often had several fuchsias indoors in the summer. One would always adorn the centre of her little side table by her chair she would have a white lacy doyley table cloth and on top of it a fuchsia in a pretty pot. I remember these as pink and lilac flowers very pretty and dainty  *Care. Apart from the hardy varieties these plants do not like frost  . Dad used to keep his over winter in the greenhouse.  Water your plants in the summer but decrease the watering in the winter. In the early spring you can prune back old growth making way for new.*Thank you for reading. I must admit although my mum especially loved her fuchsias I am not over keen I prefer my flowers simpler.     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6780058:4:::5522492:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5633146:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6448877:4:::6145850:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6603737:4:::6410840:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::6733652:4:::6733652:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6312383:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5717149:4:::6647517:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6149389:4:::6149389:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6605930:4:::6474114:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The person who is first to get rid of his/her cards wins .This game produces chuckles and giggles from the players as they make the most bizarre people, A fireman with a clowns head or a schoolboy with a dress on. This game will stimulate a lot of language and discussion. Good for using with a topic about people or clothes.

       " '5247778::::Berkhamsted Castle, Hertfordshire::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::03.07.2009::::    My grandson loves his Playmobil castle so when they visited last week we said do you want to go for a walk in a real castle. He said yes so of we went to Berkhamstead castle about 5 miles away from my home. We explained to Adrian that he castle was a ruin that there were not many brick walls left. He seemed happy with that as we explained they had been knocked down by cannons like his Playmobil castle.Location~~~The castle is OS map 165Ref: SP grid reference SP996083). Very near the Berkhampstead train station. By car we entered Berkhampstead on the A41.  When we got into the centre there were signs for the castle on white hill road.There are some parking spaces next to the castle so we parked and put our welly boots and rain coats on. We could have taken a dog if we had one but it would have to be on a lead. Price and opening times~~~~~~~~~~~Entrance to the castle is free. Check http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.12219 for opening times I think there is a gate across it when it   s closed. Winter opening 10am to 4 pm every day Summer 10am till 6 pm The castle~~~~~~~~First we walked along the path on the bank of the moat around the castle. This was good as we could see that it would have made a good defence we talked to our grandson and he realized how difficult it would be to get into the castle and bash it down. There is a double moat at Berkhampstead castle. There is a little bit of water in the bottom of it We walked past a house which was the English Heritage information centre and on to the grassy courtyard of the castle. Granddaughter aged 3 said    where   s the castle   . We showed her the last remaining stones and said these were the castle walls but they got knocked down these are the only ones left.   There is enough wall left so that if you use your imagination you can get an idea of the size and outline of the castle. In some of the ruined walls we could make out windows my granddaughter still said    where   s the castle.     . My grandson looked through the windows and pretended to shoot out of them. (Boys)We explored a ruined rectangular building which was possibly the chapel.The most exciting part is the motte, the mound this is 15 metres high. We climbed up some well made steps to the top of the mound there is a muddy track too but too slippery and wet when we went. The Motte is very visible from where we entered the castle. No building on the Motte You can just about make out the circular keep. Once on the top of the mound you can see that it would make good defensive position we could see a long way also it was surrounded by a water filled ditch/moat. At the top of the mound was a well which is fenced off. From the top of the motte you get a good view of the castle lay out. We explained to our grandson that the castle walls were first built of wood.  They were built by William after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, who then gave the castle to his half brother Robert. The stone walls were built in the 12 C additions made in the 13 C.This was quite an important castle Thomas a Becket lived there. From 1155 to 1165. In 1216, during King John s reign, the castle was besieged by Prince Louis of France after 2 weeks the defense fell.  The castle became home for Richard earl of Cornwall  In 1361 the castle became the prison of King John of France.Various Queens and royal members have lived and visited this castle the last one    Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, lived here from 1469 for the remainder of her life. After her death, the castle gradually fell into decay.In 1580 Berkhamsted Place on the hill above the castle was built from stone from the ruins. By Sir Edward Carey keeper of the queens jewelsThe castle is now in the care of English HeritageThe above dates are some I gleaned from Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkhamsted_Castle there are other dates and inhabitants mentioned on that site. Also the http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/Berkhamsted_Castle.pdf site is very good for the history and gives ideas for learning opportunities.I enjoyed our walk around the castle it was interesting. The grandchildren loved it. Grandson could get some idea of castles from this even though there is so little left. Granddaughter well    where   s the castle    she said. Difficult for a 3 year old  to understand, but she enjoyed the walk and splashing in puddles.If you live fairly near or are visiting this area then yes I would recommend a visit. There is no food available on site but loads of pubs in Berklhampstead and Waitrose is nearby a picnic at the castle would be great in the summer; I just has an idea in the summer I might make a medieval picnic and take the grandkids there again. Hope you enjoyed exploring Berkhamstead castle with me.     ::::5489454:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5522492:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6448877:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6781588:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5805660:4:::6145850:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6782190:4:::6782190:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6780370:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5816422:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6410840:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6675330:4:::6675330:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::6701923:4:::5790028:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6657747:4:::6729329:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6772013:4:::6772013:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6647517:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Country Cottage::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::02.07.2009::::    Little Tikes make lots of good plastic toys. This pink playhouse is one of many playhouses that they make. I supervise play in this outdoor house most days at the moment. This house is suitable for 2 to 7 year olds.  The house is a really good solid plastic. Although it is this house can be moved  by adults children can not knock it over . 2 adults can move this house to change the position in the garden.This playhouse can be cleaned with hot soapy water.  This house is a pretty pink with a blue grey roof.This house measuring 127cm L   x   104cm W   x   131cm H is a fair size for 2or 3 children .I have known 5 children get inside it  .  The white door is big enough that an adult can get inside with a bit of a squeeze.  There are 4 windows these have white shutters on which the children can open and close. A child can just about climb squeeze out of a window. Inside the house there is some plastic equipment fixed to the back wall a sink with swivel faucet, stovetop with clicking knobs and push-button play phone.  Children enjoy having their own house a place to hide a place to play. I think this is a good house shame its pink for me really but there are others identical apart from the colour. You can buy this toy from http://www.littletikes.co.uk it costs    279 . due to its longevity I think this price is ok . You would possibly pick up a second hand one somewhere in good condition. Have fun playing with your children they would love a playhouse      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::6781588:3:::6766737:3:::6766737:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6780370:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6145850:3:::3957:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::6410840:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5690767:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6765429:4:::6765429:4:::6781345:4:::6781345:4:::5803721:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5790028:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6776705:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6452575:4:::6452575:4:::6750576:4:::6781739:5:::6781739:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Pick & Mix People::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::30.06.2009::::    This pick and mix card game from Orchard toys is good fun for children aged 3 to 7 years old. It has been around for several years now. I have played with it in a few different play settings.This game it   is available from several toy shops between     5 and    8This toy is basically a set of people cards that have been cut into 3 . Heads bodies and legs. The idea of the game is to match them up to make a complete person. There is a policeman,  a cow girl, a fireman. a pirate, a king , a clown, a boy , a girl ,a nurse There are a 12 characters in all 36 cards  but I can not remember who they are. There are several ways you can play this game depending on the level of the players . You can use this game as a simple matching game just trying to build the people correctly. You could play this with one child as a simple matching exercise like this or you could play it in a group of children with the pieces shuffled and   given out to players each player takes it in turn to add a piece of person  correctly . The person who is first to get rid of his/her cards wins .This game produces chuckles and giggles from the players as they make the most bizarre people, A fireman with a clowns head or a schoolboy with a dress on. This game will stimulate a lot of language and discussion. Good for using with a topic about people or clothes. Links with early learning goals in personal social and emotional development .This toy are made of  very strong card with a wipe clean surface the characters fun and brightly coloured.Would I recommend this game? Yes its fun     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5522492:3:::6781588:3:::6766737:3:::6766737:3:::6646674:3:::6646674:3:::6145850:3:::5750745:3:::5750745:3:::6739162:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::6214353:3:::6214353:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6241582:3:::6241582:3:::6771936:3:::6771936:3:::5719918:3:::6646083:3:::6646083:3:::6647517:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6192483:3:::6192483:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6781956:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6765429:4:::6765429:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6212982:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5719974:4:::5717149:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6776705:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The Wilkinson sword border fork I have has a lifetimes guarantee. I have had mine a few years now but if I were to buy it today the RRP is    33.46 on offer sale at many shops http://www.choiceful.com/choiceful is selling for    25.35 http://www.tool-up.co.uk is selling for r    24.99 .  Wilkinson sword make good tools The company that made swords in 1722 developed their business to make gardening tools. I trust the name Wilkinson Sword to make a good product.I use my Wilkinson sword border fork more than I do the larger digging fork. This fork has a traditional wooden shaft.  This is made of beech wood from FSC certified forests.  The green coloured handle is a Y /D shape made from moulded polypropylene. This handle is quite comfortable to hold. Much better than some other fork and spade handles I have held. I can use this fork for quite a time before I need to rest my hands from the handle. The business parts of the fork there are 4 tynes/prongs with a long metal shaft which attaches to the wooden shaft. The tynes/prongs are made from stainless steel. I find the prongs penetrate my soil easily and the soil does not stick to them.  My chalk soil  does not stick so much but my dads Cambridgeshire  clay soil is very sticky its easier to dig with a fork.  The polished stainless steel prevents the tynes/prongs from rusting. This head is not as wide as the head of a digging fork. I will be using this border fork this weekend forking around my shrubs and the front of my border where I wish to plant some bedding plants. I find this fork ideal for this purpose as it is not too big and unwieldy.  I find it is my tool of choice in a space restricted area. It will lightly turn over my soil breaking down big clods. I use a fork on my vegetable garden after I have dug it over with a spade as a fork will break the soil down easier. I do not use my border fork if digging up bulbs or potatoes as I often find I will spear them.   This fork could also be used to aerate lawns like my old dad did. A heavily used lawn or one on clay soil will benefit from this. I like my Spear and Jackson border fork it is quite light its handy for lots of forking jobs in the garden .     ::::5646482:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6781588:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5719974:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6750576:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6410840:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::5365437:4:::5365437:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6212982:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Log Cabin 4869 Playhouse::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::26.06.2009::::    Little tikes log cabin I visited a play facility a few weeks ago and they had a little tikes log cabin. Little tikes toys are popular at play venues as they are very durable. There are many varieties of little tikes play houses you will be sure to find one to suit your child or play setting    The little tikes, sorry little children, who play with this can pretend they have a log cabin in the woods or they can forget it   s a pretend log cabin and just use it as any playhouse. Let me describe this log cabin. It   s not really made of real wooden logs silly, its made of plastic. The walls are moulded plastic coloured brown and shaped /formed to look like wooden logs. The front and the back of the cabin measure 1.45 metres. The sides measure 1.22m. There are gables on the sides of this cabin. The height to the gable ridge is 1.50 metres 5 foot.. The roof is plastic pretend green planks. There is a stable type red half door in the front of the cabin. There is a window with a yellow shutter in the front wall too. The side and back walls have a window in it with double yellow shutter   s these open and shut easily. This looks a pretty neat log cabin to play in trouble is I am a bit big. I can just squeeze myself in the door, only just. There is a pretend fireplace a table and a play phone in side. With all that in and a child there is no room for me, so I will ease myself out .I hope not to get wedged in it. I then play with the children through the window little Johnny makes me a cup of tea and passes it through the window. You can let your Childs imagination take over in this log cabin. Provide them with a tea set, pretend food if you wish and a doll or two.  Then let their imagination set in. I would suggest that maybe it   s a bit small for an eight year old with friends. You will find some children pretend they are pioneers maybe cowboys or  goldilocks and the three bears in this log cabin , others will just pretend its their house a den,. but when you come down to it its all fun. This play house will clean easily withy warm soapy water, the children might like to help .  Try not to site it under a tree or the bird will leave their messages all over it . I did not put this together but I imagine if its like the other little tikes play houses its fairly simple . Now lets talk money. http://www.johnlewis.com are selling for     359.95 compare with the little tikes country cottage a similar size for    199.00 also at John Lewis If you have the opportunity to get one second hand they should be ok a little faded maybe, missing some of the furniture but because they are well made they should last many a year     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5285637:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6410840:4:::6701923:4:::5837129:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6729329:4:::6775690:4:::6775690:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6647517:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6212982:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Wilkinson sword make spades forks saws secateur   s for the garden. This make is reliably good producing an efficient and long lasting tool. Now this power digging spade is ideal it has a boron steel head rather than a stainless steel one.

This head is very strong and I find the soil does not get stuck to it. The blade is sharp and digs my soil easily.The long shaft is a strong light steel it is coated comfortable to grip.This spade is really ideal for digging the soil over and for preparing the ground for planting.

       " '5247778::::Haws Practican Watering Can::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::24.06.2009::::     Water all plants need water, so if you are a gardener a watering can is tool that will be an essential. I have a Haws 660 Practican Water Can one I inherited from my dad , he can   t have had it very long  looks quite new . I have looked on line and found you can buy this Haws watering can for    13.45  at  http://www.twowests.co.uk or    13.99  at http://www.greenfingers.com. There are several sizes of Haws watering cans this one is 6 litres it is a green colour. There is a red 6 litre capacity watering can that is designed for weed killing this has different spray head/rose.  Design~~This is a plastic blow moulded can. There is the small golden Haws logo printed on the front top of the can it has a curved handle and a spout brace. There is a moulded plastic parking point where you can pop the rose for storage. This can has a tall neck this prevents spillage so it can be held at a steep angle. The straight spout on this one although not a long one is long enough for most watering tasksRose~~~ The rose is an oval brass faces with a down spout which fits into the watering can spout. This dopes give a good spray.  If you need a replacement rose they cost    3.45 at http://www.birstall.co.uk There is a rose for weed killers that will also fit this spout it is fan shaped costs      2.98.from http://www.dobbies.co.uk. Not a good idea to use the same can for watering plants and weed killing too . Use~~~~~ This can is easy to use the handle has being designed to make it easy to carry . When full 6 litres /10 pints this will weigh 6.3kg when full I use this can in my green house for seedling and for larger plants. I use it for watering my plants that are in pots on the Patio. I sometimes use it for watering my vegetables in the veggie patch and if I put out bedding plants I will use it too. This is a useful versatile watering can.Durability ~~~~~ This is a well made blow moulded plastic the manufacturers give it a 5 years life span but personally I think longer. History~~~~~~~In ago 1886 John Haws of Clapton, London developed a new watering pot and acquired a patent. From a French design he developed a watering pot which was cleaner and easier to tip. This design has changed little since. Of course they are now called watering cans not pots . Would I recommend? ~~~~~~~~~~Yes Haws wwatering cans are good .      ::::6765750:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6739162:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::3957:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6474927:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6290957:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6378505:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Farmyard Dominoes::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.06.2009::::    Looking for something to buy a child who is aged between 3 and 6 years old? Then this game of farmyard dominoes might just do the trick. This is an Orchard toy available at http://www.orchardtoys.com. I imagine it will be available in a good toy store too. This toy costs    6 Inside a card box with pictures of some of the dominoes are 28 dominoes. There are enough dominoes for up to 4 children to play this game. Also included is an instruction sheet. The dominoes are made of a very thick card, they are difficult to bend. The surface can be wiped clean with a damp cloth if necessary. The domino is a flat rectangular shape.Each domino has 2 bright coloured pictures on it, a bright single coloured back ground and a simplified easy to recognize bright picture of a farm yard animal. There are pigs and hens, dogs, cows, cats, sheep, a tractor. The dominoes have 2 pictures on one side which is divided by a line. There are doubles of all the animals and other dominoes with two different animal pictures on them. A t the beginning of the game decide who goes first and then the child next to them has the nrxtturn decide if you will play in a clockwise or anti clockwise direction . To play this we first to put a double picture card in the centre then divide the dominoes up between the players. The first person to go is the person with a picture that matches the one in the centre. Dominoes are laid end to end. Then each in turn lays a domino, matching the animal picture at one end .If they have no matching picture then a go is missed. The winner the first person to have no dominoes left. This game is a good educational game. It will help encourage interpersonal skills, sharing and learning how to work and play with others. Simply it aids the recognition and names of animals. This game helps to develop observational skills, matching the animals. I would recommend this toy. Suitable both for home or early year s groups. Orchard toys are good manufacturers of children s toys well made and have plenty of play value. Dominoes is an old game. It is thought the game of dominoes came to England from the Napoleonic Wars, A flat tile with pips /spots up to 6 on each side of the domino. originated it is thought in China, at least as early as 1120 AD. The name is thought to have been named after priest s black and white hoods which are called dominoes. There are several domino games you can play on line a pingu one at http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/pingu/fun/dominoes.s html.

       " '5247778::::Cadbury Milk Chocolate Fingers::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::20.06.2009::::    The original chocolate fingers were made by the Burton food group which was formed in 1939, in 1986 Burton merged with Cadbury   s and these fingers are marketed under their name. I have eaten many chocolate fingers they are very popular at children   s birthday parties. These chocolate fingers are about the diameter of an adult little finger and a little longer than the little finger, the description finger fits them well as they are a rounded biscuit similar to a finger size. (I am of course talking about the standard sized chocolate fingers I believe there is a larger variety available now.)When I was a child of course there was only the standard milk chocolate finger biscuit available now in the Cadbury finger biscuit range there is a milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate caramel and crunchy variety as well as the giant finger. There are also mini finger biscuits available usually come in a pack designed for snacks.I have some of these biscuits at a children   s party recently. These chocolate fingers are usually very easy to find most supermarkets stock them. The price today is    1 at Tesco,    1.35 at Asda,    1.36 at Sainsbury   sThese biscuits are in a purple blue plastic wrapper package with dark swirls on it, the word Fingers across it. Inside the wrapper is a black plastic tray that holds the finger biscuits. Each finger about 6g has about 30 calories.Now I do like Cadbury chocolate finger biscuits, There is a reasonable coating of chocolate over the finger biscuit. These biscuits are like a cylindrical finger not a flat finger like you might call a finger of toast .So now lets take a bite off the biscuit now no sucking we don   t want a chocolaty mess . Ok, so you have taken a bite and savored the chocolate, This is a good dark chocolate flavour  not as bitter as some other dark chocolate personally I prefer a darker chocolate. the inner biscuit there is a thin shortcake finger of biscuit inside it is crisp and hard not too hard for little teeth to bite throughYes I think we all like chocolate finger biscuit Cadbury   s so keep on making them.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6145850:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6739162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6657747:4:::6766737:4:::6766737:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6723034:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6410840:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5816422:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6776705:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6647517:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

We have this toy in a special needs school Now this tunefull toy is made of plastic its very strong. The piano is red with a white keyboard. There are no legs on this grand piano as the shape of this toy is like a piano. It measures about 8  x 8  x 4 . So your child can carry this around and you could take it to granny to show of your Childs musical skills. This toy is good you can play it anywhere on the floor at a table or on the high chair table. There are 4 keys on this toy on the top of this toy Like xylophone keys are large and graded in size the. There are 4 square button keys to press to on the lower part of the keyboard. They are 4 different colours green, blue red and orange. These keys play different notes and you have to use your imagination to play along and sing along to the tune. You can not easily pick out the correct notes for any real tune. Not enough notes really. But this is not what this piano is all about. Your child is making their own first tune by tapping the keys with their fingers or a mallet. This toy is not very loud so is only a muted sound which is good as it does not get annoying Your child will be practicing not just their musical skills but their fine motor control too and could practice their colour recognition too.

       " '5247778::::International Cultural Centre, Hammamet::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::17.06.2009::::    We escaped to Tunisia in late February this year. We stayed in a Hotel in Hammamet. While we were there we visited  the International Cultural Centre. This centre is in the house and gardens which is known as Sebastian   s villa. This villa was built in the 1920   s commissioned by a Roman billionaire George Sebastian. This villa hosted many parties its guest list the royal, rich and famous I believe Winston Churchill stayed here and wrote some of his memoirs. Another famous visitor field Marshall Rommell.The villa is about 2 or 3k from the centre of Hammamet and about 4 or 5 k from Yasmine. The villa and gardens is on the coast. Easy to find really. We could have walked there from our hotel but with me still recovering from am operation we caught a taxi. Buses seen to run past the centre from Hammamet too.We went through the gates and paid a few Dina for entrance.  We paid to have a cup of tea in the house we got tickets for these.We walked along the garden paths. Very early in the season so no flowers really. I could tell the gardeners were preparing to tidy up after the winter as there was an area that had a few trees in pots ready for planting. In fact the gardens were a little wild really (that suits me prefer a wilder garden) in fact it looked as if it did need a little maintenance. We found an amphitheatre where there are concerts in the summer. I felt this would be a good music venue, a good place for plays maybe. I found an area of the gardens with a few seats and a kiosk (not open I imagine in summer they sols snacks and drinks)We only saw one other group of 4 people wandering around the grounds it was very quiet. We walked along the paths to the villa, the villa not very large really.  The Villa a simple white building elegant. The reception rooms had art exhibitions on the walls.  We looked at the art had a bit of a snoop around found one of the rooms was a bedroom.  We found a kitchen and dining room. The bath cut into the floor was for 4 people  There was an open courtyard with a couple of seats around a swimming pool. The villa uncluttered and simple. We found someone and gave him our tickets for tea. We went and sat outside the entrance on the terrace to the villas at the front looking out to sea our drinks served we spent a while leisurely drinking and watching the sea. I could just about imagine Churchill sitting here in the warm sun.This was an interesting visit. I imagine in peak season it as busier especially when there are events on.      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5719974:4:::6612341:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6729329:4:::5341620:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6760153:4:::6760153:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5690767:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6290957:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6647517:4:::6689593:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::21963:4:::5719918:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6474927:4:::6410840:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6378505:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It is a Power stretch Berghaus hat. I bought it from Millets . pm line you can buy ot for    10.79 from http://www.outdoorkit.co.ukI wore this hat in the winter on the school playground it was great kept my head and ears warm. I shall wear this hat when I go for walks in the hills when it is cold; It will help keep me cozy.This hat is made of Polartec    Power Stretch    fabric, which is extremely low bulk but has great thermal properties so it takes up little room in my pocket or back pack and does not make my head look massive. This is a stretch fabric and will fit larger heads than mine, some ladies may find it a little large but it fits my head ok, don   t think I have an especially big head. There is room to have a small turn up brim on this hat if you wish. The word Berghaus is scrawled in white on the brim it   s quite discreet. The seams of this hat are flat and smooth so they will not irritate a balding or short haired person. There is no lining in this hat When my hat gets dirty falls in the mud maybe I will be able to wash it in the washing machine. I think this hat great it will keep me cozy for a year or two as long as I don   t get sparks on it from a bonfire as I did my last fleece hat. My old fleece hat has several little holes in it.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6661912:3:::6661912:3:::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6145850:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5678412:3:::5678412:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5624457:3:::5719974:3:::6474927:3:::6689593:3:::6647517:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6410840:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6612341:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5368234:4:::5368234:4:::6617478:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5587751:4:::5013071:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The Pyrex dish I am talking about today is a glass souffl    dish. This is a 21 cm diameter dish about 10cm deep. This was one of my mother   s dishes which I have inherited. This souffl    dish is made from toughened borosilicate glass which is guaranteed for 10 years. The glass on this dish is very thick moulded around the edges to prevent chipping or easy breakage. The deep sides are ridged /fluted. The sides are not completely straight the top diameter slightly bigger than the base.The glass is heart resistant up to 300c safe to use in the Microwave, oven, freezer or dishwasher. This dish is really quite useful. Makes a good oven or fridge or freezer to table serving dish, I have cooked sponge puddings and fruit crumbles trifles as well as using it for my attempts at souffl   s. This Pyrex is easy to clean and does not stain. Flavours are not retained from one dish to the next.

They can be played with alongside the Bob the Builder friction toys I have been recently  reviewing .There are 5 figures in this collectionh Bob, Wendy, Marjorie, Farmer Pickles and Pilchard the Cat.  I saw them in John Lewis for    9.95  I am not sure where school got them from or how much they cost , but these figures by  are available  at several other on and off line shops     John Lewis price is good seen them at    10 and over . These figures have moveable heads, legs, arms, tail. They are about 10cm tall They all have moveable heads, arms and legs/tail. . I will not describe each character individually enough to say they look identical to the pictures   of these characters both in the books and the TV programes. Your child will recognize them instantly.These figures are well made and should last for years,  many play hours. They are easy to clean just need a wash in soapy water. Play value ? Yes they have lots. My granddaughter aged 3 was playing with a couple of them and I was listening to her talk, it was magical. I was interested to hear how her language was developing the concepts she was using . My granddaughter was mixing up real life situations with Bob the builder scenes she has seen. Children are fascinated by real builders and Bob and his crew, help them understand what   s going on . Would I recommend these toy figures ? yes I think any 3, 4 , 5 year old would play with them and older children too     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5633146:3:::6145850:3:::5719918:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6410840:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5708728:3:::5708728:3:::6775690:3:::6775690:3:::5624457:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5790028:3:::6647517:3:::5335750:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6378505:4:::5489454:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6445726:4:::6612341:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5334418:4:::5334418:4:::5687298:4:::5687298:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bigjigs Toys Ltd Inset Puzzle - Shapes::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::11.06.2009::::    Today I will tell you about this shape puzzle .We have one at my work place and at a school I worked in previously.This puzzle is a 21cm square non toxic wooden tray puzzle. It is suitable for children aged 3 and over. This is a thick wooden puzzle should will last many years. It is ideal for a school /early years setting it is very durable. Would I recommend for home well yes but it   s a bit boring maybe.9 shaped holes have been cut out of the natural coloured wooden base.  There are 3 rows of three shape holes across the wooden puzzle base. There are 9 wooden shapes that fit these holes. These have been coloured with a wood dye.  These shapes do not have a peg on them to assist putting the puzzle pieces in place. The shapes are a red circle, yellow triangle, Blue Square, and next row green oval, blue pentagon orange rectangle. Next row yellow rounded edge cross, red star, green cross.The inset shapes are a good size fairly easy to hold and position and a bit of wriggling around will soon help your child fit the correct one in place. I know its tempting to help your child fit the pieces but give them time to work it out for themselves. Although we find doing the same puzzle again and again boring children seem to like doing the same one again and again.This puzzle is educational. As well as your child practicing their fine motor skills positioning the puzzle pieces and practicing their hand eye coordination they are improving their memory, increasing their problem solving skills and their perception of space. This puzzle will help both their maths and literacy.  When you are with your child doing this puzzle use the names of the shapes and the names of colours. Use the words such as above, below, beside your child will soon pick up the names and positions.The downside to this toy is its price it costs    .99p from http://www.woodentoysonline.co.uk/acatalog/Educational_Toys.html. I have not found it else where on the web but I expect it is available from school suppliers. This puzzle is suitable for children aged 3 and over. This puzzle is good for older special needs children as it is shape and does not have any soppy picture which is not age appropriate. . Would I recommend ? Well yes it   s a strong, educational puzzle     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5633146:4:::6612341:4:::6145850:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5719918:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5489454:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::3957:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5335750:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5690767:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6410840:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5816422:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6647517:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This play park puzzle by Galt is one I am seriously thinking of getting. The box of this puzzle has a handle to carry it by. The puzzle is a floor puzzle measuring 45cm x 60cm (18  x 24 ). Small children find it easy to do puzzles on the floor I think it would be useful to have a large drawing board to maker it on though not just the carpet. This puzzle has 24 pieces they are large and easy to hold and fit into each other. The puzzle is made from thick board with a wipe-clean surface. It looks very durable should last a long time. This puzzle is very attractive with its bright colour and play park pictures.  The picture is very lively with swings slides, sandpit, and play house, climbing frame and roundabout a picnic bench too. There are lots of children in the park with their parents. The play park is on a green grassy area with a few trees there is a blue sky into which a few balloons are floating. There is a family flying a kite and in the background we see a few town buildings.There are many benefits to be had from doing this puzzle. Helps to increase your Childs concentration span.  Helps construction and fine motor skills.There is so much to talk about in this puzzle picture too so it will help your Childs language skills. My grandchildren often visit their local park only 10 minutes walk away from their house so this familiar scene will be interesting to them. While we are making the puzzle and when it is complete we will talk about what the people are doing. We will count the children, count the balloons, and talk about the coulours. I anticipate that my granddaughter will not need me with her to talk about this puzzle as Watching and listening to her play I hear her chatting and talking to and about her toys and puzzles. At 3 she will need a little help maybe with this puzzle , not much though as she is good at fitting puzzle pieces together , I imagine her 6 year old brother will find it very easy to do , but I expect he will join in and help her finding some interest in the puzzle and picture . This puzzle is made by Galt and Galt products are good well made , strong . and well thought out to meet childrens developmental needs .Yes I would recommend this puzzle I expect to buy it myself. This play park puzzle costs    5.85 from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Galt-Floor-Puzzle-Play-Park/dp/B0002X7YTA     5.87 from http://www.heritage-gifts.co.uk/floor-puzzle-play-park-p-9178.html.

       " '5247778::::Naturtint Hair Colourants::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::08.06.2009::::     Yes I admit it I am going grey. I coloured my hair recently using Naturtint hair colour. Naturtint make a range of 24 Permanent Hair Colorants, from Ebony black , chestnut reds through to Blondes. It is also possible to mix these colours to get your own individual shade. My hair is not a vibrant colour its a greying mouse brown. Since  this was the first time I was using this brand of hair dye I decided to play safe and  a  I chose hazel nut  blonde. they don   t do mouse brown.I bought my pack from a health store. I think you should be able to buy it from health shops chemists and on line too, one site selling is http://www.herbsgardenshealth.com.I paid    9 for a bottle of this colour. It is more expensive than others I have used in the past .., but I think I have developed an allergy to one of the other hair dyes and bored with being grey decided to test this one. This dye is packaged in a green card box and has a picture of a ladies head with long hair . In the shop was a display card with strands of hair of the different colours. This did help me choose the colour I wanted. I did an allergy test by putting a small amount of colour on my skin just by my ear. I left this for 2 days checked it, no problem so set to to dye my hair.I opened the box and found 2 bottles the large one contained the colour developer the small one the hair colorant. There was an instruction sheet too. If you have short hair you do not need to use the whole bottles full. They last a long time. My hair is long well past my shoulders. I wondered if one box would be enough. ( it was) First I brushed my hair then I mixed the colour and developer in the applicator bottle shook it fairly well.  I put on the rubber/plastic gloves that are provided and then I applied the colour as evenly as I could to my dry hair.. I wrapped my hair up into a towel I keep for dying purposes. I then   waited for about 30 minutes, its amazing how long 30 minutes is while you are waiting to wash hair dye out .Time to make a cup of tea and drink it. I was careful when I sat down as I did not want to colour my armchair too.I rinsed my hair thoroughly under the shower head, then applied the conditioner I massaged it in for a couple of minutes then rinsed my hair 2 minutes. . I used a hair drier to dry my hair   .combed and styled it. I was pleased with the result I had covered up that aging grey. I cleared up the mess I did not have any but unused mixed dye should be thrown away and do keep it out of the reach of children. I waited for my husband to come in to get his opinion, I did not tell him I had dyed my hair          . after 3 days I said have you noticed anything different about me , he looked said  humm  after a while he said dyed hair ?  Oh well I suppose that   s what you get after 34 years of marriage. When he looked he said that it looked good and covered well. I was happy with the result good coverage, hair felt soft tooNaturtint hair colorant uses ecofriendly, biodegradable packaging. They are also suitable for vegans and against animal testing. It is a gentle hair colour products with active vegetable ingredients. There is a lot of info about this hair colourant on line one site http://www.herbsgardenshealth.com/Hair_Colour_Files/Naturtint_info.htm has quite good info to check if this dye suitable for you. Do remember to do that allergy test first although I believe this dye uses less allergy causing chemicals.

       " \"5247778::::Britain's Farmyard Simmental Cattle::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::07.06.2009::::     I was playing with our toy farm the other day. Making fences sorting the animals when I came to the cows I had started to think about the makes and  how realistic they were. I realized after looking on the toy product site here that some of the cows I was lining up in the field were Britain   s Simmental cattle so here is my review. Britain   s make farm toys scale models of real tractors, and other farm equipment. Also scale models of farm animals. They make models of many different breeds of cows. The Simmental cattle are available in a 1.32 scale. I do not have one with me at the moment they are at work, but the toy must be about 4 or 5 cm long and about that height too. These cows are sold in a set of 4 the Brand / Model code is Britain   s 42351. The 4 cows in this set are all slightly different standing in different positions one with head  down to eat grass possibly The brown and white markings similar but different. I notice one has horns so it must be the bull.; these cows are real image copies so very, very lifelike in a small scale. These toy cows are made from a very hard plastic and unlikely to break. They should last some very robust play. These cows will last many years. The model Simmental cows are recommended for children aged over 3 years old I personally think a little older. Although they are a bit big to be swallowed and not toxic a 3 year old will probably put them in his/her mouth and chew the legs at least. These toy cows are great for any toy farm also they would be good for any adult displays of farms as they are real copies.  I am sure there are farm model enthusiasts out there just like there are model train enthusiasts.These toy cows like the real ones are big and bulky their coat a sandy brown and white colour. So would I recommend ? yes     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5447660:4:::5447660:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6612341:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6145850:4:::5489454:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5335750:4:::6410840:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6749875:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6776705:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6474927:4:::6647517:4:::6750576:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6739162:4:::6723034:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

The plastic mobilo bricks come in bright red, yellow and blue. These shapes are not solid shapes. But open ones. They clip together with the connectors that are included in the set.There are a range of shapes in this box .The basic cube which measures 3.5cm. There are double cubes and triangular cubes single and double size. There are flat bricks which to me look a bit like a ladder. There are several sets of wheels. The wheels come as two which are attached either side of a fixing this is the width of 1 cube 3,5 cm. With this set come several mobilo people heads these can be fitted to the bricks to make people Mobilo is easy to fit together and make an assortment of models. This construction system is very versatile. It is far easier than Lego type bricks. Although the pieces fit together easily just push and clip. They hold together securely. These bricks are great for children   s construction skills .Suitable for children over 3. They will fire your child   s imagination and help develop manipulative skills, fine and gross motor.Good for language development to learn the colours and shapes as they use them. Although the pieces  Mobilo pieces go on and on last a long time. They are a non toxic strong plastic.

Duerrs ginger preserve is a jam/marmalade that comes in a 454g glass jar with a resealable twist metal lid. The jar with its orange content is quite attractive to look at. Twist the lid open sniff and you get a sweet gingery smell. Toast ready then dip a spoon or knife into the jar. This preserve is quite thick, not runny. It has some small chunky pieces in the gel I love this spread on toast. The taste is sweet a bit sweet hubby says. It tastes lovely and gingery not over powering. If you get a chunky piece of the ginger it is quite chewy and very flavoursome. I like this preserve a lot. I just have to eat two slices of toast with this preserve on while writing this review.Calories, lots well this is a preserve jam 264 kilo calories per100g; you only need a little on your toast.Duerrs ginger preserve is free from gluten and suitable for vegetarians.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Sports 4712 Italian Football Player::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::01.06.2009::::    This Italian footballer thinks he is going to score a goal. He is a Playmobil toy footballer all kitted out in the blue and white strip with the red and green colours at the neck of the shirt that also has a white collar. . This played has dark hair brown beady eyes and a winning smile. This player can be in many different playing positions wearing different numbers several stick on numbers come in the pack with him.  A standing support comes with this footballer and he has his own football.  A paper goal target sheet also comes with this footballerThis Playmobil footballer measures   7 cm} 2.3/4 inches tall. His arms move, his hands grasp His legs will bend at the hip so he can get a good kick. This footballer is suitable for a child aged 4 and older. I actually though this football player would be ideal for a putting on top of a green iced cake with a football as a birthday cake for a football mad child or adult. This player might be a bit boring on his own so you could buy more to make a complete team you can also buy football players from different countries with their own coloured strip. I did find it a bit more difficult to find this Italian footballer for sale on the web but. Did find it at Amazon for    5.49.  My grandson a football fan of 6 owns a Playmobil England football player or two but not any other nationalities.This football player would make a great present for a football mad child it would be ideal as a cake topper. Adrian   s football player has played a major part in defending the playmobil castle and sailed with pirates. I expect he could always marry my granddaughters Playmobil princess Playmobil toys are always good value they last well only need an occasional wash with soap and water. Enjoy playing football with this Italian playmobil player      ::::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5646482:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6723034:4:::5719918:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5489454:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6612341:4:::6603737:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6739162:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::21963:4:::5308285:4:::6750576:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5690767:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6609678:4:::5816422:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6647517:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5013071:4:::6202957:4:::6202957:4:::6474114:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

There are many toys of the characters in this. One is  Skip,  a friction toy from Born to play. Skip is a lime green vehicle with a yellow skip attached to the back. The toy measures Height: 11cm Length: 17cm .  Skip is suitable for a 3 year old and over to play with and will be popular amongst Bob the builder fans up to 6 or 7 years old . You should be able to buy this toy for about    6. Amazon is selling it for    5.89. http://www.duncanstoychest.co.uk is selling for    7.99. The front of the vehicle like other friction bob the builder toys has googly eyes which jiggle when Skip is zooming along the floor. Skip has a friction engine which will when reved up make Skip zoom across the floor quite fast. Skip will work on the carpet but moves faster on a hard floor . The attached skip will swing down and is detachable press the sides together and the skip will be released. This toy is really quite robust. Easy to play with. Your Childs imagination will come into play the scenarios are endless. Have some toy bricks or some dried pasta shapes some sand or soil and your child can fill the skip up and move it around. The children I know love this toy and play happily with it and the other Bob the builder friction toys. This toy has been around for several years so you might be able to pick it up second hand, as I said its quite robust so a second hand model should be in fair condition . Go on have fun playing with this toy.

       " '5247778::::Falcon Jumbo Shaped Fish Wooden Peg Puzzle::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::31.05.2009::::     This fish puzzle is a falcon jumbo puzzle   it has only 4 pieces though. That   s because it designed for a  child aged only 1 year old.  I imagine a child up to the age of 4 would be happy with this puzzle depending on their development  We have this puzzle in the special needs school I work in. This puzzle is a wooden inset puzzle the square wooden base is 22cm x 22cm it is 3cm deep. The shape of a fish is cut out of this base and a smaller shape of a star is also cut out. The wooden base has a border of about 1cm of the plain wood.  Then there is yellow strip representing sand at the bottom this has a few green sea weeds designed on it. Then the rest of the base is blue with a few paler blue bubbles.The shape of a fish is cut out of this base and a smaller shape of a star is also cut out.  The puzzle pieces are a red star this has a few markings on it to represent a starfish. This puzzle piece has a fair sized rounded easy to grip peg attached, There are 3 pieces of puzzle that make the fish. The head is one then the body another. The third piece is the tail fin. Each of these pieces of puzzle also has a rounded peg attached. The fish has an eye and a friendly smile.  The fish is an orange colour the body having a design with other colours too. I  like this puzzle and so do the children.. The wood is smooth and the shape of the fish and the star can be felt this puzzle is quite tactile. A peg puzzle is easy for a child to use easy to pick the pieces up and place in the correct position. The pegs on a puzzle help your child perfect that pincher grip that we use in writing.   Puzzles help your child   s fine motor skills.Puzzles help your child   s hand eye co-ordination.  Working out which piece fits increases their visual spatial awareness. Doing a puzzle helps your childs concentration Puzzles like this are a good early learning too.  Would I recommend this fish peg puzzle ? Yes .

This toy often comes with a little trailer and a jointed Bob the builder figure. This is a blue vehicle with seating for one toy person. It has handle bars not a steering wheel for turning.  When this toy is rolled along the ground the googly eyes on the front jiggle up and down. This is a friction vehicle and can be made to zoom pretty fast across a solid floor.  This toy as the other Bob the builder toys is plastic its well made should last many play hours. Ideal for both home and play settings. Children really do love this toy and will practice their coordination skills and exercise their imagination.

       " '5247778::::Medina, Hammamet::::Travel::::40::::helpful::::29.05.2009::::    As I have mentioned before we escaped to Tunisia for a break this February I was convalescing after an operation. We stayed at Hammamet one of the places we visited was the Medina, Medina actually means old town. This Medina is next to the fort on the sea front easy to find The medina is really a market contained within 15centuary walls lots of tiny shops very close together and a few houses too. The blue painted doorways in the white door surrounds are very attractive. These doors are often pictured on Hammamet post cards, The area of the medina is not very large a few narrow streets. It was not very busy when we were there but it was only Feb not main holiday season.  . The shopkeepers would mostly be standing idle in their doorways chatting to neighbours and trying to tempt us into see their wares. They would say come into my shop see my good Turkish good cheap price. It was expected that you would haggle the price down with them. To be honest I did not want any tourist nik naks , no carpets no jewellery, no Turkish delight , no tee shirts , no sandals, no hand bags  To be honest mr Turkish shop keeper I might have looked round your small shop if you were not in my face haggling . Mind you I did not blame them they had a living to make it was early season     and there were not many tourist around. We said no thank you or politely ignored looked the other way so they got the message we were not buying.    Once we made it obvious we were not interested we were not hounded. This was an attractive area with the white painted shops and the  brightly coloured clothes or jewellery hanging up . Even though I was  not tempted to buy  I am glad we walked around a few streets .  This area really is a tourist trap at one time I guess it sold real items to the locals; I imagine no local people  shops in this medina now.      ::::6661912:3:::6661912:3:::5633146:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::21963:3:::5489454:3:::6745054:3:::6745054:3:::6145850:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6750576:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5106804:3:::5719974:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::6410840:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::5699516:3:::5699516:3:::5719918:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5663726:3:::5663726:3:::6214353:3:::6214353:3:::6646083:3:::6646083:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6766737:3:::6766737:3:::6378505:3:::6647517:3:::6474927:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::5085343:3:::5085343:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6599475:4:::6599475:4:::6399479:4:::6399479:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tobar Clockwork Wriggly Snail::::Family::::30::::helpful::::28.05.2009::::     I have been playing with snails, not the annoying ones in my garden that eat my young plants but the clockwork snails from Tobar toys.These snails are available from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tobar-Clockwork-Snail for    1.50. Also available in some shops selling pocket money toys. These snails are available in green or orange not really realistic colours. The snail measures about 7cm. The snail has its curvy snail shell and a head which will bob in and out when you wind it up by the small twisty key in the side of the snails shell.  Although this snail does not whiz along the surface it moves a bit faster than a real snail. These snails are suitable for children aged 3 and over.  3 might be a little young. You will need fine finger control to be able to twist and turn the keys on this toy. These snails are ideal for stocking filler or a party bag. These would be good to use with a disabled student for eye tracking eye movement exercises.   If you have a group of children with these you could have snail races (an alternative sports day event maybe.) These snails are fairly durable will not fall to pieces as soon as you touch them like some cheap toys, however do not expect those to last for many years.Would I recommend these ?

       " '5247778::::Cetirizine (zirtek)::::Health::::50::::helpful::::20.02.2004::::    Sorting out my medicine box I found a few of these and realised I had not yet posted an opp on Zirtec/Cetirizine on Ciao so here goes.Yes you guessed it I have hay fever. It starts the end of May beginning of June and goes on till the middle of august. I know one of the pollens I am allergic too is stinging nettle whenever I pass by a bed in bloom my eyes start itching and I sneeze. I am not sure which other pollens effect me. I never had hay fever till I was 25 after a serious car accident and a location move to bucks. If either of these had any relevance I don t know but they all happened about the same time. So what do I do about it? I take Zirtec. I have only been taking it for the past 3 or 4 years. When I first had hay fever I took some tablets that were really good I can t remember their name and they got taken of the market several years ago. I tried Claritin after that .for me they were useless. Went to the doctor who prescribed zirtec brilliant no snuffles, sneezes, and best of all no itchy eyes. Zirtec can be bought over the counter in tiny packs of 7 but they are really expensive I get lots on prescription much cheaper I get a repeat prescription I pick up from my doctors surgery saves her and my time  8217;s have to go to see her about every other year to get this renewed. I find that taking zirtec is good, as my insect bites do not itch either. In fact dearly beloved takes my zirtec when he gets badly bitten. Zirtec are very small easy to swallow little white pills brilliant if you have a problem swallowing pills sometimes I do not even need a drink to ease their taking. I take one a day in the morning as this is a regular time that I remember. There is a warning not to exceed stated dose. zirtec does not cause drowsiness in most people but if you are one of the few zirtec makes drowsy do not drive or operate machinery. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor.

       " '5247778::::Clarityn::::Health::::30::::helpful::::19.09.2005::::     I was tidying out my medicine box and found an old packet of Claratyn so thought I would tell you about my experience of them. Claratyn are a tablet for allergy sufferers mostly taken for hay fever.  They can be bought over the counter at chemists or you can get them on prescription. One year my Doctor prescribed them for me for my hay fever as the Trilidan I had been taking previous years now had health scares  I get very itchy eyes and sneeze embarrassing explosive sneezes. He also prescribed opticrom eye drops for me.The Claratyn tablet come in blister packs. They are very small 10 mg round white tablets very easy to swallow.  The dose is 1 a day.I know some people find these effective for their hay fever but not me My eyes still itched and I did sneeze.  I used the eye drops they helped a little but itchy eyes are so agonising. These tablets contain loratadine and are a non-sedating antihistamine. They can have some side effects hair loss, a change of heart rhythm, tiredness nausea and headaches. I did not suffer with any of these. Thinking about it I was tired though, (hubby says I am always tired.) however I did not find them very effective for hay fever. While I was on them nettles stung me and the tablets eased the sting, also they helped to calm my midge bites. If you have allergic reaction to other things the DR might prescribe these for you. The Dr suggested I try Zirtec after I told him these were not effective and the Zirtec are much better my eyes do not itch at all and my sneezing is most modest. I shall take this old packet back to my chemist tomorrow for them to dispose of safely      ::::5588196:2:::5606177:3:::5643371:3:::5643371:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::5390480:3:::5390480:3:::5645952:3:::5645952:3:::5295459:3:::5643454:3:::5373212:3:::5373212:3:::5260499:3:::5717599:3:::5717599:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5359767:3:::5247505:3:::5247505:3:::5579719:3:::5579719:3:::5660058:3:::5217966:3:::5217966:3:::5545990:3:::5545990:3:::5624912:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5661865:3:::5661865:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5584168:3:::5498542:3:::5498542:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5621700:3:::5281759:3:::5281759:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::5624457:3:::5602693:3:::5602693:3:::5366673:3:::5371022:3:::5373984:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5633146:3:::5676748:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5567284:3:::5567284:3:::5715696:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5690300:3:::5690300:3:::5699751:3:::5699215:3:::5705753:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::5646036:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5326632:3:::5326632:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6769280:4:::6769280:4:::5365839:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5285637:4:::5353033:4:::5550344:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5314908:4:::5022091:4:::5341731:4:::5499641:4:::5566929:4:::5566929:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5631644:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5332464:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Haslet::::Food & Drink::::20::::very helpful::::27.05.2009::::    I wanted something for hubbies and my work sandwiches. I had got bored of the same old things and noted some Haslet in the packed cold meat section .Its ages since we had Haslet. So since it was very cheap 64p for 125g = 51p per 100g I decided to buy it thought we could save some money too. For those of you who do not know Haslet is a seasoned and cooked pork roll. The pork is a bit like sausage meat I suppose. This Haslet came in a plastic vacuumed packet . The Haslet in round slices were a brown colour with a few flecks lighter and darker brown in it.I seem to remember there were about 8 slices in the pack. Lifting a slice onto my slice of bread I noticed it was very soft and soggy was not too impressed ,it fell to pieces too easily. I could have added some salad to my Haslet sandwich but I had none. At work I ate my sandwich to be honest I was not impressed it was slightly spiced a bit herby containing Onion Pur   e, Onion Powder, Black Pepper, Basil, Marjoram, Oregano, Thyme, Coriander Extract, Nutmeg Extract, Pepper Extract, Sage Extract, Thyme Extract. The herby mixture taste was ok, not good though not very strong flavour. The other ingredients were 70  pork, water, wheat flour honey, potato starch, yeast extract and some preservatives. There are 220 kcal per 100g. This meat needs to be refridgerated and eaten within 2 days of opening and before the use by date . Sorry Tesco the taste was ok ish but there was no bite to the meat I shall not be buying this Haslet again. This Haslet was not like my memory of Haslet bought from the butchers I guess   I shall perhaps try another Haslet one day from a different source .       ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::6145850:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6609678:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6214353:3:::6214353:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6769280:4:::6769280:4:::6720144:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5790028:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6474114:4:::6410840:4:::6671773:4:::6750576:4:::6723034:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5719918:4:::5719974:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6394303:4:::6394303:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6474927:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5568585:4:::5568585:4:::6218348:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6605930:4:::6647517:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tunisia - Holiday (Tunisia)::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::26.05.2009::::    Hammamet My husband and I were both recovering from illnesses, well mine is surgery on my foot. Both of us fed up decided to book a last minute week   s break in Tunisia. We booked on the Thursday flew on theSaturday.  We have never visited Africa or Tunisia before but decided the weather in Feb would be warmer than here.  We were looking forward to visiting somewhere different. We booked At the Barcel    hotel recently name change from Miramar we usually camp.  Hammamet has several hotels offering BB half board or full board.  Getting there______We flew from Stanstead to Monastir   flight about 3 hours. Monastir is about 1 hour and 15 minutes from Hammamet by the bus that picked us up. There is going to be an airport at Hammamet soon work is in progress. Tunis airport is a bit further in the opposite direction can   t be further than 2 hours away. Most other large UK airports fly there too. If you book package you will have a coach to the resort. Taxis are available at the airport. Entering Hammamet we first drop some holiday makers at Hammamet Yassmine this on the coast on the outskirts of Hammamet about     hour from centre. Our hotel little bit nearer the centre.Money____ We took travellers cheques and a few English pounds with us as you are not allowed to bring or take out of  the country more than 2 Tunisian  Dinar. We found that the price of items quite good a bit cheaper than the UK. Going out one lunch time for a meal we found a tourist restaurant charging UK prices but went to a local caf    where we ate much cheaper.   I heard people say that there would be lots of people in Tunisia offering to do things for you such as carry cases and they would expect paying. This is very true. We found them quite insistent. In the towns people offering to show us places and we were going to look at an archaeological site one day and some school kids latched onto us offering to show us the best places to go. It could have got annoying. Haggling yes   unless things are a fixed price it is ok to haggle. Things like carpets, pottery can be bought much cheaper than the price first asked. Beach ___ The beach was glorious a long wide stretch of golden sands, not too busy in February but I imagine very busy in peak times. There are several cafes along the beach with rush parasols for shading customers. We saw a lonely camel and his owner walking along the beach offering rides, the equivalent to our sea side donkeys.  The sea a glorious blue. In season I imagine many happy hours could be spent on the beach in the sun. There is a lot of water sports available to partake in equipment can be hired locally. We were not visiting at the best time to sun worship but it was pleasant to stroll along the beach. The beach looked clean the hotels cleaning up their beach spaces, but this was very early season so I not sure how it would be in the height of summer. Buildings______ Entering Hammamet we first drop some holiday makers at Hammamet Yassmine this on the coast on the outskirts of Hammamet about     hour from centre. Our hotel little bit nearer the centre. A lot of the hotels , ours included had beach access  As we enter the town of Hammamet there are a few more hotels a few bars , some  small shops  .  Something that was striking were the doors Tunisian doors are interesting obviously pride taken in them attractive with designs on them Hammamet   s houses and buildings usually painted white with blue windows, door surrounds and shutters.  . By our standards Hammamet did not look like a wealthy town.  Houses were small, hotels not high rise blocks. Fort ____  There is an old stone built fort next to the Medina 4 solid square walls cost a couple of Dinars to go in. walking on the walls of the fort gives great views out to sea .International Cultural Center___________ This is a villa built in the 1920s by an Italian prince ,.In the 20   s and 30   s this was a popular place for the bohemian intellectuals and writers  to visit , visited by Churchill, Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, King Edward and Mrs Simpson Hemmingway and Churchill amongst others.  Music festivals and art exhibitions are now held here. It has a large garden to wander around too. I imagine at one time these gardens magnificent but althougf they still hold interesting plants really does need some maintenance.  This is before the summer season though so maybe it   s just the end of the winter before the spring summer garden work is done. This was an interesting walk around and the atitheastre looks a good place to hear music in season. We looked at the art work in the villa and had a drink sat on the porch overlooking sea. A pleasant place to stop.Shopping. The shops in Hammamet were all small, tiny indeed selling cheap tourist goods. Some small supermarkets (I use that word loosely) selling bread pasta soaps everyday goods. The medina is a place you will probably head for. The medina the ancient part of the town is a few narrow streets with small shops closely packed in together. Shops selling shoes selling clothes, jewellery. Leather goods, shops selling herbs Saffron is grown locally a lot cheaper than buying in England. Shops selling   tourist tat.  You will get shop keepers asking you in and offering you things to buy, to come and look. Definably haggle here There are many archaeological sites surrounding Hammamet. The excavations of the Roman settlement of Pupput. On the edge of Hammamet we did not visit this one though. Getting around in Hammamet ._____ There are many taxis in this town all a cheap price ask price before you take one though. There is also the tourist Noddy train running from the Medina as far as Yassmine Hammamet. A train station in the centre trains going to   other Tunisian towns.Driving _____ We hired a car for the week we were there so we could explore further.    However we did not go to the desert area, there are trips arranged usually stopping over for one or two nights. We did not go to Tunis to visit Carthage might have done if it had been raining local to us, Tunis was 2 hours or more away the time we decided it was not worth the time when there was enough to do and see locally that we had never seen before and might possibly not get the option to see again. For my husband driving in Tunisia was an interesting experience. There was a dual carriage by pass around Hammamet  we had to drive on this for our hotel  and  we saw several cars going the wrong way along the roads cyclists on the wrong carriage way,  traffic was all over and everywhere  . So expect the unexpected eyes needed everywhere other road users doing the most bizarre things. We saw a lot of Donkeys and carts as it was time for harvest and crop collection from the fields. Donkey carts were fully laden. From our observations I would judge that a lot of Tunisians did not own a car as we a lot of local people and children walking back and from work and school. There were police stopping and checking cars eveywhere . we were slightly nervous but we assumed as we noted hire cars were not being stopped that they were only stopping locals . Asking our  holiday rep I  found  I was correct.Food _______ We had half board so did not really buy much food out of our hotel. We did buy bread and crisps.  Tinned sardines, some cheese from a local shop for picnic lunches. We also ate at a caf    on the edge of Hammamet. Here we had a brick.    A brick is a pastry pie   ours had an egg in the centre and some meat too, it was interesting. Yes we liked our bricks. There are several different types of bricks all with egg but with other fillings with the egg cheese or tuna amongst them.  The food at the hotel was very good. It was not as spicy as I thought it might be.  We had quite a lot of fish, being as we were beside the sea that might have been expected. A lot of salads were offered to some at breakfast time. Some of the meals were traditional Tunisian foods. Tunisia is a Muslim country so although we could buy alcohol and it was available at the restaurant it was not especially cheap.People ______ We found the Tunisians helpful and friendly.  Being a Muslim country the ladies were clothed appropriately, an age difference under 30   s wearing European style trousers and tops the older ladies more traditional dress heads covered.  So although at the beach its fine to expose your legs ladies it might be better not to in the towns. Although we enjoyed our holiday it was good for us I did not need to do much walking after my opp.  A good place to escape to for a rest somewhere different. I doubt we will revisit as   . The coast line is getting increasingly built up. Most of the other land locally is agricultural and not really accessible for lots of walking.  Also because it   s dry in the summer and because of agriculture not so many wild areas to explore. For a bird watcher the sea watching is fairly good.       ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6145850:4:::6723034:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719918:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6218348:4:::6736381:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6759284:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6603737:4:::6474927:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6739162:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6647517:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6410840:4:::6750576:4:::6287172:5:::6287172:5:::5699516:5:::5699516:5:::6690515:5:::6690515:5:::6600809:5:::5649437:5:::5649437:5:::6378505:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Boots Finger Bandage and Applicator::::Health::::40::::very helpful::::25.05.2009::::    Ouch ouch ouch it hurts. I had a little accident last week I fell over and my finger got bent right back, it did hurt it flaming hurt lots.  I did not think it was broken but knew best to try and bind it to the finger next to it so I did not keep trying to use the finger and it hurting. I was not sure how best to do this. The first thing I did was look in my first aid box. I found a Boots finger bandage and applicator. I decided I would bandage my poor damaged finger. I bought this a long while ago for a different finger emergency. Plenty of finger bandages left. There is 4 metres of 1.6 wide finger bandages. This bandage comes as a tube just the right width for a finger to be poked into. There is also an applicator this is a piece of plastic which fits over the finger. This applicator certainly makes applying the bandage easier. I  cut of a piece of bandage about 3 times the length of my finger .Then put the applicator over my finger and rolled the bandage tube down over the applicator as it shows in the instruction leaflet it also shows how to  tie the bandage to your finger but I stuck mine on with some  tape . The bandage is a soft one comfortable to wear. Because it comes in a long skinny tube you cut of as much as you need. Will fit large or small fingers. This did give my finger some support it was fairly easy to apply considering I did it on my own finger and a finger on my right hand at that (I am right handed.()So I did not bend my finger I taped it to the next one. A bit difficult to even tie my own shoelaces now. However I managed at work and my finger is a lot better now still sore a bit when I bend it.  . Finger bandages are useful for protecting poorly and cut fingers. I have used them before on wounds These tube bandages are so much easier to apply than a long strip of bandage  to a finger. The applicator certainly makes applying the bandage easier. This finger applicator is really very good. I would certainly recommend one for your first aid kit.  . The one I used is a boots one it costs    3.49 The packaging has changed recently to a  green lid instead of the red on the pack.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5624457:3:::6647517:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5719918:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6769280:4:::6769280:4:::6742938:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6145850:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6775858:4:::6775858:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5690767:4:::6474114:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6378505:4:::6749875:4:::6739162:4:::6474927:4:::5489454:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Although these biscuits are available all the year round somehow they seem to be traditional Christmas and New Year treats. The tins and packets patterned in a traditional red Scottish tartanI have eaten many styles of walker   s short bread biscuits the traditional round shortbread that is divided into segments, Small round thick shortbread biscuits, shortbread triangles. One I have sampled is the shortbread with stem ginger pieces.  I shall be telling you about these ones now.  Walker   s shortbread with stem ginger is a fantastic biscuit.  The fairly large round shortbread biscuit quite thick has a few pieces of stem ginger baked in it.  Bite into the crisp biscuit it is a lovely buttery shortbread flavor, not too crumbly and then embedded in the shortbread are some small pieces of stem ginger. I seek these out with my tongue from the mouthful of shortbread that I have. The small pieces of ginger are quite moist and chewy they impart a lovely ginger flavour to my taste buds. I take another bite, these are fantastic biscuits. Eating these biscuits makes me feel warm and secure imagining winter night   s snow and cold outside and families sitting round an open fire safe and warm inside eating these scrummy Walkers shortbreads with ginger pieces in them. These biscuits go down well with an ice cream or mousse type desert, or just with that cup of teas or coffee. These walkers shortbread with ginger pieces in them are available at large supermarkets, John Lewis and some other stores have them in their Christmas fare selection.

       " '5247778::::Tobar Squishy Bog Frog::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::18.05.2009::::    If you saw one of these squishy squashy warty frogs you would not be able to resist picking it up and giving it a squeeze.  This frog is a  fun rubbery sensory toy We have some of these yucky frogs as sensory toys.  These 8cm frogs are rather cute.  They have 2 eyes and a mouth which gives them a mischievous expression. These frogs come in yellow pink green and a red purple colour.  Each frog has warts lurid pink shiny warts. These warts are exposed through holes in the frog   s skin. I can   t remember now as these frogs are snowed in at work but I think there are about 6 or 8 warts per frog. The skin of the frogs is a tough rubbery material squashy and to be honest doesn   t feel that good but it   s an irresistible horrible yucky feel. When the frog is grasped and squeezed the warts are squeezed and pop out of the holes    (not completely they stay fixed inside the frog) I think these frogs are made with an inner rubbery ball which when the frog is squeezed the rubber oozes through the outer circular wart holes .Each these frogs are revolting, the sort of revolting children like.As I said we use ours as a sensory and cause and reaction toy  , some are in the swimming pool .  Some special needs children need to be introduced to different textures to  their touch to make them more aware of the world.  If we did not give them different textured  toys they might never feel something like this . To be able to touch and feel what   s safe to detect hard and soft rough and smooth. To be able to connect how something looks to how it feels ,things we know because we have touched and felt things which look similar before. We kbnow through  experience and just looking at this frog its going to feel a bit yeuchy rubber squidgy and squashy  This frog is good to expend a childs language too .Use all those descriptive words ask them how it feels give your child those words for describing it . We tell our non verbal children its safe but feels   soft and squidgy they can squeeze it . This helps understanding of the language and they will know what to expect next time they are told something is  soft and  squishy .These frogs would make a good stocking filler or joke present suitable for children over 6 years old .  They come individually in a net bag You can buy them from http://www.amazon.co.uk/ Amazon for    1.13 each   You can also buy from http://www.tobar.co.uk where they are sold in a display box of 12. I think you can buy these in those joke type high street shops too . Would I recommend ? Yes these frogs are great, in a funny horrible sensory sort of way .     ::::5459724:3:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6647513:4:::5646482:4:::6145850:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5722403:4:::5722403:4:::6758309:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::5719974:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6603737:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::5489454:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6733652:4:::6733652:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6716669:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5719918:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5786498:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6394303:4:::6394303:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6312383:4:::6410840:4:::6647517:4:::23249:4:::23249:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6617495:4:::5790028:4:::6378505:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6759284:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Everything that starts with Q ...::::Ciao Caf�::::30::::very helpful::::18.05.2009::::     You can thank Richarda for this review, he pointed out I was near the 1000 review mark and suggested I write a review on this topic. I asked people for their questions and duly am answering them. Richarda starts the ball rolling with 1/Q) what brought you to Ciao in the first place and what motivates you to carry on writing here? A) My daughter discovered Dooyoo first and I began writing there too.  I then discovered ciao and the bug bit I find writing and reading reviews addictive.   It   s a bit like talking over the garden fence with a neighbour. You will find a lot of my reviews are about toys. I have worked for over 30 years with children so have much knowledge about toys. I like to think by writing these reviews I might encourage parents to play with their children to spend time with them.Motivation ?.  Well the money of course it   s an incentive   I don   t earn a great deal here but enough to spoil the grandchildren a little. Also I do think the community is good     talking     making friends.I joined in October .20022)  Bnibbles shines a table light in my eyes and asksYou mentioned cycling across the fens - is that where you came from?A) Not quite the Fens I grew up in a thatched cottage in a small country village half way between Cambridge and Huntingdon the edges of the fens. As a child I used to cycle everywhere first to the village shop on my red tricycle alongside my mum. Then as a young teenager on an old boneshaker I ventured out of the village into the fens .Lovely roads, no hills. I would cycle either with friends or alone.  Now I sometimes cycle my Claud Buttler in the Chiltern hills3) Sewbizzie asks what the most embarrassing thing you have ever done is. A.) now that   s a difficult question. I do not get embarrassed easily . I was about 9 or ten when I thought I was in the local county sports on my schools team doing high jump. I got on the bus no one said anything then.  When the teacher checked all the competitors were present, she asked me why I was there I said I thought I was in the high jump she said no that   s Jane.  I shrivelled into my seat she said never mind you can be substitute if we need one  . They didn   t 4) Arnoldhenryrufus asks if you could retire today and be totally debt free, what you would want to do with the rest of your life. Also if you could go back in time, what in your life would you like to change? A) Not long till retirement now really I hope to retire in 5 or 6 years time.  What would I do with the rest of my life? Well travel some more not having to rely on school holidays its amazing how much cheaper holidays are out of term time. Probably although retirement would be debt free my mortgage paid of my pension will not be large so would not live an extravagant life.  Not working would mean I could go to all those music gigs weekdays and attend more music festivals getting home early Monday morning after a weekend camping, drinking and listening to music means I am exhausted at work for a day or two after. Yes I would  go to all those festivals , Glastonbury V and the rest  , let my long grey hair down and rock on  till I dropped . I love my garden and gardening   . Having more time I would take on an allotment.Going back in time what would I change? Well I would not go in my friend   s car the day we had an accident that leaves me with a permanent double image through eye injury.I am fairly happy with my life decisions a few minor tweaks maybe. Thanks for those questions Lyn5) marymoose99  asks me you   re stuck in a lift with 4 Ciao members - who would they be and why. A) Difficult to answer I guess I would like to get stuck with Richarda. We have read rated commented on many of each others reviews and although I do not share his interest in cars I would like to hear more about the places he has visited. Next person probably would be micksheff. I think we would also find that we liked the same sort of places and watching wildlife. Two ladies next yourself Mary   we could talk till the moose come home, and then Susan Lesley too. Susan was amongst those here who were a great help to me when my dad died I wrote about it quite a lot on here. There are so many more people here I would be happy to be stuck in the lift with difficult to chose who really,  lets get a bigger lift and we could all get stuck for an hour or two .6) A question on a similar theme I think from Jo x jo145 Are you attracted to any male on Ciao and if so if you could meet him where would your dream date take place? Or which females would you like to meet for a girly day out.A) I am not looking for a male mate on ciao and am happy in my marriage so  this does not really apply I could have and enjoy many platonic dream dates with many of the males on here but think I would choose a girly day out . I doubt IF I could keep up with the younger girlies on here. Maybe grafter123 and I would go for a walk looking at flowers in the sunshine Chiltern Hills then go to Champneys on the edge of Tring where we would meet with all the other girlies her on ciao  7) Gladiator007 asks me a question about friends the TV programme. sorry I can not answer as I do not watch he also asks .You just have been awarded    500 from premium fund(for your excellent contribution on CIAO over the years), and you already have decided that you will keep    200 for yourself and rest of the    300(   150,    100,    50) you will distribute to the three members (those who always have been loyal, helpful and very friendly with you so far and definitely write quality reviews), so who are they and why you have chosen them?   Now That really is too difficult There are so many members, friends who would qualify  so I would  spend  the money on food and wine and invite every one round to my garden for a  summer feast  a picnic   so that we could all celebrate.  I would probably need more than the    300 for the big party.8) Question from suisie is, as a child what was your favourite toy and your favourite game and do you think your grandchildren would enjoy them as much as you did? A) As a child 50+ years ago we did not have so many toys.  I can only remember a few. I grew up in a country village so most of my games were outside ones. I was not a girly girl although I had a couple of dolls I did not play with them much. I had a dolls pram I loved this, but not for my dolls my rabbits used to get pushed round the village in it. I had a pair of stilts which dad made I loved walking on these. Above all I loved playing on the village green making dens, climbing trees. My granddaughter is a girly girl and plays with her dolls a lot so think she will be happier playing with her dolls. My grandson well he shows enjoyment digging in the garden playing with the soil   so I think he would enjoy the games I played more.9) tallulahbang asksI know you re a big fan of Glastonbury and other festivals, so what has been the best festival/live band you ve attended and why?A) Best festival well lets see was it my first a Reading one in 1973 . I was 18 ,not really it was exciting for me yes but Glastonbury certainly wins hands down. Which year? Which band is a bit difficult they all blend together? It would not have been a muddy year as its hard work at a festival in the rain and mud. I guess  I can not remember which year but the first year Prodigy played stands out as maybe not the best but one of the best. Why Glastonbury well it   s a weekend of freedom   , good vibes    friendly and lots and lots of variety and different music and acts.  Sad not going this year has not been well so did not get tickets as was not sure I would be up to it.10) Mickie 26 asks me. What is the worst mistake you have ever made on Ciao and what is the best thing you ever did on Ciao?A) I have not really had any problems here on ciao. My worst mistake would be not writing more comments on people   s reviews and not reading enough too. The best thing well joining ciao.  My only diamond was on a review I wrote about the Robi nit comb in September 2004 it was called nit picking.11) doc prov asks, what you did in your childhood that got you in most trouble.A) Me get into trouble?   I was an angelic child. Seriously I can not remember getting into much trouble.  I do remember one Christmas when I was about 8  though I don   t know what I had done but I ran out of the house Dad chased me all round the village . I was then sent to my bedroom. Can not remember what I had done though.12) wrigglylittleworm asks what the favourite review that you have written is. Why do you like it? Are there any reviews that you have regretted writing? A) Gosh there are so many to choose from. None I have regretted writing. My favourite review; that would be none again so, any I have no real favourite sorry13) hiker asks a difficult question - Assuming that you had to live your life over, and you HAD to change one major choice that you made, what would it be? (And why,   how do you think it would have turned out?A) Major choice?   Happy with my choices really. Love the man I married 34 years ago.  Not sure about having more children after our first baby died and I  gave birth a year later to our daughter now 32 we decided not to have more  just in case  next baby would die like 1st, would have liked more children , but it was too traumatic to have another . Maybe I would decide to try for another baby. A couple of years gap between children would not want to big an age difference and no not now.   So yes If I had to I would have another baby  on reflection I think that all would have been well. How would it have turned out well just fine   .We would have been poorer, children cost so much hopefully it would have been a boy.14) Tractor boy asks - You ve been a member of Ciao for a good few years now and written many, many reviews, how has Ciao changed since you were a new member?  Ciao has revamped its pages several times since October 2002 when I joined. I do not remember guest books back then. Generally the essence of ciao has not changed. People writing reviews to try and earn a few extra pennies or make friends, to research consumer items.I think it is fairly friendly on here not changed that much, Guess I shall amble along these review pages a bit longer.15) Cats holiday asks _. What about; is there any time in your life you would like to have again? Thanks SueA) Difficult one Sue would it be my childhood a happy one climbing trees no worries no fears. Most likely it would be my teen years from about 18 to 21. I met Love of my life we lived in a shared house in Bradford friends around us all the time a mostly happy time full of love16) plod591 asks , Where   s my favourite place in the U. K? A). I have several favourite places. The village Green at Hilton where I grew up.   The West coast of Scotland around Arisaig fantastic area. It could be the Yorkshire moors or the Cotswold Hills. Lastly My own back garden here in Tring.  Notice all country places not town.17) Pmcds asks a question. Do you ever get writer s block whilst reviewing? If so, how do you cure it? Thanks Phil. I do occasionally get writers block. I cure it by not writing for a few days and spending more time in the garden. Outside with the plants the birds and the butterflies usually clears my head.19) This I received at the last minute from Grafter. I get the feeling that you were a bit of a hippy when you were young. Is this correct? If so tell us a little about your experiences. :)Yes Grafter although I was really in my teens in the seventies I was a bit of a hippy chick. I would like to state at this point that I was never into drugs.Did see a lot of misuse of them though. I left school in 1970 when I was 16 went to college. Between the age of 16 and 21 I would be seen hitch hiking usually some where between Cambridge , Peterborough and Bradford. I lived in a small village just off the A 14.  My clothes a long maxi skirt sometimes cheesecloth sometimes velvet, a cheesecloth smock. Black velvet jacket, Purple maxi coat, brightly coloured loons ( wide bottomed trousers) My hair long sometimes braided with ribbons in it .  I often wore lots of beads round my neck, my wrists my ankles. I often wore no shoes and I wore no bra. I was a free spirit wanting to free myself from societal restrictions, choosing my own way, and find new meaning in life. Questioning  authority, respecting individual rights. I have been on several anti war demonstrations and demonstrating against nuclear arms. In my twenties and thirties supported Greenham women by cooking and delivering food and support to the camp at Greenham common. Yes I was and still am a CND member No guys I was not into free love and gang bangs. I was very much a one guy gal . Had several boyfriends before I met my true love at the age of 18  Hey  I did meet him through a music paper , small adds I was a shy chick  wanting to meet guys for gigs and friendship . We met and went to a Bahai meeting. he was a bit of a hippy too, long hair ,coloured satin loons, tie dyed t-shirt. I finished college at the age of 19 and went to Bradford to where he had started uni. We lived together in a shared house a bit of a commune. (far enough away from Mummy and daddy.  I had a different postal address for them as I lived with another group of friends in a flat just round the corner at least that what I told mum and dad for about 18 months (I was [protecting them from the truth) )  we all shared most things cooked ate together best friends some  of those friends are still friends in frequent contact although miles away. Music was a big part of our lives listening to records. going to gigs boyfriend the uni social sec booking bands. He booked Beefheart, and Steve Hillage  amongst many others. We went to music festivals.I like things psychedelic (mind expanding or consciousness expanding. ) Liked underground, alternate music,  progressive rock. Listened to Yes, Pink Floyd, Gentle Giant, Stray , Free , Captain Beefheart and more. As I matured also like other music folk and classical music as well as pop and rock.We walked the Yorkshire moors. Towns were not my kind of thing. We were, I  am still not very into commercialism, not wanting or needing to buy the latest. I was /am pretty laid back man, relaxed, quite cool. Not much gets me annoyed. I was not really out of sight but quite groovy . Wow I was not really far way out, I was quite a wild flower child. I wanted/want Peace and love for all. 20) DixieChick10 had to ask me a movie question what s your favourite movie?  Is there a film, that you ve watched in your lifetime, that still remains iconic to you and maybe even changed your outlook on life and if so why did it change your outlook?.A) I am not a movie buff rarely go to the cinema. I do occasionally watch a film on the TV but rarely one that is really outstanding. I do not think any have changed my outlook on life. I have a poor memory and find it hard to recall many films. I do not really have a favourite , not one I would want to watch again. OK so I saw Mary Poppins as a child and the sound of music seen Clockwork Orange as a teenager in the 70   s That was a strong film. Seen the  Lord of the rings  films at the cinema more recently and was impressed by them. Sorry this is a wishy washy so-so answer but I so rarely watch a movie.21) Coee asks if someone made a movie about your life, what they would call it. Who would you want to play you?A} didn   t someone already do Mary Poppins?  (After seeing this when it first came out when I was 9 or ten Dad always called me Mary Poppins) I was always playing with and looking after children in my home village. Yes, wanted to become a nanny at one stage and meet a rich man fall in love marry have kids and live happily ever after Actually that question quite difficult, what part of my life to portray? My idyllic childhood. My naughty rebellious teenage years. The tragedies of my life the death of my baby  my car accident, The anxieties of having a  teenage daughter with chronic fatigue syndrome  The death of my parents . My mature fairly comfortable life, my career working with children with disabilieties. My love of wildlife and gardening.Maybe it should be a 3 or 4 part movie. First childhood .A happy traditional village childhood in the late 50   s and 60   s. Living in a thatched cottage, scenes of me climbing trees , fording brooks, Playing with my animals  goat, rabbit, guinea pig, mice, chickens Helping my parents  in the garden . Strawberry picking. Then escaping from the village growing up, going to college, hitch hiking all over the country, attending rock festivals and live rock gigs. Becoming a bit of a hippy with long hair, long skirts and smelling of patchouli.  Putting an add in a rock music paper to meet a boyfriend meeting him falling in love, living together with out telling my parents all this in the 70   s. Our amazing country village wedding reception on the lawn of my parents thatched cottage... Our honeymoon, hitch hiking around France with no money. The birth and death of my  baby 18 months after our marriage , The birth of my second child one year later and  the traumatic car accident we had .Friend driving , my hubby and daughter slightly injured, I in a comma for 3 days would I survive ?  Would I be brain damaged   I survived but it took a long time to come out of the trauma. Still slightly affected by the injuries. . .My life since then fairly ordinary working in special needs school enjoying my wildlife garden using no pesticides   gardening to attract butterflies and creepy crawlies. Spending time with my grandchildren and family. I still go to rock music gigs and festivals when I can .   The theme of wildlife flowers and animals, my love of music, my love and work with children My husband  daughter and grandchildren , family all feature strongly in my life .Not sure about the end of the story but I don   t want to be portrayed as a dotty, pathetic old lady. Let me go out with a bang before I lose my marbles . Maybe a heart attack in my organic wildlife garden on a sunny summers or autumn day with birds singing and butterflies everywhere.  Who to play me well that   s difficult. I am not really a great movie watcher or celebrity fan, you probably would need 3 people to play me the child, the teenager and the adult. My hubby suggests maybe character Elizabeth Violet from just William as a child but I think more like Judy garland in the wizard of Oz . Teenager, having difficulty here there   s no one quite like me . As an adult well maybe Meryl Streep or hubby suggests Helen  Mirram The title simply the life and loves of Mary B.

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Twin Slide Tunnel Climber::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.05.2009::::    This little tikes twin slide tunnel climber is fab for an  early years setting or for home if you have 2 or more children under 6 years old...This outdoor or large hall indoor play toy measuring 152cm L   x   160cm W   x   142cm H is a colourful plastic construction.  Basically it is a yellow tower with steps to a platform which has a double red slide on it. This slide has molded ridged edges so your child shoots down the slide not over the edge. This red slide is divided into two by a molded ridge down the centre.  One of the slide   s is wavy ,  the other smooth The width of these slides will only fit a small bum comfortably  a ten year old would find it a bit small and mum and dad certainly would .. As well as sliding fun there is a green plastic tunnel in one of the sides of this toy so your child can tunnel under the slide platform. There are other openings under the slide to crawl through too. This is a good toy will give lots of fun in the garden for a few of years. It will last a long time, the colour may fade but that   s all. Best to store it in the garage in the winter maybe.This toy is good for getting your child active, practicing their climbing and crawling. It will give your child confidence at their abilities and it is a fairly safe toy as it is not very high and the slide top is well guarded by plastic walls your child unlikely to fall from it. Your young child will need supervision on this toy. Do put on a soft surface not on concrete, just in case.  This toy is fairly easy to clean but not a good idea to site under a tree or birds will drop their messes on it that   s not good hygiene for your child also difficult to clean properly. Have fun playing with your children and their toys, I know  I do.This toy cost    249.00 from http://www.littletikes.co.uk     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::6145850:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6758309:3:::6715156:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5722403:4:::5722403:4:::6769280:4:::6769280:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5719918:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6378505:4:::6410840:4:::5690767:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6723034:4:::6665290:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6739162:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio T Switch Rail Track 3363::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.05.2009::::    We need to construct the track before we go on our Brio train journey. A simple circle may suffice for a beginning but it gets a bit boring just going round and round so add some straight track and a T switch A t switch will enable your train to  change direction or reverse down that siding . You could of course go straight on. The T switch pack includes the t switch and a short piece of straight rail too the track Length is 216 mm The t switch is a piece of this wooden track it looks more like a Y really as apart from the straight track that carries on  the other two track lines are curved one to leave the straight track one to join it.. Brio wooden train pieces fir together with male and female joining parts.This piece of track will add lots more interest to the basic track and the make believe travel scenarios are endless. It is a good simple way of changing the direction and train routes across the living room or bedroom floor. My grandsons train s is set up in his bedroom as it got impossible to walk across the sitting room floor. This track is suitable for a 3 year old upwards. At the age of 6 my grandson rarely gets his train set out now but when it does come out he plays happily with it for quite a time. The T track section costs    7.99 from http://www.edirectory.co.uk/pf/880/mia/d/brio+t+switch+wooden+toy/pid/31840655 The http://www.thelittlehencompany.com who are selling this for    9.99 tell us Brio will soon be no longer making this bit of track. You might think that   s a lot of money just for these 2 pieces of track but Brio wooden track is a classic toy very well made will last in good condition for many, many years. Brio train track and the trains are really good. They are attractive and very well made will last generations.  . Ideal for nursery where they will get a lot of use and abuse. Brio track is made of good quality beech wood. There are many shapes of track available straight curved different junctions. There are a large variety of trains and carriages to ruin on a track classic trains steam trains and also Thomas trains too then modern design trains too. Brio trains and carriages are joined together with a magnetic coupling. If I was thinking of buying a train track I would certainly but some curves and a couple of these t sections. However I do not need to cos my grandson has all the Brio train track I shall ever need and I am sure he will save it for my great grand children      ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5285637:4:::5489454:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6748939:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5624457:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6738963:4:::6738963:4:::6410840:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6750576:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6647517:4:::6396178:4:::6396178:4:::6474927:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6769280:4:::6769280:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Trains 3774 Bridge::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::15.05.2009::::    I was playing Duplo trains the other day and we constructed the red Duplo Bridge. Although recommended for a 2 year old a 2 year old will need some assistance building it.  Duplo suggest this is suitable for a child up to 5 I think they are right. Probably a 6 or even 7 year old might play with this bridge and the train set. There are 26 pieces in the box for the bridge The Bridge when constructed measures 42 inches long 10 inches tall.There are brick supports for the bridge to raise it above other tracks, a road or a pretend river. There is track for the approach slopes to the bridge. And red rail guards so that your duplo train does not fall of the bridge. Everything you need to construct a sturdy bridge is here. All you need is some Duplo trains none are included in the set.I am not sure if this bridge is still available as I can not find it in an on line shop. I think it will retail for about    15.This bridge makes a good addition to that duplo train set, compatible with the Thomas set or the standard set of duplo .   I really like Lego Duplo let is a hardwearing conjoining brick. The bricks are fairly easy to put together the colours bright and attractive. Educationally Duplo bricks are good. They encourage fine motor skills and imaginary play. Can be used for colour recognition and basic maths counting. Good for language development too.  Remember to play with your child some of the time as they will benefit from this, use the names for colour count the bricks use words like high and low.So would I recommend this Duplo Bridge? Yes     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::6145850:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6239669:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6603737:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6442533:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6723034:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5719974:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6617478:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::5714912:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6410840:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Barcel� Hammamet, Hammamet::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::05.05.2009::::    Earlier this year we went on Holiday to Hammamet Tunisia. Usually we camp or self cater. I had just come out of hospital and we needed a break so we looked on line and booked last minute the hotel Barcel   . This hotel has recently changed hands used to be the Miramar. We flew into Monastir it took about 45 minutes by coach to get to our hotel. Tunis is about an hour or so the opposite direction.This hotel is on the sea front 5k from the town centre of Hammamet. Although we hired a car as we wished to see more of Tunis off the beaten track it would be a good hotel to stay in with out your own transport. There is a tourist train /bus that runs from  Hammamet town  by the Medina to Yasmine  Hammamet . The train stops in front of the Baqrcelo. Then of course there are trips that your tour operator will undoubtedly offer too . If you wished though there would be no need to venture out of the hotel and grounds and the sea front immediately in front of the hotel. First impression~~~~~~~My first impression on walking into the reception area was good a spacious clean area. Some of the staff had a little English. Some none but we managed. . There was the downstairs checking in desk and attached to that were the bar and a small banking room where we could change traveller   s cheques or UK notes. There were lockers that you could rent so you could put your valuables in. Thee reception area was well organised.There is a variety of rooms available Wii fii is available in the reception and in the junior suitesDouble~~~~~~The double room which we had I shall talk about this in more detail later  Appartment.____ The apartments have 2 bedrooms separate shower and bath. a kitchenette and mini bar. They have a satellite television telephone a hairdryer, air conditioning. They have either a balcony or a terrace.A junior suite.There are decorated in Tunisian style have the bedroom and attached lounge. Separate bath and shower a terrace or balcony, and mini bar, satellite TV, and telephone. Air conditioning. Suite~~~~ This again decorated in Tunisian style. These have 2 bedrooms and a lounge diner. Three bathrooms   With two Jacuzzi type showers, hairdryer, telephone, mini bar, air-conditioning, kitchenette and satellite TV. Again they have either terrace or balconyVilla~~~~THESE rooms are separate from the main building with a private swimming pool. They have two bedrooms, lounge diner a complete kitchen, two bathrooms, hairdryer, telephone, satellite TV, mini bar and air-conditioning So there is an assortment of accommodation   we had the doubleOur accommodation, Double ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. This room was on the first floor some doubles were on the ground floor. We accessed our room by stairs next to the reception.  Opening the door there was a short corridor t one side the separate toilet there was toilet roll installed and a spare one too. Next to that the bathroom. The bathroom has a washstand and a bath with an integral shower. The shower was fine quite good pressure.  The bathroom was clean not elaborate but more than adequate. We were left towels and some shampoo and soap. . The opposite side of the corridor as a fitted wardrobe and shelving unit very spacious. The bedroom was quite large, fairly spacious with a large double bed the bead head was a wrought iron very attractive. On further inspection the bed was 2 single beds pushed together. In the bedroom were a couple of chairs a couple of bedside tables a mirror on the wall and a dressing table fitted unit underneath it.   The d   cor was ok, the walls plain   The balcony was big enough for two to sit with space there was a rail on one end wall I used this to dry my towel in the sun. Overall the rooms were good. Perhaps they will need redecorating for next year but they were fine. The room quite comfortable. After we had unpacked we walked around the hotel getting our bearings.Restaurants and bars~~~~~~~~~As we were so early season not all the bars and restaurants were open. There are 3 bars 3 restaurants. We had a drink in the small bar next to the reception attached to this there was a small caf    /restaurant although we had only booked half board we bought our 1st lunch there it was pleasant... The hotel Barcel    is not one huge hotel it is made of several buildings. To get to the main restaurant where we ate our evening meal we went outside past the swimming pool down some steps there was awning over most of the path so i9f it rained we would not get wet...   The restaurant quite a big building was self service. Wine was served at the table by waiters.  We found the staff very helpful and pleasant... There was entertainment in the bar areas most evenings.  Amongst other entertainment was singing and Snake charming (I was not impressed with the snake charmer) Food. ~~~~We booked half board as we knew we would not be around the hotel for lunch time. I think B B half board, full board and self catering is available self catering in the Villa s. we found the food very good although was not sure what to expect of Tunisian food we did expect it to be a bit spicier than that we were offered  however maybe Tunisian food is not very spicy .Breakfast   .serves 7am -10am ~~~~~~~~There were cereals, and hot dishes (some I was surprised to be offered for breakfast.), eggs either scrambled fried or boiled. Bread rolls, or toast and butter, jams.  Tea, coffee or juice. There were other items available I can not remember them all.Evening meal served 7pm -9pm~~~~~Note we found that bottled water cost a lot in here much cheaper in outside shops, but officially you are not allowed to take drink bought off premises into the hotel Starters~~~~~~A fairly wide range of starters were offered including soup starter. There were about 4 or 5 choices of main meal to help you too Fish a couple of nights different meats, pizza, or Tunisian casserole type dishes a vegetarian option was always available. There was always the option of salad. Accompaniments chips rice. We helped ourselves tom portions as big or small as we wished and we did on occasion go back for more. There was plenty of food available. Deserts well hubby and I always make the joke from Monty python its flan, flan or flan    . No that   s not fair we could choose some sort of cake desert but we usually chose fruit. The meals were good. The Barcel    proudly states it serves its gourmet food.  Not sure about gourmet but I enjoyed mine. After 10 days though we were beginning to get served the same menus again and we thought maybe not enough variety in tastes. That might have been because we were early season and the hotel not full booked. The dining room was certainly no where near fullSwimming pools and sport facilities~~~~~~~~~~~~,There are 2 swimming pools in this complex one outdoor one indoor a part of a water park this pool is heated.  If you wished you could book a massage and Thalassotherapy {seawater health treatment.}  There was a fully equipped gym by the swimming pool. There are tennis courts and mini golf too. Walking around the complex it was well laid out, low rise buildings. A few grassy areas. With trees and flowers. We did not use these sporting facilities as we were not in the hotel in the day time we were out exploring Tunisia.Beach~~~~~ The beach is a lovely clean sandy beach there is a bar/caf    on the beach just outside the hotel. Not opened when we were there in Feb. I think loungers and chairs available there. The beach is a long wide sandy one. The beach is reached by a gate the gate is locked at night. I really quite spoilt staying in this hotel.  Although we did not stay in the hotel and make the best use of its facilities in the day. The facilities were very good and if you wanted you would not need to step a foot out of the hotel complex during your stay (except to get onto the beach)Cost~~~~ ~ We booked last minute and I mean very last minute 2 days before we went it cost us    250 per person half board for a week. Including flights .to see prices for the time you want to holiday there are several web sites offering places one is http:-expedia.co.uk I enjoyed our stay at the Barcel    felt we got a good deal.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Stem Ginger Crinkle Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::20::::very helpful::::12.05.2009::::    Tesco stem ginger crinkle biscuits.These biscuits don   t deliver the taste they promise  - or at least they don   t if you sensitive to coconut flavour  Despite no mention in the biscuit   s name of any flavour but ginger, there is a very strong flavour of coconut. The ingredient list shows that desiccated coconut is the fourth most common ingredient (by percentage mass), stem ginger is the eighth commonest at a mere 4 .Another odd thing is the fact that despite listing coconut as an ingredient the packing claims,    No Nuts   .  I have less trouble understanding the claim that it is suitable for vegetarians; or the warnings about milk, wheat and gluten.To the biscuit eating experience: The rectangular biscuit looks to have come from the mould that is used for shortbread or slightly too fat Nice biscuits. They are golden coloured and look very attractive. The surface is ridged as though a tiny comb had been dragged across it. Biting into the biscuit it has a satisfying snap. Not too brittle but not soft. It doesn   t break into lots of crumbs and breaks cleanly in the mouth. The first flavours are the roasted wheat and the vegetable oils, sugars and coconut following immediately, with the ginger kicking in slightly later and persisting. I liked the way that every biscuit seemed to contain differing amounts of ginger. Presumably (and the way it feels in your mouth), the stem ginger is added as relatively large chunks. So some biscuits might only get a single piece of stem ginger and others four pieces. This makes each biscuit a separate voyage of discovery Depending on your view about how good it is to have a packet of biscuits that won   t let you put them down after you ate the first one; these are arguably very good. Even though I would not choose to eat coconut biscuits, I found myself eating five very quickly. The amounts of fat, salt and sugar were perfect for my taste and the ginger satisfyingly hot in about 1 in three biscuits. This meant when I ate a relatively mild biscuit I felt that I should have another, to get the strong ginger    hit    of those with the larger ginger content.You have been warned - if you don   t want to be overdoing the biscuit eating, then don   t open the packet on your own.If you like coconut flavour and you like ginger I would suggest that you try these biscuits. I won   t buy them again because the coconut flavour countered the joy of the stem ginger and spoilt my enjoyment so badly that the last two biscuits in the pack went soft before I ate them.     ::::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6145850:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::5624457:3:::6609678:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5633146:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6741192:4:::6741192:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5719974:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::5719918:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::6506577:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6739162:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6410840:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6603737:4:::6647517:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::21963:4:::6754091:4:::6754091:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6772623:4:::6772623:4:::6750576:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Camellia::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::10.05.2009::::    I n March I sat typing by my French widows looking out at the garden in the sunshine. My eyes fell on a pretty pink Camellia. This Camellia is one that my Dad grew in a pot. I have it now to add some spring splendour to my garden. This has now stopped flowering .The camellia is an evergreen shrub the serrated leaves a dark glossy green, Depending on variety the camellia will grow between 2 and 20m tall Again depending on variety the camellia flowers from October through to April. The flowers come in several colours from Reds through pinks to white. My pretty pink one has been flowering about a month now. Camellias flowers have between 5 and 9 petals and the showy flowers can be from 1 to 9 cm in diameter. Mine is about 6 cm. My camelia looks very much like the one pictured here. My camellia is doing well in a pot but will grow in a border, I think I will transplant mine into a border, will be easier to keep moist in the summer .I read it is best to grow in a little shade ..... I have just read though camellias do not like chalk soil mine is very chalky so maybe I will revise moving it. I shall prune mine when the flowers drop off, new flowers will grow on shoots that grow in the spring. I hope I manage to keep this camellia of my dads alive for a few years as my parents loved their garden and plants. Camelias can be quite expensive On line I have seen them between    12 and    50. Camellias are not a native plant of England; I believe they originate from china, not sure when they were introduced here.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Red Dragon::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.05.2009::::    My grandson has the Playmobil castle and the Playmobil pirate boat (yes I know he is spoilt) overhearing him talking to a friend we find out he wants the Playmobil dragon. I looked around on the internet and found the price at John Lewis was as good as anywhere else it cost    14,50p and I trust John Lewis and it was free delivery too. My Grandson is 6 this toy suitable for over 4 year olds. The Dragon arrived 4 days after we ordered it and I could not resist playing with it for a moment or two. The dragon we have is a red dragon a green dragon is available too. This dragon looks fearsome he is 11 inches long 6 inches tall with scales and pointy bits along his back .( not sure of correct name for these .) The dragon has a fully moveable head arms and legs so he can walk about and frighten people. His jaws move too and he breathes fire. This dragon must have been caught before as he wars chains around his legs. With this dragon comes a noble journeyman who has a cape crown and sword. The dragon is about 4 times the size of the man. The man can actually sit on the dragons back and your child can fly them across the sky. This set will go well with both my grandson s pirate boat and the castle; however hard you try children will play at things fighting. We have also bought him the play Mobil dragon troops for Christmas, So plenty of play opportunity here. There are other dragon related items in the playmobil toys see http://www.playmobil.de/on/demandware.store / Playmobil toys are excellent. They may be a little expensive but worth it for both the imaginary play a child gets from them and the fact that they are so well made. These playmobil toys last well ideal for groups of children or the individual child. They should outlast one or two children s time playing with them and be fit to pass on or sell on eBay even, or maybe we will save them for my great grandchildren. So would I recommend this playmobil dragon? Yes I would      ::::5646482:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6145850:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::21963:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::5341620:4:::5714912:4:::5577439:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6686844:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6401477:4:::6310942:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5719918:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6603737:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6410840:4:::6771495:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Floor Puzzles - Big Fire Engine::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::06.05.2009::::    The big red fire engine is getting ready for action. But it   s in 20 pieces all over the table you might need to construct the fire engine on the floor. This fire engine puzzle by Orchard toys measures 52 by 42 cm best if it   s done on a hard surface.Are you going to help me make this puzzle? Look at all these bright red pieces. Pieces with feet on, pieces with a traffic cone, this piece has some ladder rungs and here is a smiley fireman face with a hat on his head.  Now I usually start a puzzle with a corner piece or the straight edges, umm the edges of this puzzle are all curvy shaped to go around the fire engine? Let   s start here this looks like the fireman   s hose and there   s another piece that will fit into it, there   s the ladder that will fit in there. We go fitting pieces together and talking about the fire engine as we do, look the fire engines red, these yellow stripes these will fit with that yellow strip on that peace by your toes. Look here is the blue light. How many firemen are there? 5 well ok ones a fire lady. One piece left a piece of a ladder, that   s easy fits here in the space on top of the fire engine. Thank you for helping me. We looked at the picture on the lid of the box to help us a little bit but it was quite easy really wasn   t it.  I like the puzzle picture the firemen are getting ready think they are going to put a fire out somewhere. The firemen look friendly.This puzzle was a little difficult when you were 3 years old , you helped me a little but now you are 4 its easier  for you I expect you might still do this when you are 5 and at 6 finding it easy. You are clever at doing puzzles. What   s that? You like fire engines yes and they flash their blue lights. Fire men help us don   t they? you saw a fire engine the other day it was rushing along the road. I think there was a fire. Be careful on firework night don   t let your bonfire get too big or you might need a real fireman.If you have a young child in your care who has experienced a fire this could be a useful therapy puzzle , don   t push it but offered this puzzle they might do it and start talking about their worries fears and experiences.Sorry doing this puzzle with my 3 year old friend developed into a conversation about fire engines.

This lends a girly aspect to the otherwise battling knights and fire breathing dragon.The Playmobil and princess are sold as suitable for 4 year olds my granddaughter only just 3.This Princess with her unicorn can be bought for    2.99 from http://www.playmobildirect.co.uk /product.asp? product=417 brand=1. The majestic white/cream unicorn is really a horse with a twirly silver blue horn mid forehead. The colour matches his eyes. / The unicorn has golden brown mane and tail. His head is moveable will turn.   The dark haired princess with her golden crown can groom the unicorn with a brush she has. Her arms are moveable as is her head. She is dressed in a long purple white and gold dress with her golden shoes peeping out of the bottom. She will move and twist at her waist where her upper and lower body join. The princess is about 7     cm tall, the unicorn 8 or 9 cms tall. I think this is a good addition to the castle as it adds more options to pretend imaginative play rather than just the fighting.I like Playmobil toys they are well designed and well made they enhance pretend play.  Play Mobil is a German company making metal locks in its early days in 1954 they produced the hula hoop. They moved onto producing plastic goods. In the seventies Hans Beck an employee of Geobra Brandst   tter spent three years developing this product and created the play people we know as Playmobil. In 1974 these toys were introduced at the International Nurnberg Toy Fair. Since then the company has expanded and produced many toys. Some have become collector   s pieces.  Playmobil toys are played with and loved by many children. They are well made very durable suitable for play settings with many children. I am sure that the princess and her unicorn will long outlive my granddaughter   s years of play.      ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5285637:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::21963:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6145850:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6239669:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5803721:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6771611:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::6739162:4:::6756522:4:::6756522:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Value Sliced Peaches in Light Syrup::::Food & Drink::::40::::helpful::::01.05.2009::::    Tesco value sliced peaches. Summer days roll on and I bought a couple of tesco value tins of peach slices. These tins cost me 28p for a 410g tin. These peaches   can not be guaranteed to be nut free.  There are 60 cals per 100g. These peaches are in light syrup.Emptying the peaches into a bowl they are in thin peachy coloured syrup quite sweet.  The peaches, some are a good slice others the slice thin, or part of a slice. They are not ideal if you want to use these peach slices for good presentation. The peaches are a fair texture and taste pleasant enough  not really any different to the standard Tesco tinned peaches.If you were just having peaches and cream I would think enough in a can for 3 servings, a mean 4 servings. However I shall probably use miner in a trifle or a sponge peach pudding. I might give the grandchildren peaches and ice cream one weekend     These peaches seem to be quite good for everyday, a cheap tinned fruit for a desert.  They make a quick easy desert.  Yes these do count in the 5 a day recommendations, you would have to eat 7 slices I believe for 1 fruit.These would be a good peach for Uncle Paul to do the eating goldfish joke on the kids. (Please don   t uncle Paul that joke has lost its humour.)Would I recommend ? Yes .     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5719918:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6145850:3:::6745054:3:::6745054:3:::6756522:3:::6756522:3:::6239669:3:::6739319:3:::6739319:3:::6703843:3:::6703843:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::5567145:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::6217853:3:::6217853:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6739162:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6378505:3:::6605930:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6771484:4:::6771484:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6758309:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5837129:4:::6401477:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6457531:4:::6457531:4:::6310942:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6646674:4:::6646674:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It   s rather cute.This toy is like a jack in the box really. It is quite a large toy 12   x8   x8   The plastic cylindrical    box    is covered in a fabric with pictures of frogs on Lilly pads on it. It has a soft texture. The lid on top of the box is a fabric Lily pad with a Lily flower. This has crinkly fabric to feel. When the lid is lifted a soft toy frog will jump out.  The green frog rattles and squeaks when touched. This is a real surprise feely toy. The frog green has a yellow tummyThis toy is suitable for a 9 month baby. Your baby will be surprised when the frog jumps out of the box I do not think this will alarm baby to much as it is a soft attractive toy. Children I know like this frog in a box and giggle when the frog pops out.  When the frog is pushed back into the box their faces show anticipation as they want and expect the action to be repeated.

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Standard Starter Set 7790::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::26.04.2009::::    I believe this large green tub of Duplo bricks is now retired, no longer available, shame as it   s a good tub. But hey never mind there are many other Duplo sets available which are just as good. This Duplo set of bricks comes in a green flat rectangular storage box ideal to push under the bed or store in the cupboard. There are 75 pieces in this tub. There are large blue orange red green bricks also a figure of a child. These duplo bricks will fire your 2 to 6 year old child   s imagination to make houses trees. There are bricks with eyes on to make animal or people faces. Tall towers long lines your child   s imagination is the limit of what your child can make. This set of Lego duplo bricks would cost somewhere between    12 and    14. You may be able to buy it second hand as Lego duplo is long lasting. As I have said in my previous reviews my grandchildren are playing with my daughters 30 year old duplo bricks and they are in good condition.Duplo bricks are safe suitable for a child aged over 1 year old. Duplo bricks are twice the size of standard Lego bricks and the basic bricks will fit together. Duplo bricks are great for children toys are a child   s tools to learning. These bricks will help your child perfect thier motor skills. Your child will also learn their colours talk to your child about the colours of the bricks as they build. Your child can learn to count if you count the bricks with them, well for language development to learn high low, tall short. Ideal for patterning  placing the coloured bricks in a repeated pattern. This box of bricks includes enough to develop your child   s creativity. Shame I can not find it available anywhere. Would I recommend? Yes Lego Duplo bricks are really, really good. Duplo bricks were first introduced in 1969 by the Lego Company Lego bricks themselves were created in the 1930   s. I expect all of us have played with, and trodden on little Lego bricks (painful) .Please put your bricks away children      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5708728:3:::5708728:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5687589:3:::5687589:3:::5624457:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6239064:3:::6239064:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6241582:3:::6241582:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5719918:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5719974:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::6647513:4:::6145850:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::6442533:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6748939:4:::5837129:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6689593:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6410840:4:::6768925:4:::6768925:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5503807:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6759284:4:::6442315:4:::6442315:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6742888:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Golden Alyssum::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::25.04.2009::::    I have grown this plant Alyssum in the past. My dad had a border edged with it. This plant will last for several years flowering and growing  I think the two I have are no longer in the garden must have died . In the past my plants have come from my dad who grew them from seeds.  This plant is a hardy perennial which flowers   the year after the seed is sown. Best time to sow is February march but you can sow this seed later. If I want some of this plant I shall buy it ready as a plant then it should flower this year. Alyssum is available in white and gold. This review is about the gold one. The picture on this category is the mountain gold one from Dobie   s seeds. A pack of these seeds from Dobies with about 150 seeds in it costs    1.30. This is an alpine plant ideal for a rockery it grows to somewhere between 7 and10 cm and 3-4 inches tall. There are other yellow Alyssums that are taller; gold dust grows to 30cm /12 inches tall.Alyssum grows into a pretty yellow cushion dad used to grow it, edging the border alternating the yellow and white one. It likes a well drained soil so my chalk should suit it. Alyssum is a member of the Cruciferae cabbage family, lot prettier than a cabbage. It smells sweeter too. Alyssum will attract insects, some butterflies will come to them to feast on nectar.      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5790028:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6214353:3:::6214353:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::21963:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6145850:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6410840:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5503807:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5714912:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5690767:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6752042:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5719918:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::6689593:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::6239669:4:::6474927:4:::6750576:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

It was published   by Magi press as one of the little tiger press books in June 2005. I bought a copy for my grandchildren from my local charity shop for 50p still in good condition. D avid Roberts studied fashion design and has developed from that to illustrating books He has illustrated over 30 children   s books.  Dirty Bertie is one he both wrote and illustrated. The first book in the Dirtie Bertie series won the Nottingham children   s book award 2004, 5   7 years category.The book    Pooh is that you    is a sequel to that book.  The cover a bright orange has a cheeky boy on it turned away from you but cheekily grinning over his shoulder his bottom pointing at y7ou has two lines drawn to represent the wind coming out.This book is 24cm square and has 27 pages all illustrated most pages have between 6 and 12 words. This book might well get your child sniggering , its about  farting, yes snigger, snigger trumping, poot, boff, parp,  breaking wind, sneaky ones , smelly ones , noisy ones, Bertie makes smells at the dentists, in the art gallery, in the caf    in his sister   s playhouse. Bertie says it   s not fair he isn   t the only one who does it. Bertie s mum does it when she coughs dad does his quietly  Gran well she really lets rip , but blames the cat, Suzy  sounds like a brass band when she trumps and of course the dog  does it too but Bertie admits he does it best . Especially in the bath.The illustrations in the book are fantastic from cheeky Bertie with his big eyes to the disgusted ladies holding their noses in the caf   . And gran s expression as she blames the cat.This book is really quite funny and I think would be enjoyed by many children yes children fart they haven   t learn the niceties of trying to fart in private or discreetly. Grow ups can get embarrassed by it, this book tells children yes we all trump, it is embarrassing. No one likes to own up to a fart in public. The text is good descriptive words up to 6 letters long, I think the only fart words David has omitted are bottom popping. I think that a six /seven year old would enjoy reading this book on their own and laughing at it. Yes I would recommend this book it is quite fun and the illustrations good. Some people might think it a bit rude, but we all do it don   t us.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6609678:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::5279552:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6723034:4:::6756337:4:::6756337:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6657499:4:::6657499:4:::5719918:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::21963:4:::6202957:4:::6202957:4:::5624457:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6748939:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Colgate Dora the Explorer Toothbrush::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::22.04.2009::::    Get your kids brushing their teeth it   s important. My grandkids have toothbrushes at my house so if they are late going home they can clean their teeth before going to sleep in the car going home. Handy for their sleepovers too. My granddaughter has a Dora the explorer Colgate toothbrush in the toothbrush holder here . I bought it from tesco it cost me    1.45p. This toothbrush is suitable for a child aged between 2 and 6. The Dora the explorer toothbrush we have is a pink one it has a picture of a cheeky Dora on the handle. I think if your child a little reluctant to clean their teeth a toothbrush with a character that they like will encourage them. These toothbrushes are specially designed for children with a non slip easy grip cushioned handle. The oval head of the brush is soft does not hurt gums. The bristles are designed to reach all areas of their teeth. It is recommended that you help brush your children   s teeth and do not leave them unsupervised till they are at least 4 years oldThis toothbrush has pink blue and yellow bristles embedded inn the pink plastic head of the brush the neck of the tooth brush pink too but the handle yellow with a pink picture panel of Dora.

       " '5247778::::Purple Sprouting Broccoli::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::22.04.2009::::    Broccoli purple sprouting broccoli.---------------- I don   t know where my head was last year but somehow my garden has no purple sprouting broccoli this spring shame as I really like this vegetable.  (I think possibly we were so busy sorting out my recently Dads affairs)  Purple sprouting broccoli is a brassica a cabbage.  Broccoli grows to about 2 foot tall 60 cm. green cabbage like leaves growing up the stalk then  a  small purple coloured flower bud head  on top and lots of shoots sprouting  from the stem  by the leaves these shoots have purple coloured flower buds too. The shoots grow to about 5 inches 12 cm long. I was tidying up my greenhouse yesterday and found a pack of broccoli seeds so will be sowing these in March. I note the packet of seeds I have cost around    2.00 I bought mine at the garden centre. You can buy seeds from seeds merchants on line or order from catalogues. You can buy broccoli seeds in many places garden centres   and possibly Tesco; I know my local one has a seeds selection.*I shall sow mine in soil in seed trays in my greenhouse. This gives them a good warm start.  You can start broccoli seeds growing direct in the ground outside. I prefer to start mine inside I shall sow mine in   soil in seed trays in my greenhouse. This gives them a good warm start. When my broccoli is about 3 inches tall I shall plant them outside in the garden.* Slugs can be a problem for me eating my young broccoli.   Another pest that might get my purple sprouting broccoli is the white fly. White butterflies also like to lay their eggs on broccoli leaves but Since I like butterflies I do not worry too much about these. * I shall water my plants them when they need it. Purple sprouting broccoli is really quite easy to grow. Purple sprouting broccoli takes a long time to mature it will not be ready to eater till January next year taking about 44 weeks to mature. Calabrese which people often call broccoli is quicker to mature.So hopefully next January I shall be feasting on purple sprouts.  There are several different varieties which mature at different times check your packets for those that suit you best.  If you do not grow your own broccoli is available in supermarkets to buy. * Broccoli   is a good vegetable to eat with a meat meal. It is a vegetable that my grandchildren will eat more attractive than green leaves although the purple flower buds do turn green after cooking. I will sometimes cook the green leaves as well as the purple shoots.  Broccoli is good cooked in a pasta dish there are many pasta and broccoli recipes in the internet a simple one at http://www.waitrose.com/recipe/Pasta_with_Purple_Sprouting_Broccoli.aspx. Broccoli goes well with bacon makes a good soup. There is a recipe at http://www.waitrose.com/recipe/Pasta_with_Purple_Sprouting_Broccoli.aspx. Young broccoli shoots are also good eaten raw * Broccoli is a healthy vegetable to eat; it is packed with vitamin C and is a good source of caretenoids, iron, folic acid, calcium, fiber and vitamin A. There are reports that this vegetable help protect against cancers and diabetes See http://www.allhealthy.com/2009/02/the-health-value-of-food-determined-by-its-color/ for info on health benefits. So go on be healthy eat your purples as well as your greens     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6145850:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::21963:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719918:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5335750:4:::5719974:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::5624457:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6657499:4:::6657499:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::6701923:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6770214:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6750576:4:::6647513:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6410840:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Britains Ifor Williams Livestock Trailer::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::20.04.2009::::    I was rummaging in the toy vehicle box at work the other day and found this Britain   s livestock transporter. I was playing farms and had a Britain tractor out to play with. This Britain   s animal transporter fits all the 1:32 tractor models. So Johnny and I settled down to play with it.This toy is safe for children over 3 years of age; I think I qualify for that... Let   s look at this trailer first. It is a grey die cast vehicle, a detailed copy of a real Ifor Williams Livestock Trailer.     This toy has rear loading ramp and safety rails which can be lowered to load /unload livestock this ramp then closes up into the trailer for transportation. This transporter has twin axles so it will follow the tractor round corners. This transporter just like a real one has the walls made in panels with gaps between so that the animals can breathe and be able to glimpse the outside. This trailer does have a roof on it. At the centre front is the piece to attach the trailer to a tractor a circular attachment which a tractor will hook into.Johnny hooks the trailer to the tractor, practicing those fine motor skills. He them pushed it into the field( wooden board painted green) We load the sheep they are going to market some get carried straight into the trailer others get pushed up the ramp(they are plastic after all) we fit 8 sheep in the trailer  Johnny  folds over the rails and pushes the ramp up and closes it . Then we drive off Johnny pushing across the carpeted area under the chairs I can see Johnny   s driving needs some practice , We stop and unload the sheep into a farm building (a shoebox in a previous life)  Here Johnny sells his sheep to George who has come over to play. Both children are then distracted by snack time. This toy enables children to develop their imagination and play.  You can use it with them to help extend their vocabulary. This toy will make any rural model realistic can be used in a display about farming by model makers. You can buy this toy in a good toy or department store and on line at many shops.  Amazon is advertising these from    10. 69 from jadlamracingmodels upwards to    15.59 at DuncansToyChest both with additional postage.Would I recommend this toy? Yes if you have a tractor or two it can be fitted to. Britain   s model toys are good well made real life models they add that extra dimension to playing farms     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5633146:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::21963:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::5719918:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6145850:4:::5228340:4:::5719974:4:::6725337:4:::6725337:4:::6603737:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6750576:4:::5690767:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6605930:4:::6609678:4:::6506577:4:::5720245:4:::5720245:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6715156:4:::6759284:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6723034:4:::6474927:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hartleys Raspberry Jelly::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.04.2009::::    I have made many flavoured jellies with Hartley   s jelly tablets one is the raspberry flavoured one.  This jelly is delicious in the summer with real raspberries. . Hartley   s raspberry jelly can be bought in most food shops. Tesco sells this jelly for 35p their own jelly is 28p. Usually I would buy the cheaper tesco one but have on occasion had the Hartley   s jelly.Hartley   s make many flavoured jellies and other food products too .Hartley   s were founded in 1871 The Raspberry jelly as you would expect comes in a red card pack. The jelly tablet is wrapped in a see through plastic wrapper.The rectangle of jelly is made up of cubes that need pulling apart from each other. I guess it was made in a mold, The Raspberry jelly is naturally coloured no artificial colours or flavours in this jelly. This jelly smells of raspberries. I pulled one of the cubes off the jelly and put it in my mouth.  I can never, not do that. The taste was very raspberry. To make the jelly pull the jelly cubes apart and put them in a jug or bowl. Put the kettle onto boil and pout just enough and a bit more boiling water (under570ml 1 pint) in to cover the jelly. Now then stir the jelly in the water till it melts, dissolves into the water. Then filled up with cold water to 570ml /1pint. When you add the hot water the raspberry smell is released and really smells lovely. This jelly can be used to make a trifle; you could add raspberries to the jelly or eat them served with the jelly This makes a really good raspberry flavored jelly.  Why not save empty yoghurt pots and make some up to send into school for your child   s lunch cheaper than those little pots of ready made jelly. I could not end with out a jelly rhymeThis raspberry jelly, Is smelly, Tastes like it comes  From the deli That   s not so good spent ages trying to make up an original rhyme  think the rhymes in my other jelly reviews are better than this one .Jelly on a plate , jelly on a plate Wibble wobble wibble wobble jelly on a plate.

       " '5247778::::Lego Creator: Mini Flyers::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::18.04.2009::::     When my grandson visited us he brought some Lego with him. He had the Lego Creator LEGO Mini Flyers LEGO 4918 set with him. This is a Lego kit in a pocket sized plastic container. There are  not very many Lego pieces in this set but enough to make a airplane model and then when he   s built this zoomed it around in the air a few times he can take it to bits and build a different model. This kit contains bricks that will make 3 different models. Not all the bricks are used for each individual model.Inside the container is a sheet of paper with the instructions for building these models. My grandson aged 6 found it fairly easy to follow the instructions. Each model took him nearly     hour to complete. I thought this set rather good the model not too big containing lots of bricks, something a child could complete in     hour. I thought this set ideal for taking visiting or on holiday to keep little hands and minds busy. The little plastic container it was in was ideal for packing in a bag or to put in the side pocket of the car when going out and about. The planers/air vehicles it made looked quite good. This kit costs about    5. From most toy shopshttp://www.toys1.co.uk/lego-creator-lego-mini-flyers-lego-4918-age-6-89-p.asp has it for    4.99. I think it would make a great Christmas/birthday present for a child   s friend. Would I recommend? YES. My grandson is getting a lot of enjoyment out of his. This Lego toy is recommended for over 6 year olds watching my just 6 year old grandson I would say that   s about right.Lego bricks are a great toy.

       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Farmyard Dominoes::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::05.04.2009::::    Looking for something to buy a child who is aged between 3 and 6 years old? Then this game of farmyard dominoes might just do the trick.  This is an Orchard toy available at http://www.orchardtoys.com/advanced_search_result.php?categories_id=21 inc_subcat=1 keywords=dominoes pfrom= pto= x=27 y=13 for    6. I imagine it will be available in a good toy store too.  Inside a card box with pictures of some of the dominoes are 28 dominoes. There are enough dominoes for up to 4 children to play this game. Also included is an instruction sheet. The dominoes are made of a very thick card, they are difficult to bend. The surface can be wiped clean with a damp cloth if necessary.The domino is a flat rectangular shape. Each domino has 2 bright coloured pictures on it, a bright single coloured back ground and a simplified easy to recognize bright picture of a farm yard animal. There are pigs and hens, dogs, cows, cats, sheep, a tractor.  The dominoes have 2 pictures on one side which is divided by a line. There are doubles of all the animals and other dominoes with two different animal pictures on them. A t the beginning of the game decide who goes first and then  the child next to them has the next urn decide if you will play in a clockwise or anti clockwise direction .  To play this we first to put a double picture card in the centre then divide the dominoes up between the players. The first person to go is the person with a picture that matches the one in the centre. Dominoes are laid end to end. Then each in turn lays a domino, matching the animal picture at one end .If they have no matching picture then a go is missed. The winner the first person to have no dominoes left. This game is a good educational game. It will help encourage interpersonal skills, sharing and learning how to work and play with others. Simply it aids the recognition and names of animals. This game helps to develop observational skills, matching the animals. I would recommend this toy. Suitable both for home or early year   s groups. Orchard toys are good manufacturers of children   s toys well made and have plenty of play value.Dominoes are an old game, a flat tile with pips /spots up to 6 on each side of the domino. Originated it is thought in China, at least as early as 1120 AD. The name is thought to have been named after priest   s black and white hoods which are called dominoes.It is supposed the game of dominoes came to England from the Napoleonic Wars, There are several domino games you can play on line a pingu one at http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/pingu/fun/dominoes.shtml.

       " '5247778::::Picnics - David Loftus & Dave Herbert::::Books::::40::::very helpful::::04.04.2009::::    Summer is the picnic season. The word picnic brings back happy childhood memories or me. My parents would occasionally take is on a picnic we would sometimes go to local woods or picnic on the village green, often my birthday teas were picnics. Just recently someone bought me a book picnics by David Herbert photography by David Loftus. This is a cookery book with suggestions for picnics. This book cost    6.99p it is a square paperback with 96 pages.This book is divided into chapters for different kinds of picnics they are:-Lunch on the road, Picnic on a boat. Teatime in the park, a bike ride picnic, a beach barbeque ,children   s picnic, posh picnic, a romantic picnic and a winters picnic. Not only are there several suggestions for different sandwhich/bagette fillings and several cake recipes. There are salad ideas recipes for cold drinks.David has thought about the occasion and given practical ideas for sandwiches  foods.. For example those for the bike ride are more robust ones which travel well. Hard boiled eggs are one suggestion (I often take hard boiled eggs on a long walk as they are easy to carry) David gives a spiced salt recipe to dip the eggs into at the picnic. He also gives a recipe for dates stuffed with peanut butter to take on the bike ride. (I will often take dried fruit but hate pnut butter)  David has a recipe for a bacon cheese and potato pie as a suggestion for lunch on the road; this is a pasty type pie with pastry.  It   s a good idea for a picnic easy to eat and substantial. No packets of crisps for these picnics but there is a recipe for sweet potato crisps and pita bread crisps. There are recipes for banana bread and fruit cake for that picnic in the park (that   s a great thing to do take the kids to the park and take a picnic) For a posh picnic David suggests prosciuto wrapped bread sticks a chicken Caesar salad and a spiced   prawn dip These recipes are clearly written the full page illustration make the food look enticing. My birthday is the 28th August my husbands and my son in laws the beginning of September we usually  have a  family picnic in the woods at the weekend as a joint birthday/ pre school term  party/ I shall be using some ideas from this book I think this book was a good present for me I will dip into it sometimes. I am now looking forward to those long sunny simmer days and lots of picnics.     ::::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6145850:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::6615749:3:::6615749:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5522492:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5633146:4:::21963:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719974:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5719918:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5837129:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6609678:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6738203:4:::6738203:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6739162:4:::6759284:4:::6239059:4:::6605930:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galt Fun Buttons::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.04.2009::::    Galt toys have made these fun buttons for many years. I have seen and played with them in several early years settings. Your children and maybe even you will have played with them.  Galt fun buttons are brightly coloured red, yellow blue or green plastic buttons they come in a pack of 40 including a threading lace.  A fun button is circular. These buttons I guesstimate to be about 3cm in diameter, I have none at home to measure. They are a couple of mm thick. The edges of the fun button are raised and crimped. There are some buttons with 1 hole in the centre, some with 2 some with 3, 4 or 5 holes. This makes the threading options more varied These buttons are a good size for a child to hold the holes are a good size too. These buttons are ideal for practicing learning threading skills. . The buttons can be threaded onto the laces to make long strings of coloured beads. Because of the raised edges these buttons can be stacked in piles. These buttons can be used in maths for counting, for matching and sorting activities, good for colour recognition.  These buttons are quite versatile can be used in many ways. Handy for counters in a game. These Galt threading buttons are suitable for children aged between 2 and 6 years old. So would I recommend? Well yes they are useful also as with most Galt toys well made and long lasting. They wash and clean easily so if you need/want threading buttons these are good ones. I can not see these fun buttons available to buy anywhere online in a UK site. Galt does not say they are discontinued and I can find them on sale in a US site.These fun buttons retail at about    4.00 a pack of 40; at http://www.teachersparadise.com/ they cost  9.50.     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6718554:3:::6718554:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::21963:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6145850:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6750576:4:::5496122:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5690767:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5837129:4:::5719974:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5719918:4:::6739319:4:::6739319:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6603737:4:::6609678:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6759284:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6661465:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " \"5247778::::Sainsbury's Chocolate Caterpillar Cake::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::01.04.2009::::    When it is one of our pupils birthdays their parents usually send in a cake for us to share with the class. A cake we had recently was the Sainsbury s caterpillar cake. This cake came in a card box with a see through area so we could glimpse the cake. When the outside box was opened the caterpillar cake lay on a thin board cake bourd. The cake was a good choice for a child. The caterpillar was a chocolate Swiss roll rolled up with chocolate butter cream. The outside of the cake was also polled in fairly thick chocolate butter cream too. ne end of the cake had   a green face a circle of icing. This had features, eyes   and a red nose made of icing too. His mouth was molded in the green icing. This caterpillar had dark chocolate antennae, his face was cheery. The chocolate roll body was decorated with coloured smartie like sweets and some coloured icing sprinkles. We put the cake on a plate and stuck the appropriate numbers of candles in it sung happy birthday and the child blew his candles out We cut small pieces of cake for the children most of our children eat very little and there was a small piece left for us staff to try. This cake will serve 12. Luckily my class has only 8 very small eaters. I enjoyed my very small piece of cake it was moist and a good chocolate flavour, Very sweet so I only needed a little taster. We could not give this cake to all the children as it is not suitable for those with a dairy intolerance , however we have an alternate treat ready for this student , This cake is not suitable for those with allergies to  milk egg . Wheat or gluten it is unsuitable for those with nut allergies too. Calories? Yes lots of them 430 kcal per 100g works out at about 250kcal per slice.  If there was any left best to keep in an airtight container to keep it fresh and moist.  I think this was a good cake for a child   s birthday party.

       " '5247778::::Mobilo Black Family::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::29.03.2009::::    Let me tell you about the Mobilo family we have at work. This family is a black ethnic family. A mother, a father, a girl and a boy. This family have much fun playing with the children they are plastic heads .and blocks. There are two families that you can buy from Mobilo this ethnic one and a white family too, in fact you can buy them both together for racial harmony. The picture dooyoo has used is of both white and ethnic family in this ethnic set you do not get the white heads as well What you get in this ethnic family set is the 4 heads each head is broken with eyes nose and mouth, a neutral expression. They have dark hair. They come with two single mobilo cube blocks one yellow, one blue. Then there is a double red block. The yellow cube has a bell in it. I guess that could represent the baby of the family. I have not got one at home to measure but I guestimate a single cube about 3 or 4cm square the heads 2 to3 cm tall . In the pictures mum and dad are sat on the red block the children on the single ones. But there is no reason why as the heads are removable. So the girl could sit by mum and dad and the boy go of on their single bricks. Mobilo bricks are fantastic for little fingers ideal for children aged 3 and upwards. I think a younger child would be able to use mobilo bricks piling and sorting but the heads on this set a little small maybe and might just get swallowed stuck in throat . I think a child up to eight would still be happy playing with these, its all dependent on a child s physical and mental development. These bricks are much simpler than Lego easier to put together. I know special needs children find them a lot easier to construct. However this set of ethnic people does not include connectors for bricks so other than the heads which do not need connectors and the bricks there is nothing else in the bag they come in. These people bricks are made of a plastic. They are easy to wash. They are hard wearing will last many play hours. These people bricks can be used with other mobilo bricks can sit on mobilo cars or anything your child imagination builds. I like these people your ethnic child will be able to relater to them and your non ethnic child will use them and accept them as just other people. These bricks will stimulate your Childs imagination and their creativity. They will help them understand the world .Will practice their fine motor skills. I think these ethnic heads are good would be ideal to add to a basic mobilo brick set. So where can you get these from?

Then I clicked on the union jack flag in the right hand corner to take me to the England page. I could have gone to the French, Italian, German, and Dutch, Neverlands or Spanish site.  This page gives the option to go to that competition again and also the recipe of the month. There is an option to look at all the Pyrex range of products glassware, non stick bake ware, ceramic, microwave or stainless steel.   Clicking on a picture of one of these items takes you to a page    that will show you all the products available in that range.  Before your eyes you will see a conveyor belt with three items of Pyrex ware. Under the Pyrex ware there are a left and a right arrow to move the conveyor belt along as you move the conveyor belt it moves very slowly to display the next product. Sometimes it   s difficult to get the arrows to respond and move the conveyor belt. (That might just be me though) Under the product which is in the centre of the conveyor belt there is some written information, size, material it is made from,  You can find answers of commonly asked questions by clicking on the word questions on the left. There are details of use and care of that product. If you write your postcode there is a list of Pyrex stockist in your area. This site does not sell Pyrex ware directly to you. There is an option to get a few recipes here also to get a few craft ideas to do with the children. There is a handy hint section with tips like this Remove any unpleasant odours from your refrigerator by placing half a lemon inside it. You can find out the History of Pyrex any jobs available or get a newsletter sent to your email address. This site was easy to navigate uncomplicated , I think this site quite useful if you want to make a wedding present list, as you can find out what Pyrex is available and its sizes. Pyrex would make an ideal wedding present lasts a long time some of mine was a wedding present lasting 33 years now.     ::::20105:3:::20105:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5522492:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6752508:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6243305:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6742681:4:::6742681:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6603737:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5587751:4:::6448877:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6717301:4:::6717301:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6759687:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5598433:4:::5598433:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5624457:4:::6729631:4:::6738203:4:::6738203:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5663726:4:::5663726:4:::6378505:4:::5719918:4:::5255134:4:::6728731:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6662488:4:::6662488:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6759284:4:::6239059:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Rich Tea Biscuit::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.03.2009::::      200g of Rich tea biscuits from Tesco in a bright blue wrapper cost 38p that   s pretty good.  Not too many calories in a single biscuit there are 36.I bought some of these the other day and ate one or two with a cup of tea. These are not the most exciting biscuit they are plain and boring  round with little pin prick in them  a hard crisp biscuit , don   t leave the biscuit tin lid off or they will go soggy.  One advantage is that they dunk into the tea without disappearing into a mush at the bottom In comparison to other makes of rich tea biscuit these are ok, middling not out of this world but not dire either.  They taste plain slightly buttery. They are not much if any better than the value rich tea biscuit from Tescos. The value cost 25p for 300g..   I shall use these biscuits when the grandchildren come to visit.  They are good biscuits to decorate with icing. A young child can just be given some icing to put on and then given some cake decorations sprinkles, coloured balls. An older child will be able to make faces on them and use writing icing to write their initials on. This makes for a good activity on a cold wet day.  After decorating of course your child can eat the biscuit too. Would I recommend? Well yes, but no more than other   rich tea biscuits and the teco value ones are in my opinion about the same tasting and dunkability,  These biscuits contain Wheat Flour, Sugar, Vegetable Oil, Raising Agents (Ammonium Bicarbonate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Disodium Diphosphate), Barley Malt Extract, Glucose Syrup, Salt, Preservative (Sodium Metabisulphite). Br warned Tesco says although they do not contain nuts they are made in a factory that uses nuts in other products.Would I recommend? Well yes  , but no more than other   rich tea biscuits and the teco value ones are in my opinion about the same tasting and dunkability     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6750040:3:::6145850:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5587751:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6717301:4:::6717301:4:::6728731:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6448877:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6694963:4:::6694963:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6617495:4:::6759284:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5719918:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6756643:4:::6756643:4:::6609678:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6735325:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5816422:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::6750576:4:::6378505:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Peppa Pig Playground::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::24.03.2009::::    My granddaughter aged 3 in February has a new friend its Peppa pig. Cassie loves to watch Peppa on the television and to be read stories about her. For Christmas I bought my granddaughter a peppa pig playground set. I bought this from Woollies (Woolworths) If you wish to buy this set Argos sell it for    9.78. I have seen it in other shops on and off line for about    10 too. The individual play area can be bought separately I believe. Once my granddaughter opened this toy she got straight into playing with it ignoring her other Christmas presents, this toy is marketed as being suitable for a 3 year old.  , I think its suitable for a boy or girl just 3 year old to about a 5 or even 6 year old provided they like Peppa pig. There are several other play sets with Peppa pig available . I choose the playgrounds set as my grandkids love to visit the park 10 minutes away from their house.  This play set is made of plastic. It includes 4 green plastic play areas these can be played with independently or linked together.One of the playground areas is the swings. The green base grass a few brown    muddy    patches on it and a few white daisies. There is a small amount of white fencing standing up on the    grass     .There is a plastic tree with a few green leaves too. On this play area is a blue support for 2 swings. Another playground area is the slide. The slide stands on a green    grass    area which has a couple of daisies on it and a tree too.The blue seesaw stands on another green       Grassy area with daisies and tree this also has a white fence around part of the play  Area.The last play area is the duck pond the pond is on a green    grassy base too has white fence and atrea there are a couple of daisies on the green base here too and a tree    With this set there are some yellow ducks that goon the pond as well as Pepper pig family and friend figures to enjoy the playground. The Peppa pig figures about 2 inches tall. They are a smooth plastic without sharp edges The Peppa pig characters are bright and attractive. My granddaughter enjoys pushing them on the swing and making them go up and down on the seesaw.  I think this toy is quite good but the pieces particularly the trees are a bit fragile I don   t expect this will last as well as fisher price play sets.  This play set will inspire your Childs imaginary play. It will also help them practice their fine motor skills. Will help develop their language. I watched and listened to my granddaughter playing with this and it was enchanting the way she talked to the pigs like we talk to her. Toy and playing are your Childs work the way they learn. Your child will be able to play with this set independently or in a group. Would I recommend? Well yes my granddaughter has already had a lot of fun from hers.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5171853:4:::5171853:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6759956:4:::6759956:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6717301:4:::6717301:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6448877:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6145850:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6603737:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6693128:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6662091:4:::6662091:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5624457:4:::6759687:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6657499:4:::6657499:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::5719918:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6729631:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::6694963:4:::6694963:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::5723893:4:::5723893:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5307595:4:::6378505:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6750576:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " \"5247778::::Peter Storm Women's Activity Zip Off Trouser::::Sports & Outdoors::::30::::very helpful::::21.03.2009::::    Zip off trousers are ideal for traveling for holidays or that walk in the mountains. These trousers are designed so that you can zip the legs of to turn long trousers into shorts.I take these on holiday it means I actually take less clothing as I do not need to take trousers and a pair of shorts, just these zip offs. I have started the day walking wearing these trousers as long trousers and by the time it gets to mid day have zipped the legs of so I can wear them as shorts. The legs I then roll up and put in my rucksack..  These trousers also save me the  possible embaressment of being seen changing from trousers into spare shorts, not many trees to hide behind when changing on the moors and highlands .   These trousers have some handy pockets .2 hip pockets, 2 sides Velcro    fastening pockets, 2 rear zip fastening pockets, and 1 zipped hip security pocket  I think these trousers only come in olive green colour.  Other zips of trousers have a wider range of colour.These trousers wear well they are durable made from 100  polyamide. They have a no spill finish and UV protection. They are easy to wash and dry reasonably quickly. Peter Storm trousers are available at Millets Blacks they cost    34.99. That is quite expensive really . These trousers are good a good fabric, good design. Ideal for those active holidays . The only disadvantage is that if you are sitting for a long time when wearing them the zip can be uncomfortable and dig into your thighs .     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::6661912:3:::6661912:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6145850:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5719918:3:::5722403:3:::5722403:3:::6603737:3:::6750576:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5837129:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6729631:3:::5840413:3:::5840413:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5624457:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::6758535:3:::6727519:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633146:4:::6766791:4:::6766791:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5690767:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::5347743:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5940576:4:::5940576:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6609678:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Pyrex Ceramic Ramekin::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::19.03.2009::::    Ramekin, no not Rapunzel or Rumplestiltskin or Rasputin but Ramekin a Pyrex ramekin I do not own not even 1 of these pyex dishes, but one of my friends does and I was fortunate enough to eat a delightful desert out of my friend   s ramekin when we went for a meal just before Christmas. So what is a Pyrex ramekin? A Pyrex Ramekin is a small desert bowl with fluted straight sides. The diameter is 9.5cm and the depth is 4cm.  Our desert looked very attractive through the see through glass walls. Our dessert had come straight out of the fridge in this Ramekin. It could have  come straight our of the freezer or cooker as the  borosilicate glass that Pyrex is made from can with stand both freezing and temperatures up to 300 c. however we were having a cold dessert. My friends have had their Ramekins for a long time. They had them for a wedding present (I did ask) and they have been married 20 something years now. So these Ramekins like other Pyrex dishes do last a long time. How easy are they to clean well ok will be fine washed in the dishwasher or by hand , but beware baked on food is difficult to move from those fluted edges not impossible just needs elbow grease . The glass does not stain with colours of the precious meal.You can still buy Ramekin look on line I did and they cost    2.49 each in the sale at http://www.cookinstyle.co.uk/default.aspx?act=Uprod_C3_S53_P1174 usually    2.99. I expect you can buy them at other on and off line shops too. Pyrex cooking dishes have been available for a long time. A glass similar to that used in light bulbs is used. I am sure Pyrex products will be made for many more years too. I bet nearly every household in Britain has or knows someone who has a Pyrex product.  Would I recommend these Ramekins?

I have not put this one together, but if it   s like other little tikes equipment it should not be beyond the capabilities of mum and dad to put together.Suitability and positioning~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~These Little Tikes 8 in 1 adjustable playground is really suited for playgroups or nursery maybe a pub garden. It would be good in your garden if you have more than 1 less than 6 year old.  Try not to put this under tree as birds will leave their messages on it.  This playground should really be positioned on grass or specially designed soft flooring.Age~~~~This equipment is suitable for children  over 2 years old I think that by the time a child is 5 or 6 they will be beginning to get a bit big for it. Size ~~~~~444.5cm L   x   114cm W   x   165cm H you really do need quite a big back garden to put this in.Activities~~~~~~This playground has lots of activities for your child; there is a crawl through tunnel. An easy to open door to a small playhouse which has a small window too. Two slide towers linked by a bridge. One long slides one shorter slide. There are steps up to the walled slide platforms. Colour~~~~~ This playground has areas which are red yellow and green. Cleaning~~~~~If this gets soiled it is easyish to clean a brush and soapy water. Good idea if it has been outside uncovered in the winter to give it a clean ready for the spring. Durability~~~~~~~~ This playground should last a long time the colours fading but it is a good strong plastic construction. Benefits.Outdoor and physical play are both important for the development of your child keeping them fit.

This loaf dish comes in a variety of sizes mine is 30cm.I find this dish useful for making many loaf shaped dishes, I use it for tea bread, banana cake, ginger bread, meat loaf and a variety of other dishes too.I find Pyrex dishes good material l as it is non- porous, flavours and smells do not linger after washing. To wash it up either do it manually or use the dish washer. It cleans well. Pyrex dishes last ages and ages still looking in fair condition. If you drop this Pyrex loaf dish it probably will not break it wills if thrown with force against a stone floor, but I have dropped Pyrex several times and it has not broken. This glass dish is made of  borosilicate a very tough strong glass. This dish will not break if heated up to 300 c. Pyrex is ideal as you can cook in it  put it in the fridge or freeze it. . .

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Green Dragon::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::12.03.2009::::    My grandson has the Playmobil castle and the Playmobil pirate boat (yes I know he is spoilt) overhearing him talking to a friend we find out he wants the Playmobil dragon. I looked around on the internet and found the price at John Lewis was as good as anywhere else it cost    14,50p and I trust John Lewis and it was free delivery too.  My Grandson is 6 this toy suitable for over 4 year olds.The Dragon arrived 4 days after we ordered it and I could not resist playing with it for a moment or two. The dragon we have is a red dragon a green dragon is available too. This dragon looks fearsome he is 11 inches long 6 inches tall with scales and pointy bits along his back .( not sure of correct name for these .) The dragon has a fully moveable head arms and legs so he can walk about and frighten people. His jaws move too and he breathes fire. This dragon must have been caught before as he wars chains around his legs. With this dragon comes a noble journeyman who has a cape crown and sword. The dragon is about 4 times the size of the man. The man can actually sit on the dragons back and your child can fly them across the sky. This set will go well with both my grandson   s pirate boat and the castle; however hard you try children will play at things fighting. We have also bought him the play Mobil dragon troops for Christmas, So plenty of play opportunity here. There are other dragon related items in the playmobil toys see http://www.playmobil.de/on/demandware.store/Sites-GB-Site/en_GB/Search-Show?q=dragons q+.x=28 q+.y=6. Playmobil toys are excellent. They may be a little expensive but worth it for both the imaginary play a child gets from them and the fact that they are so well made. These playmobil toys last well ideal for groups of children or the individual child. They should outlast one or two children   s time playing with them and be fit to pass on or sell on eBay even maybe we will save them for my great grandchildren.

       " '5247778:::: John Lewis Geo Matching Board::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::10.03.2009::::    This is a wooden tray puzzle that we have at work from John Lewis it is a matching geo board, it is made from wood from replenishable sources. I am sorry I do not have the measurements to hand. This shape puzzle board will cost you    7.00 at John Lewis This puzzle board is a natural wooden plank quite thick that has 5 shapes cut into it so that the .insets puzzle pieces will fit into them. This is a substantial puzzle will last a long time. A red circle a yellow square, a green triangle orange rectangle, blue oval. These pieces are a good size for little hands to pick up and hold to see, feel the shape. These puzzle pieces have a large natural wooden peg attached so that your child can use this to place the puzzle piece in place. These pegs on puzzles encourage your Childs pincher grip that they need to hold pencils for writing. Suitable for a child aged 1 and over this puzzle is good for a nursery setting or a special needs school. For home yes maybe but your child will soon outgrow it. This puzzle is good for developing fine motor skills, for that pincher grip. It is also a good way to help your child learn to concentrate to sit and do a task. It is quite simple to do so should not take them long. . This puzzle is good as it will help your child recognise shapes and colour. While you do this with your child, name the shapes and they will soon repeat you and learn the names of shapes. I have used these inset pieces on paper to draw round, your child could do this then colour them in. If you are going to buy a shape puzzle this puzzle is a really good simple and sturdy one I would recommend it.      ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5522492:3:::6716869:3:::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::6145850:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6743009:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5335750:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6241665:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6539421:4:::6539421:4:::5837129:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6474927:4:::6755215:4:::6755215:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6609678:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5719918:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Galt Number Puzzles::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::09.03.2009::::    You can buy this set of 10 number puzzles for    4.99 from http://www.childsplaysussex.co.uk/galt-number-puzzles-3353-0.html . It is available for similar prices from other shops too.I think at present these puzzles come in a red box that has a carry handle, ours at work does not have this handle. This set of ten puzzles is suitable for children aged 3 to 5 years old, or those older who have problems with recognising number. These puzzles are made of a thick card and withstands quite a bit of wear, so should last quite a time. Each individual puzzle is a single number and is a three piece rectangular puzzle. The top piece of the puzzle is the numeral the centre piece which is the largest has a picture   that corresponds to the number so for example on number 1 there   s is 1 spaceship, on number 5 there are 5 hats   . The bottom third piece of the puzzle has the written number. These puzzle pieces are linked with male and female parts so your child does need some dexterity to put them together. I have seen other puzzles link with just wavy joining edges which are simpler. However a 3 /4 year old with normal dexteroty should be able to link the puzzle pieces. These puzzles are good another way of practising those numbers.

       " '5247778::::Blackthorn::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::27.02.2009::::    Why am I writing about Blackthorn?  Well if you want to plant a blackthorn hedge once the snow clears will be a good time. Blackthorn bushes are best planted between November and February. Blackthorn Prunus spinosa  is well know as it produces the sloe  A small black purple blue plum like fruit .. This bush is deciduous bush growing to 5 meters tall. Its branches have many sharp thorns.  This bush/small tree looks magnificent in late March and April with its 5 petaled creamy white blossom flowers.  These flowers are about 1.5cm in diameter. The flowers are on the bush just before the leaves come out. Bees will buzz round these flowers gathering nectar for themselves and pollinating the flowers. The fruit will form and can be harvested in October November.I have a blackthorn bush in the hedge at the bottom of my garden. No not to use to make sloe gin, but for the butterflies. The Black and Brown Hairstreaks butterfly will lay its eggs on the leaves. The caterpillars eating the leaves when the eggs hatch. Also some moth caterpillars will eat the leavers too. Blackthorn fruit will get eaten by the birds. The bush also makes a good place for birds to nest.  I think blackthorn is a good bush to grow if you want a thick hedge as it is a native plant and we are growing so many non native plants in our gardens   My dad used to make sloe gin using the sloe after the first frost. The fruit is very bitter before then he said. Look up on the internet for a recipe but it was quite easy to make I remember pricking holes in the washed sloes putting them in a sterile jar and then pouring in the sugar and gin. Dad used to shake it and leave it in the dark cupboard. He would then shake it   every week for a couple of months before he would drink it. The quantities below me took from a recipe book 450g/1lb sloes225g/8oz caster sugar1 litre/1    pint ginThe gin turns a lovely dark red colour .Apparently you can make a drink using vodka instead of gin. Sloes also make a lovely jelly to serve with roast meats recipe at http://www.cottagesmallholder.com looks good.However the blackthorn may not be suitable for your garden as it is very thorny and spiky. As such it is a good defender hedge and makes a good barrier. Blackthorn is usually found in the countryside as hedging. Blackthorn makes a good thick hedge you could use it amongst other hedge bushes or a make a hedge purely of blackthorn. You would need about 3 bushes to a meter of hedge. Blackthorn likes a sunny position and is not too fussy about soil unless it is water logged.. If your garden is suitable do grow this bush . You can prune it to keep its and hieght in control , but do be careful of the thorns wear good gardening gloves. If you get a thorn in your skin be careful it might go septic .        ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6443287:4:::6443287:4:::21963:4:::6750576:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719974:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719918:4:::5414290:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6752365:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6716308:4:::6716308:4:::6145850:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5790340:4:::5790340:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6612341:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This cake dish is round has fluted edges and two handles for easy lifting, This is has1.1 litre capacity and is about the same circumference as a dinner plate. Price between    4 and    5 available in a lot of shops selling cooking /eating equipment and on line at http://www.kitchen-outlet.co.uk/buy/Cake-Dish-11Ltr.asp.So what do I use this dish for? Well all sorts of things, I cook sponge upside down puddings in it. I use it for cheesecakes. I present salads in it. The list of uses is too long to write on here. The only downside is the fluted edges yes they look attractive but sometimes cooked food gets stuck in them. Still fairly easily remedied just needs a bit of elbow grease and a non scratch cleaner and cleans up well I expect most of us or our parents have a Pyrex product. Pyrex products are good, very tough and versatile. This Pyrex cake dish with handles can be used in the oven can take heats of 300C.  Can be micro waved too. You can use it in the freezer. This dish can either be washed in warm soapy water by hand or in the dish washer All Pyrex has a 10 year warranty on it Pyrex is made of borosilicate toughened   heat resistant glass. Pyrex   kitchen ware has been made by Corning Inc   since 1915, before that this firm developed toughened glass for light bulbs in 1879.So would I recommend this dish ?

       " '5247778::::Red Cabbage::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::25.02.2009::::    For a new years dinner I cooked a gammon joint and served a red cabbage dish with it. This was really tasty, complimented the gammon. This made me think I would try and grow some this year from seed. There are several red varieties of cabbage. I shall try to grow a Savoy type. I expect a packet of seeds will cost around    2. I expect to buy at my local garden centre but seeds are available on line too. Red cabbage should be grown the same way as green ones. I will buy a variety which I can sow in March or April. I shall start my seeds growing in some growing compost in a seed tray in my greenhouse. This will give them a good start. I shall sow a few seeds then a few weeks later sow some more so I do not get all my cabbages maturing at the same time. I shall plant them out when the seedlings are well established a couple of inches tall. Cabbages are relatively easy to grow needing little care just water when it is dry. I shall have to wait a while before I pick my red cabbage as cabbage sown in April will not be mature much before September. I shall protect my red cabbage from slugs and snails we get a lot in these chalky hills, this year I am going to buy nematodes for the slugs as I do not want to use slug pellets. Nematodes are a parasitic nematode of slugs They are harmless to children pets and wildlife. birds   hedgehogs can happily eat slugs after using nematodes . I try to garden organically and love butterflies however white butterflies love to lay eggs on cabbage and caterpillars to feast on it. I shall net most of my cabbages to stop the butterflies getting to them I shall perhaps leave a couple of red cabbages unnetted for the caterpillars. Red cabbage grow just like a summer cabbage, sowing in March, April, planting in June and harvest in August, September. Red cabbage will add colour to dishes red coleslaw perhaps or just plain boiled red cabbage. Red cabbage is popular pickled husband loves it. When you cook red cabbage it will lose a lot of color boiling in water will turn the water red but leave the cabbage a blue grey washed out colour . Adding vinegar helps red cabbage retain its red colour. The dish I made with apples kept its red colour 750g shredded red cabbage 350g Bramley apples 50g Butter 250g Onions, finely chopped 1 garlic clove 1 inch piece ginger root 0.5 tsp cinnamon powder 4 tbsp brown sugar, unrefined 4 tbsp white wine vinegar     pint vegetable stock Method . Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the onion, red cabbage and apple and cook gently for 5 minutes. Add the ginger and cinnamon or allspice and the vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15- minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated and the vegetables are tender. I then put the cabbage in a casserole in the oven with the gamon joint for about     hour .

       " '5247778::::Weight Watchers from Heinz Chicken soup::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::25.02.2009::::     I have been taking soup into work with me for my lunch recently  mostly weight watchers variety. I felt not only would they warm me up ready for playground duty but also be a way for me to eat fewer calories. I bought several varieties including the chicken one at Tesco they were on offer, no longer are the price is 54p for a 295g can. I find this size can good as the bigger  cans of soup too big for me but  and not big enough for 2 servings.The sort of red coloured wrapper has a picture of a bowl of chicken soup on it the soup looks like it has a few pieces of chicken floating in it.* Nutritional values are 88 calories, 1     weight watcher points less than 3g fat I do not need to heat these at home and take in a flask as we have a microwave at work. These cans of soup are easy to open they have a ring pull. Cooking instructions on the can they take about 2     minutes in microwave so just enough time while I make a cup of tea. Pouring the soup into a bowl it is a creamy colour a thin cream consistency not very thick. There are a few flakes of chicken meat in it. I think it does not look as if it will fill me up much. The smell yes chicken not very strong.  I sit down and eat this soup the taste is weak its not unpleasant but it?s a thin taste maybe a slight hint of herbs but not much. Sorry Heinz this is a so- so soup. This soup is not filling I am still hungry.  I want to eat crusty bread with this soup or some toast. Luckily I have a yoghurt and banana with me or I would still feel hungry after this soup.It might just be ok to eat if you are not well and can not eat much and do not want a strong flavour  I shall not be buying this soup again it was not satisfying the flavour mild. The chicken soup with noodles is a bit better, a bit more filling.      ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6145850:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6708159:3:::6708159:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5719918:3:::6744076:3:::6744076:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6701923:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5837129:4:::6609678:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6612341:4:::6693128:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5353345:4:::5353345:4:::5719974:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6378505:4:::6739162:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Vanish Prewash Gel::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::23.02.2009::::    I was sitting next to a pupil at work who decided he would colour my trousers with a green  pen. I was not happy.Getting home from world I liberated my tube of vanish prewash gel from the cupboard. This gel was enclosed in a pink and white tube containing 200g.  The business end of the tube has a clear cap on it. Through this you can see some pink plastic bristles these are attached to the tube of gel.I squeezed the tube and some gel oozed onto the bristles and I then scrubbed it onto the mark on my dry trousers. I had another dirty mark on them too so I used this gel on that unidentified mark too. I left my dry trousers   lying around the laundry area for about an hour I then washed them as normal.After drying my trousers I looked and was delighted to find the marks had gone. I have used this gel on several stains it seems to be effective. If you are using it on an item that has loose weave maybe do not scrub the brush into it to much or you will snag the fibers. I have used this on biro and felt tip stains on grass and dirt stains. It seems to be effective on most stains. Sometimes you need a second or even third application and sometimes it will leave just a faint mark but on the whole this is one of the most effective stain removers I have used. Do check your clothes are colour fast before you use this as it might remove the color dye from them I shall go and find my tube again tonight as a dear little soul has marked my trousers with the same pens.When I buy the next tube I expect to pay about    3.00 for it from a supermarket. It is worth the money as I get to wear my trousers again without the embarrassment of dirty marks on them.     ::::5522492:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5217258:3:::5217258:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5646482:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5587751:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6750576:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6647513:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::6239064:4:::6239064:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6739024:4:::6739024:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6171387:4:::6171387:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6600809:4:::5714912:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5719918:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6734063:4:::6612341:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil Prince and Princess::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.02.2009::::    Most little girls and some boys too love to play princesses and princes. To live the royal life in their imagination. Now my grandson has a play mobile castle with knights and battle equipment. He will probably grow out of playing with this so much in a year?s time and my granddaughter might like to take over the castle. She is nearly 3 so is beginning to play with the castle alongside Adrian who is 6. Now I am going to buy her the play Mobil prince and princess, they will go nicely with this castle she can always put the battle items away when playing with the castle in a girly way. This toy suitable for over 3 year olds  up to about 8 years depending on your childs development and maturity .I think the royal children the prince and princess playmobil number 4257 will be ideal. I shall be looking to find the cheapest price I can buy this toy for at soon weekend. The usual price is around    7.99. I shall search a bit further to see if I can buy this set much cheaper.This set includes a plastic prince and princess the princess is ready dressed in her dress top and petticoat. The plastic skirt of the princesses? dress comes separate so that your child can dress her. The underskirt is white with a pink pattern on it the dress is pretty pink with bows real fairy tale. The princess wears a cold crown to denote her royal status. She has blond hair and a smiley faceThe prince now he is wearing his green trousers and purple striped top gold boots and a crown. His royal blue plastic cape comes separately so your child can put it on and off him. These figures have the standard play mobile grasping hands so that they can grasp any of the playmobil tools from other sets  The Playmobil prince and princes are royal children they do not look like grown ups. The Playmobil prince and princess both have movable arms and legs  so can be put in any position . Now this prince and princes come with a fountain for their garden in the centre of the fountain a gold winged statue. That comes separately can be fitted on easily and taken off again. There are also 2 green birds that can be placed in the fountain to get a drink. Also with this set comes an arched trellis covered in greenery and pink flowers roses also a couple of plastic ribbon bows. This will set the scene in the royal garden for the prince and princess to play, or alternately this flowery arched trellis could be used for the Playmobil bride and groom to set their wedding scene. This prince and princess can be used for many imaginary games. Also I am thinking they would make a great cake topper for a Childs castle birthday cake.  I could buy this set for    7.82 at http://www.martells.co.uk/shop/index.php?pid=5562 At http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Princess-Playmobil-Fairy-Tale/dp/B0007YF6WG its  48.00 or    10 on the UK Amazon site ..Would I recommend well yes as I am thinking to buy this for my granddaughter.

I think this dish only comes in one size approximately 23cm x 30cm.  9. Inches by 11.8 inches. This dish is a good size to get several portions of food from. I use this dish for sponge puddings, tomato and onion flans. It is suitable for cooking any flan or pie/tart in, also useful for roasting potatoes and parsnips. This rectangular flan dish has many uses. To serve a flan from this dish best cut flan in rectangles and serve. This Pyrex glass flan dish is quite attractive enough to use as a serving dish it has fluted raised sides the corners not right angles but rounded.  Although Pyrex glass is easy to clean I do find the fluted sided ones harder as if you over cook burn the food it?s harder to get it off, a good soaking usually helps. This Pyrex glass does not stain. The glass that Pyrex is made is good quality. It is heart resistant up to 300C and can be used in a standard cooker or microwave. This rectangular one a bit big and difficult for my microwave though.  Food can be stored in this in the fridge or freezer it is also dishwasher safe. There is a ten year guarantee on Pyrex. I find my Pyrex very durable quite strong not easily chipped or broken.Yes I would recommend this dish to anyone who wants to make any flans or pies. This Pyrex dish is available at http://www.choiceful.com/choiceful-id-2163-Pyrex-Creatif-RectangularShaped-Flan-Dish-23cm-x-30cm.html for    6.13 its RRP is    8.03.

       " '5247778::::Bubble Wand::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.02.2009::::    I bought one of these bubble wands last year for my grandchildren , cant remember where now , but I notice Amazon , http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tobar-Bubble-Wand/dp/B001EP4L1Y have some at    1.87 RP    1.99. Now this is not a small bubble wand and bubble mixture it?s a huge one.   These bubble wands come in 3 colours blue, orange and pink.  This bubble wand and mix comes fixed to an unusual shaped card.  . The handle is a good size for an adult or teenager to hold may be a bit fat for an under 5 with small hands. The wand is attached to this handle. This wand is large. The info at Tobar says measures 37cm. This wand fits into a long thin bubble tube full of colourfull liquid.I remember waving the wand in the air and if you wave it slowly it produces some large bubbles waving slowly is the trick to get the biggest bubbles. It was a bit difficult for my grandson. I think it would be better for a 7, 8 or 9 year old and as I suggested for a teenager. Good for an outdoor party or festival in the summer.  Bubbles are always good colorful and fun. Also young children and babies love to watch bubbles.  These bubbles would be a good f demonstrating tool when talking about air in class, well maybe use these large ones on the playground. Would I recommend these bubbles? Yes the bubble mix was good the bubbles were lovely. You could always refill the tube with a washing up liquid mix to make more bubbles. Have fun blowing bubbles.

The walker?s petticoat tails shortbread round weighs 150 g. There are 6 segments in this circular biscuit. Petticoat tails shortbread is a circular shortbread which has a crimped design around the edge of the circle, then little indentations like it has s been stabbed with a fork all over. Then there are indentations that divide this large circular biscuit into 6 segments sections.  These indentations make breaking the shortbread into triangles easy. The triangles are about the right size for one serving. .  A light sprinkling of sugar over the golden brown biscuit is attractiveThe petticoat tails biscuit is attractive displayed on a plate before it has been broken up.. Walkers make an especially fine shortbread biscuit. The flavor very buttery, it is a delicate crumbly biscuit. Keep it in an airtight container to keep it from going soggy. There are 520kcal in 100g so that makes each segment contain about120 kcal. Shortbread is a traditional biscuit often eaten at Christmas and New Year.Walkers have been making shortbread biscuits in Scotland since 1898 they certainly have got the recipe right. They are still a family firm selling shortbread worldwide. Visit http://www.walkersshortbread.com/index.asp?cat=Home for info also to enter a competition to win some shortbread Now I have often wondered where the name petticoat tails comes from. After some research it is suggested that the name might come from a corruption of the French petites gatelles ( little cakes ). Apparently Mary queen of Scots was partial to a buttery biscuit in the mid 1500?s. The name might come about as the shape of petticoat tails shortbread is not dissimilar to the bell-hoop petticoats of our own ancient Court ladies   Where ever the name comes from this circular shaped biscuit is a good one. Petticoat tails are great eaten with a cup of tea or you can serve them alongside a fruit salad or ice cream in fact they enhance many desserts      ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6326055:3:::6326055:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5646482:3:::6718554:3:::6718554:3:::5719918:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6664861:3:::6664861:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6145850:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6609678:4:::6750576:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5587751:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5816422:4:::6603737:4:::5510910:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5331868:4:::5331868:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6739162:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5837129:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6752365:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::6748939:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Foxglove::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::20.02.2009::::    Tidying up the garden I notice some foxglove plants. These plants are e at the back of my border. The name although in my childhood I thought it meant foxes gloves really  means  folks gloves , fairy folk were said to use the foxglove bell shaped flower as a glove. The Latin name is digitalis the flower a finger like shape. A fox glove flower does fit on a finger well, just the like a thimble. Again as a child I would pit my finger into a fox s glove.I expect a lot of you will have heard of digitalis a drug for heart complaints, yes this drug comes from the foxglove. This means the foxglove is a poisonous plant all parts of the plant are toxic if eaten. So maybe not a good plant for a child friendly garden. However fox gloves are easy to grow from seed, they self set everywhere. If you wish you can buy plants easily on or of line at a garden centre cost a few pounds for the plants about    1or    2 for the seeds.Fox gloves are biennial or perennial plants. They are native to the Mediterranean region but grow well here. The first year of growth they will make a rosette of leaves then the second year the flower spike will grow flower and die some varieties will grow more flower spikes the following years. Foxgloves are a tall flower growing up to 6 foot /1.8 metres tall depending on the variety. Flowers range from purples, pinks, creams, white and yellows. Seed can be sown either in pots or straight in the garden. They self set well from seed falling from the plant in August. The foxglove grows well in most soils, but not an over damp soggy one. If in a windy position a foxglove will need staking. To stop it falling and breaking in the wind. The foxglove needs very little looking after so is great for an easy garden.The foxglove is an elegant plant a real cottage garden plant.The common English foxglove D. Purpurea (Scrophulariaceae) growing to 4 - 5 ft. (120cm- 150cm) is a purple flower  this is the foxglove we see growing wild in the hedgerows and banks during June and July. The fox glove is attractive to bees seeking its nectar.  After the sun today I started dreaming of those spring and warm summer days in my garden full of flowers .     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5646482:4:::5510910:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6661912:4:::6661912:4:::5719918:4:::6145850:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5837129:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5690767:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6734063:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6617478:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6717301:4:::6717301:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

We have a few of these small tubes at my school and I bought one for my grandchildren . This chatter tube is a thin tube 9.5 cm long. Looks like a longer thin smartie tube. It is neon coloured. There is a yellow one a pink one a green on. They all have different coloured stops at the end of the tube. This is a fun tube smooth to hold a good diameter for a child?s hand. When shaken this tube makes a giggling sort of sound. I have used this with special needs children. One child who has severe learning difficulties little movement and understanding loved it when the chatter tube put in her hand to grip. She could not keep this grip so I supported her by covering her hand with mine. I would help her move and shake twist this tube and she would smile when it made that funny giggle sound. The tube a fantastic bright colour is eye catching. When   this girl was show the tube and I moved it from side to side she would eye track it. Occasionally I would shake the tube it would giggle and so would she.Other slightly more able children able to hold it on their own will shale it and turn it to make the sounds themselves. This chatter tube can be used as a musical instrument to accompany music. For these less able students it is a relatively easy instrument to play. I have used a chatter tube before to get a child?s attention and  play with them I would hide the chatter tube behind me , or a screen and move it from side to side to make a sound . . I am trying to encourage a child to move their head to search for the sound when their head turns they are rewarded by seeing the tube and then I make the tube giggle or assist them to make It giggle. For some really disabled students I worked with once we would hold it high so they would have to look up for it put the tube down so they would look down. The tube is bright attractive and gives that funny noise as an incentive.My ?normal? grandchildren received one as stocking filler and enjoyed the funny giggling a bit rude sounds these tubes make. They thought them fun.This tube is a smaller version of the groan tube makes a slightly different sound. You can buy this tube from http://www.tobar.co.uk/rkmain.asp?PAGEID=20670 STK_PROD_CODE=09844 for 75p a box containing 24 can be bought for display. Hawkins bazaar sells it too.

       " \"5247778::::The Wooden Toy Noah's Arc::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.02.2009::::    This wooden Arc is really fantastic children?s toy. It is suitable for children aged 3 or over. The size of this bright wooden arc is L340mm x W155mm x H290mm. The base of the arc is blue with paler blue water waves on the lowest part. The cabin on the top is yellow with an orange red tiled roof. There is a green ramp that can be used to get to the deck. The cabin has 4 circular windows and a curved doorway.  The cabin can be taken of and put on again easily so your child can put animals in, or get them out again.With this Arc are Mr. and Mrs. Noah and 13 pairs of animals.  There are giraffes, elephants, lions, tigers, crocodiles zebras, monkeys, penguins, rabbits, sorry can not remember the others I do not have this toy at home. The animals are flat animal shapes they are magnetic they will either stick to the magnetic strips  made to look like the planks of wood that make the base of the boat, or they can be posted through the slots on the removable roof . So really this boat is a shape sorter with added magnetic features.I think this is a good toy, do play with your children  remembering to call the animals by their name and your child will soon learn the names of animals , Let your child pair the animals up. Your child imagination will take over and he/she will develop their imaginary play looking after the animals feeding them taking the boat/arc on voyages. This arc is also a useful prop for religious studies talking about the story of Noah and his Arc. So would I recommend this toy? Yes it?s a well made good sized toy very attractive and children do like playing with it. So where to buy? I found one at http://www.woodentoysonline.co.uk/acatalog/info_BJ312.html for    19.99 that?s not a bad price for a well made wooden toy.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6145850:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5646482:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5217258:3:::5217258:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5238639:3:::5238639:3:::6718554:3:::6718554:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::6708159:3:::6708159:3:::5719918:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6612341:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5301762:4:::5301762:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6246090:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6609678:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6717301:4:::6717301:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::5837129:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::6748462:4:::6748462:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6588100:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6163519:4:::6163519:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Paper Lampshades::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::16.02.2009::::    Gosh these simple cheap paper light shades take me back a few years.  The love nest (we shared the attic room) I shared with my boyfriend in a student house in the early seventies had the identical shade to the one in this picture. The reason why? Yes it was dirt cheap. The modern equivalent is only    2.99 for a 12, a larger 12 inch    3.49inch ball shade the larger 16 inch    3.99 available at http://www.discount-lighting-store.co.uk/subprod/paper-lamp-shades-0001801.aspx... Similar ones from habitat cost about    4 or    5. Of course you can buy more elaborate paper shades some different shaped ones Argos has a set of three Sphere, cube and prism shaped. For    4.89. Paper Disney character shades can be bought for your children?s rooms for about a fiver each. These light shades are quite good as they are quite neutral will not clash with the d   cor in the room. Our room was purple and orange with pre-Raphaelite and band posters on the wall. Since I am familiar with paper lampshades similar to the one in the picture I shall talk about this type mostly.. Globe paper lampshades are made in a variety of colours. They are a simple design the paper is stretched and held over wire rings they come flat packed and you open them up like a concertina.  Some other designs I think you have to slot the thin metal rods /sticks onto the paper lamp shade. Instructions to do this should be on the lamp shade packs. These light shades will fit onto standard light bulb holder .Check the pack to see what wattage bulb to use I think they are ok with a 60  or 40 w bulb  best to try and use energy saving bulbs where possible . The light shades let quite a lot of light out not like some heavier thicker light shades. I think these paper lampshades an ideal solution to cover a bare bulb cheap and easy. The  children?s designs great for a child?s bedroom for a few years as they will grow out of pooh bear or Disney princess light shads as they get older.

This is a hard backed book 21cm square. This book has 23 pages + stickers; yes this is a sticker book.  This book is one of a series of sticker books. Butterfly suits written by Susan Ring. Illustrated by Bob Cavin and Andy Mastrocinque. Price on my book    3.99, actually I bought it for 30p from local save the children charity shop. Looks new and has all the stickers. This book is suitable for 4 to 8 year olds.  The book starts by introducing Leo, Annie, June and Quincy. They have a Rocket that will take us on our journey. The rocket can hear singing; turn the page to find out who it is. On the next page we are told to look at the red mushroom there is a monarch caterpillar on it. Quincy feeds the caterpillar he is hungry. Over the page there is a truck which stops to pick up the caterpillar. The little Einstein?s looked at the truck then follows it. Sadly the caterpillar falls of the truck but his friends pick him up and take him in their rocket. On their way to the tree of many colours caterpillar gets hungry while caterpillar is eating Annie tells us all about cater[pillars and how they turn into butterflies, This is the middle of the book where there are 2 pages with stickers, about 20 stickers  pictures of the characters flowers bees . Now the rocket gets to the musical tree of many colours. At the colour tree Annie puts caterpillar on the tree where he begins to change first he hangs up on a tree and makes his skin hard and becomes a chrysalis. Then we watch as days pass and eventually a butterfly emerges. The Einstein children talk about butterflies and have a butterfly party in a flowery meadow. Your child can use the stickers in the book finding the correct picture to stick the stickers over or can make their own picture on a piece of paper. The grandchildren when read this were slightly interested.  I thought it quite good as a book to use in the summer after seeing butterflies or caterpillars. . Husband a member of Butterfly conservation was not over keen on the book. I thought it went through the life stages of the butterfly in a way that was approachable by children and would be useful to introduce children to the cycle of egg caterpillar chrysalis, butterfly. I think as I read it, or after I would explain that caterpillars find many different places to hang up and turn into a chrysalis,This Little Einstein?s adventure begins with a hungry caterpillar  Annie explains to the team that Caterpillar needs to go to the Tree of Many Colors in order to get a brand-new outfit. But when their tiny friend misses his ride to the tree, it?s up to Leo, Quincy, Annie, and June to make certain he gets there safe and sound.

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Junior Sunshine Slide::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::11.02.2009::::    A sunshine slide by little tikes is basically the same as the pink one but in sunshine yellow and green instead of girly pink. The slide is yellow the steps greenThese little slides are little tikes and perfect for your little tot aged between 1 and 2 years old. It would I expect be fine for a tot aged 3 but only just. This slide would be great outside this summer or could be used inside in a hall or a large kitchen or sitting room. This slide is ideal for a mums and tots group.There are 3 green steps up to the top of the slide these are spaces well for little legs quite wide good to get a foot on safely. At the top there are handles molded into the side supports so your child can grip these for safety. The slide is 67cm tall so not very tall. but your tot will think they are on top of the world.This slide chute is s only 115cm long. The two long sides of the slide are raised so your child will not slip over the side also he/she will be able to grip them to ease the passage down the slide there is a small soft safety mat included  for a soft landing .I thought this slide rather good for a toddler its suitable for a child aged between 1 and 2 years old. If we get a good summer this would be good for many hours of outside play.This slide is easy to store the slide part folds up nearly flat to the steps. It is easy also to put up again. It is well made, a good strong plastic easy to clean (don t put under a tree of it will get bird messes on will clean but not nice for kids if they get there before you do with the water.)This slide cost    39.99p from http://www.littletikes.co.ukA slide does have benefits helps your child s physical skills develop. Helps them gain confidence. It will also help them learn social skills, turn taking and waiting.Would I recommend this slide? Yes if your tot will be 1 this summer he/she should then get two summers play out of it.     ::::6615749:3:::6615749:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::5646482:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5837391:4:::6603737:4:::5837129:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5587751:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5719918:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6743009:4:::5719974:4:::6609678:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6744076:4:::6744076:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6748462:4:::6748462:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6647517:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6500274:4:::6500274:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6378505:4:::6588100:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Britains Farming Family::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::10.02.2009::::    This farming family 40954  made by Britain s has been around for several years I have played with it in several different play venues.Britain s makes authentically detailed farm equipment models scale 1:32 There are tractors combiners and other vehicles plus animals for the farm. So to tend the animals, drive the vehicles we need some people. The people in this farm family group are about 5cms tall .Recommended for over 3 year olds.This farm family mum, dad, girl and dog are dressed ready to work on the farm. They look a bit old fashioned really. They all stand on a base of brown mud plastic and all wear green wellies (except the dog who is not standing on mud but on his 4 legs.). Farmer dad has brown trousers and jacket and wears a trilby hat. One hand is on his hip he is carrying a stick in the other.Mum sports a hat on her head too. She has mid length brown hair and wears an oatmeal jumper under her green jacket. Mum wears a blue skirt. Under one arm she carries a basket of eggs in the other handThe other figure a younger girl wears no hat she has brown hair cut in a bob, she wears a grey shirt with her sleeves rolled up and blue dungarees. She is obviously finding her grey bag heavy as she is bending sideward as if she is struggling to carry it. The black and white collie dog can run anywhere he likes scampering around the farm herding the sheep or just going for a walk.This farming family will make a good addition to a farm toy set. Good as a toy for a child aged about 6 or 7 upwards I think.  Your child will enjoy playing with these creating a working farm scene. These figures are realistic, good to add to any other Britain s farm toys.  They would make good additions to a farming display window.This farming family will cost    3.99p from AmazonWould I recommend? Yes for an older child or adult modeler   not quite as easy to hold as the play mobile people, but  they are more for  real reproduction model play.. Have fun playing with your children s toys.

       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Spike the Ultimate Dinosaur::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::09.02.2009::::    I saw this toy displayed and demonstrated in my local E L C shop. I was quite impressed with this 27 inch tall Brontosaurus type dinosaur. Across the shop floor walked this green dinosaur its skin textured, it had a yellow underbelly and lots of spines. He really looked quite impressive. The eyes of this dinosaur blinked. He stood up on his hind legs and his spines lit up. His neck swiveled round and he looked at me, the dinosaur turned and walked towards me, this toy can turn left or right. Then the dinosaur roared, he grunted, his neck bent and his head came low his mouth opened, his teeth were gnarled, his head was then raised again. It is possible with practice to make him pick up things in his jaws and throw them. What makes the Dinosaur move? There is a wireless remote control, it requires three AA batteries (not included). A NiMH rechargeable battery is included, but this will need charging for about 4 hours before use. If it s going to be a present charge it to avoid disappointment. The control panel looked quite simple buttons for moving dinosaur in different directions. Before using Dino apparently the legs and tail need snapping into place before use these need doing so the connectors fit to enable him to walk. The instructions are provided with him as is a plastic bone and a couple of  rocks  This toy can be used indoors or outside. The manufacturer recommends this toy for 3 to ten year old children. I am not really sure about the younger ages as I think the dinosaur a little intimidating and would scare a 3 year old , I could see 8 ,9 .10 year olds having some fun with him . The price though is    125. Which although a good looking toy I don t think there is    125? Of play value here. Yes the dinosaur will promote imaginary play and help children learn how to use remote control directions but, I am not really that sure about this toy. If you have a dinosaur mad kid and wish to spend    125 well fair enough http://www.hot-gifts-for-christmas.com/spike-ultr a-dinosaur.html gives good information about this toy do read this before you buy to double check it s suitable for your child. This toy available at http://www.elc.co.uk/toy/spike-ultimate-dinosaur/ or your high street early learning centre shop .

       " \"5247778::::Hartley's Strawberry Jelly::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::08.02.2009::::    Red jelly, strawberry jelly is often a favorite amongst children Hartley s make strawberry jelly tablets so you can make your own. I usually use a cheaper jelly than Hartley s, Hartley s jelly is 34 p for 13g Tescos own 19p for 135g. It is a while since I have had a Harleys Strawberry jelly but mum always seemed to buy Hartley s jellies in preference to others. Hartley s is a good jelly tastes really strawberry like , smells of strawberries and has a good consistency. Strawberry jelly is good used to make a trifle with or just a standard jelly I remember num making rabbit jelly moulds for my childhood teas. This jelly is delicious served with fresh strawberries or with a tin of strawberries added to the jelly. You could make a strawberry jelly fluff too. The Strawberry jelly as you would expect comes in a red pack with pictures of strawberries on it, open and the red coloured jelly is covered in a see through plastic wrapper. The rectangle of jelly is made up of cubes that need pulling apart from each other. I guess it was made in a mold, This jelly does smell of strawberries when you pull one of the cubes off the jelly and smell it, I always pops one cube in my mouth. I can never, not do that. The taste is really strawberry like. I pull the rest of the jelly cubes apart and put them in a Pyrex measuring jug but any jug or bowl will do. I put the kettle onto boil and put just enough and a bit more boiling water (under570ml 1 pint) in to cover the jelly. I then stir the jelly in the water till it melts then fill up with cold water to 570ml /1pint. The strawberry smell from this jelly is really lovely get the juices flowing. Put in fridge to set takes an hour or two This jelly can now be put onto a trifle into a mold, bowl or indivual pots for school lunches. Or make a jelly fluff. This is made by whipping up evaporated milk adding some strawberries and adding cool jelly and whisk again. Quantities 275ml Water [boiling]; 175ml Half Can of Evaporated Milk; 145g tin strawberries As I sat and watched the telly, I tried to make a rhyme with jelly, It was very smelly but did not fall into my welly, This great big bowl of strawberry jelly, Went straight into my belly     ::::5633146:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5646482:3:::5624457:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6612341:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6145850:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5587751:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6727489:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6701923:4:::6682898:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5837129:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::6609678:4:::6312383:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6665290:4:::6588100:4:::6647517:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::6239059:4:::5383852:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5537651:4:::5537651:4:::6200027:4:::6200027:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil England footballer::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::07.02.2009::::    Do you want to be a football hero? Well you can be with this Play mobil football player.  I looked into buying this footballer and the other football playmobil toys for my grandsons Christmas pressent. We purchased the dragon in stead though as grandson after we pumped him for information was keener on more castle items.  I looked at the Playmobil England footballer though and thought he looked good.  Suitable for a child aged 4 and older. I actually though this football player would be ideal for a putting on top of a green iced cake with a football as a birthday cake for a football mad child or adult. This Playmobil footballer is 7 cm} 2.3/4 inches tall. His legs bend at the hip so he can get a good kick. His arms move, his hands grasp. This Play Mobil footballer is wearing England blue and white kit with a red collar. . He can be picked to wear any number as some sticker numbers come with this toy you can stick these onto his football shirt.  This football player can stand in position on the standing support that is also provided, and yes he footballer comes with his own football. A paper goal target sheet also comes with this toy.He has a pleasant expression on his face so willing to play in any position. A bit boring for this footballer on his own though so you could buy more players for his team. Or you could buy the soccer match or the shoot out toy sets too. Football players from other countries are also available from playmobil too.I think this football player would be a good toy for a child with a football interest and would help develop their imagination. This football player can join other playmobil sets too, he could get married to a princess, fight the dragon, sail with the pirates hold swords or push the babies pram. He can just be that extra male at the playmobil party.Playmobil toys are very good well made and last well so he should be able to achieve many goals.The price of this footballer is    2.50 from http://www.spmodels.co.uk .

       " '5247778::::BRIO Stop and Ramp Tracks::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::06.02.2009::::    BRIO Stop and Ramp Tracks can be bought at the toy store http://www.woodentoystore.co.uk/brio.php for only    4.95p you can purchase it from this store via Amazon or direct from the store. Amazon say the RRP Iis    12.71 My 6 year old grandson has quite a lot of brio track including this stop and ramp track; he has had this train set since he was 3. He is not playing with it as much as he was but his little sister plays with it now. Brio train sets are fantastic the wooden trains and tracks well made will last a long time. When my grandchildren have finished playing with them, I expect my daughter will sell them on for a good price, or most likely keep them for the next generation in nearly mint condition although they have been played with for many hours. The brio stop and ramp track just adds a little more interest to the track. In this set there are 2 ramp track sections and 2 stop ends. The straight ramp track section is short ones of about 10cm. the ramp slope only slight. The stop ends fit on to the ramp track and have a block with red and white stop warning sign. One of the ramp track pieces has a female fitting the other ramp track a male fitting. One stop end has a male fitting the other a female fitting. This means the ramp and stop ends can be used at either end of a standard track piece. My grandchildren build track under the bed around the cupboards in their rooms and have sidings which they use these ramp and stop ends on. Fitting track together helps their concentration and their fine motor skills, solving the problems of which pieces to use. Their imagination is inspired and they go on the most amazing journeys with the trains. Brio ramp and stop tracks are made with wood like the other brio train toys. They are well made and I would recommend them for home or child centre use. I know Brio toys are fairly expensive but cost per play hour with these toys for my grandson is so minimal now as they have had so many happy hours playing with the trains and track which includes this toy. I think for    4.95 it really is worth getting it now there is a reduction in price.     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5522492:4:::6145850:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6243305:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6617495:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6647517:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5410816:4:::5410816:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6591439:4:::6591439:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5096415:4:::5096415:4:::6609678:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6739024:4:::6739024:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lindam Easy Fit Wood & Metal Gate::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::04.02.2009::::    I was visiting someone with young toddlers the other day they had a lindam easy fit wood and metal safety gate fitted at the bottom of their stairs. I thought it looked very smart, very stylish. The supports and wall fittings were metal the gate a pine wood matched other pine furniture in their hallway. The safety gate is one that will open not one you fit and then have to remove or climb over to get up and down the stairs. The opening is good and it closes tight to stop baby falling down the stairs, it s also a bit too difficult for baby to open. This gate fixes to the wall with a pressure fitting, it is very easy to fit. You can adjust this to fit the gap a little.  There are two plastic cups to fit onto the wall to prevent the end fittings moving or marking the walls.This gate fits an opening between 74 and 80cm. The height is Height: 77 cm   you can buy separate extensions so that this gate will fit wider openings. You do not need to drill the walls or to use screws to fit this stair gate. This gate meets, complies with British/European standards. A stair gate is really an essential if you have under two s in your house. This one certainly does the job of keeping toddlers from the stairs and it does look quite good. This gate costs    32.29p from http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3753048/c_1/1 7Ccategory_r oot 7CNursery 7C10199769.htm     29.99 in the sale at http://www.babys-mart.co.uk/itemdetl.php/itemprcd/Lindam_Easy_Fit_Wood_Meta l     25.40 at http://www.babycarecentres.co.uk/id3535.html. This gate is useful you can also use it to block any doorway not just the stairs. Remember to use one at the top and bottom of the stairs if you have a baby. Baby finds stairs fascinating will soon want to try to crawl up and down them , so for safety sake do use a safety gate  as I said this ones pretty smart . Seems well made. Stay safe, keep you children safe too .Mary     ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::5633146:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::21963:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5646482:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5624457:3:::6615749:3:::6615749:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6326055:4:::6326055:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6739024:4:::6739024:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6700603:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::6609678:4:::6738203:4:::6738203:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6378497:4:::6378497:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6241665:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

One of the accessories he has is the adventure tunnel.This Brio tunnel is a plastic grey /brown with a few grassy patches and a few flowers  growing on it  this comes fixed to a piece of wooden train track.  The tunnel measures 216 mm 8.5 inches long. Having a tunnel adds excitement to the train journey. When added to more wooden train track the train can go through the tunnel and there are some sounds as the trains pass through. These sounds are activated by magnets you can also make the sounds by pressing a button on the side of the mountain tunnel. This does need 2 AA batteries these are not included when you buy the tunnel... The train sounds there are 4 of them last for about 9 or 10 seconds. This tunnel adds that extra something to the train set and your Childs creative imaginary play. Brio wooden trains are really great my grandson has many happy hours playing with them. I would recommend for a child between 3 and 8 and then for dads too. Brio model trains are both steam (do not really steam just look like steam trains) and non steam more modern models.

This playmobil gardener is male with a  check cap and moustache. He is about 3 inches tall.  The gardener comes dressed in his black trousers and yellow jumper. He has a protective red apron that he can put on also he has gardening gloves to put on too.He is provided with a pair of rose scissors. He can hold this in his playmobil hand and move his arms to prune the rose bush or cut the flowers. The rose bush is a little taller than the gardener and come planted in some brown plastic to look like soil.  There is a large rose bush and 3 v small ones that can be pushed in the soil.  The soil and bushes are edged by blue looks like wooden planks like in a raised garden. The roses can be picked/cut of the bushes they are pink and red. I think this would be a good addition to the playmobil house setting and the garden setting too. I could go in the castle garden.  This rose gardener can be bought for    3.99 from http://www.youngworld.co.uk/acatalog/GARDEN.html Amazon shops are selling for between    1.90 and    1.99. I think this toy suitable for a child aged between 4 and 7 years old.Play Mobil are always a good toy very long lasting, easy to clean.

These biscuits are available and are delicious all year round. Walkers are one of the better makes of shortbread biscuits. Walkers make shortbread a biscuit in many shapes some with ginger some with chocolate added.  Today I am going to describe a pack of shortbread triangles. These are presented in a cream pack with the traditional walkers red tartan on it. Inside the 175g pack are about 14 triangular biscuits. These biscuits are not a true triangle but the short side is rounded   they look like a segment from a traditional circular Scottish shortbread. The biscuits are a light golden brown the  rounded edge look as if a fork has been used to edge them  and  little holes pricked all over the biscuit . There is a light dusting of sugar over the biscuits This is not a thin biscuit but a thick one substantial. The biscuit is quite crumbly. I put that down to the butter that is in the ingredients.

Hartley s was founded in 1871 by Grocer William Pickles Hartley Hartley s make many food products Jams and deserts, including jellies. I bought a packet of lemon jelly before Christmas to make for Christmas tea. I bought my packet at Tesco, just because Tesco is easiest for me to get to most conveniently situated store. This135g pack of tablet jelly costs 35p There are 296 calories in 100g of this jelly (that s before it is made up ) Hartleys jelly has no artificial flavours and the colours are naturalThe lemon jelly as you would expect comes in a  lemon yellow  rectangular pack. open this and the jelly is covered in a  see through plastic wrapper.. The lemon jelly is a lemon yellow colour of course. The rectangle of jelly is made up of cubes these need pulling apart from each other. I guess it was made in a mold,When I tore open the lemon jelly protective colouring I did have a lovely lemon whiff it was fresh and made my taste juices work. I own up. I pulled one of the cubes off the jelly and put it in my mouth. m it was lovely lemony very fresh not sour but not over sweet either.I Continue to pull the jelly cubes apart and I put them in my Pyrex measuring jug any jug or bowl will do. I put the kettle onto boil and put just enough and a bit more boiling water (under570ml 1 pint) in to cover the jelly. I then stirred the jelly in the water till it had melted I then topped up the water in the jug with cold water to 570ml /1pint.. The lemon smell from this jelly  as I made it was gorgeous If I was adding tinned fruit to this jelly I would have added the juice before topping up with cold water to 570ml/1pint. I could have used this jelly for a trifle   but I have a fussy grandchild who likes plain jelly without bits , so I served this with a fresh fruit salad and cream /ice cream for those that wanted it . This jelly good to serve at any party. I usually use tesco own jellies but was tempted to try Hartley s a bit more expensive. The difference well I think Hartley s a bit better. From memory I think the flavour and smell a bit better.Tasting a portion of this jelly it was lovely fresh and lemony a really good fruit flavour. The colour good a light lemon.

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Basic Bricks Medium 5575::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::28.01.2009::::    I just love Lego Duplo bricks. One of the best pre schools, early year s toys there is. If you have read my previous Duplo reviews you will know how much I like Lego Duplo bricks I have played with Duplo bricks for about 38 years in my career working with children. The first Duplo bricks were marketed by Lego in 1969 I began my training in 1970. Duplo bricks come in many different sets today I will be talking about the Duplo Lego Basic Bricks - Medium 5575This Duplo set of bricks is presented in a cardboard box if you have a plastic tub transfer then to it, as the box will break after your toddler has tried to open it a few times. Stick the picture from the box on the tub then you and your child will know what s inside.Inside this starter set of Duplo bricks are 45 bricks. The bricks are standard Duplo bricks including 2 stud/pip, 4 stud/pip bricks 6 stud /pip bricks and the 8 stud/pip bricks. These bricks come in a variety of bright primary colours red, blue, yellow, green. No wheels or strange shaped bricks.This box is an ideal present for a child aged over 1 this Christmas. Duplo bricks are recommended for children aged upwards of 1 1/2 years old so it is a gift the 1 year old will grow into. I personally think that by 1, most children will begin to play with these bricks. They will be appreciated by a 2, 3, 4 year old too. Possibly a 5 year old. Ideal for older special needs children too.Duplo bricks are safe toy they are made of easy to clean plastic, just wash in warm soapy water or if they have been mouthed by other children and get germs on them then wash in a dilute disinfectant. Yes young children will chew and mouth these bricks as young children chew, mouth lots of things at this early age. But there are no sharp edges on these Duplo bricks. Mouthing toys is away of exploring them, what do they taste like are they smooth, soft, hard, lumpy? Your child is learning about their properties. There are no sharp edges on these Duplo bricksThese brightly coloured bricks will stimulate their vision too. Your child discriminating the colours choosing the colour they like best. Talk to your baby while playing with these bricks use the colour names and your child will pick up the colour names easily. Count these bricks as you pile them together or put them in a tub, that s the beginning of maths early counting and names for numbers. So already your child is learning language and maths.Fitting these bricks together may be easy for us adults but baby at1    -2 will find it difficult fitting the studs together. But just piling those up is fun .That classic action all babies finding fun.... Knocking down the tower that mummy or daddy has built, fun yes but baby is learning some science here that things fall down not up.These bricks are good for practicing those fine and gross motor skills soon your child will be able to fit the studs together. . These bricks will fine tune their spatial awareness which sized brick to fit to fill the gap. Moving bricks from one position to another get a pot or two to place the bricks in little children will spend a while just moving bricks from one container to another.You can just use these bricks for sorting exercises. Putting all the same colours together or all the same sizes. These Duplo bricks are good as your child can create their own model no pre designed one. I was sitting with my 6 year old grandson playing with Lego the other day; we had to follow a pattern to make a specific building. Although this is good in its own way, it is good for your child to build using their own imagination which colours or sized bricks next.Soon your child will be able to build walls with these bricks. You can practice some patterning put one red brick then a yellow brick next a blue brick repeat the colour sequencing and your child will have made a pattern , Get your child to copy a pattern of bricks you have made our lives are full of patterns .You can buy sets of Duplo that make cars, you can buy sets with people but this medium basic brick set 5575 is a good starter set. Your child will use this basic set to extend the other sets of duplo he can add extra bricks to that car now.Duplo bricks are twice the size of standard Lego bricks .The basic bricks of both sets will fit together. Duplo is a good durable brick will last many play hours. Some Duplo bricks my 30 year old daughter had when she was 2 are now being played with her children still in fair condition. I somehow doubt that you will actually be able to buy this precise set of duplo bricks as It  seems to be out of stock or unobtainable at all the shops selling Lego that I looked at so I guess its not made any more. If it were I imagine it would retail about    8. Still there are many other basic Duplo brick sets available just not this precise one. Remember have fun playing with your childrens toys , I do .     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5522492:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::21963:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6700603:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5646482:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6723294:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5837129:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::5335750:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5624457:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::5228340:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5495261:4:::5495261:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6609678:4:::6647517:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5790028:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Saffron Crocus::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::27.01.2009::::    Saffron The saffron crocus, Crocus sativus this crocus that flowers in October must not be confused with the autumn crocus Colchicum autumnale, known as autumn crocus, meadow saffron or naked lady. The autumn crocus is poisonous.The saffron crocus is the one where we get the yellow saffron colouring from .This crocus is difficult to grow in England it needs a Mediterranean climate. Saffron was grown around Saffron Walden an Essex town that took its name from saffron. Saffron was grown in the chalk soils around here. Saffron was grown commercially in the 16 C through to the 18th C. I do not think it is grown here now.  I do not think this crocus is often grown in England However I think you can buy this bulb from http://www.gardencentre.co.uk/product.asp?id=3694 costs    1.95 per bulbThe saffron crocus has 6 delicate petals, a light purple flower these have darker stripes on the outside of petals. The saffron crocus flower only lasts a few days before dying and withering away. In the centre of the crocus are a few orange red stigmas   . These are picked and dried to produce a yellow powder It has been estimated that the stigmas (the female sexual organs of the flower.)Of about 4,000 flowers are required for one ounce of saffron powder. It is this powder which is used to colour food and to add a light flavour, the flavour a slightly bitter woody lightly nutty one, The colour it gives is bright yellow saffron rice is perhaps the most common use I know.The saffron crocus used to be used to colour the clothes of rich people. If you use saffron in your rice you will understand how the colour leaks into the water a golden yellow and how magnificent a gown this colour might look. Saffron is very expensive tesco s saffron strands in a jar cost    2.58 (   51.60 per 10g) for 0.5g.  Tesco saffron powder in a little 0.4 g bag cost    2.58 (   6,450.00 per kg     ::::20105:3:::20105:3:::6465383:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::21963:4:::6700603:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5301762:4:::5301762:4:::6647513:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::5719918:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5719974:4:::6701923:4:::6609678:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::6647517:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Dylon Lingerie Whitener::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::26.01.2009::::    Sadly to say some of my white lingerie was a sad grey colour   maybe due to age or washing on the wrong washing machine.I could have gone out and bought some new white undies. Instead I decided to try a pack of Dylon lingerie whitener.  A pack of this costs    1.74 from Tesco.  This pack contains enough for two treatments. There is also a pack available for 1 treatment.  Dylon suggests this is enough to treat 5 to 8 items.The one treatment box that I used contained 2 sachets one an activator, one a whitener.One Saturday morning I decided to turn my grey s white. I put some hot tap water in a plastic bucket (the pack suggests 60c is a good temperature) I then opened the sachets and stirred. (Dylon suggest you use rubber gloves).

       " '5247778::::Pretend & Play Healthy Breakfast::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::25.01.2009::::    At my school we have not only the learning resources shopping basket full of lunch foods, but the shopping basket full of breakfast food too. I guess they were both bought together. This set of breakfast foods comes in a blue plastic basket a bit like a supermarket basket.  This measures 10.75L x 5.25W.  In this basket includes 2 fried eggs, 2 bacon slices, a muffin, pancake, and a bowl of strawberries, a glass of orange juice, and 13 pieces in total. These of course are made of a soft unbreakable non toxic vinyl plastic.This set is rather good the food quite realistic looking and realistically sized too. This set is very strong will last many play hours.  It will most probably get tasted and chewed by your youngsters but apart from the odd tooth mark it is as I said very strong. When it gets dirty just wash in warm soapy water.An excellent toy for imaginary play. Your children can pretend to buy the food at the shop using the basket, or they can pretend to be having breakfast at home or in a caf   . This toy is good for your child s social skills sharing playing with others. It could also be used as a prop for early math s counting, sharing. Also for language development, use the names of the foods.  You can use this as a prop to talk about healthy eating. You could add some of those miniature boxes of cereal to it empty just stuff them with paper they are quite sturdy.This toy costs    13.99p from http://www.kbtoys.comWould I recommend this toy? Yes children love to play tea parties.  The same price from https://www.rapidonline.com                                                                                                                          16.50 from http://www.learningresources.co.uk/ Would I recommend this toy ?

       " '5247778::::Rhododendron::::House & Garden::::20::::very helpful::::23.01.2009::::    Victorian Horticulturalists in the 18 C traveled far lands and brought home with then many plants which they introduced to our country. The Rhododendron was one of these it is native in the western and eastern Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal and Turkey and also occurs east in countries to Asia.As a child I can remember traveling through Woburn Park to visit an aunt and my mother being awed to see these magnificent flowersThe Rhododendron belongs to a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family species and most have showy flower displays.  This genus contains many plants including the azalea. The rhododendron has small shrubs10 -20m cm tall also large trees 50 meters tallThe rhododendron is planted in many Victorian parks and gardens gives a fantastic display in May, June time. Kew gardens have a really good display. There are many other rhododendron displays and walks available to see these magnificent plants, for example see http://www.bowood-house.co.uk/rhododendrons.html. http://www.sauterelle.co.uk/ProspectHouse.htm and http://www.gardens-guide.net/gardenpages/_0381.htm  When I think about Rhododendron I usually mean Rhododendron ponticum this plant is a tall bushy plant it has large leathery lanceolot leaves that are evergreen.  The bush grows quite densely letting no light in to the ground beneath it. This means no understory of other plants.The flowers grow in numerous large clusters on the branches are shades of pinks and purples, these produce many seeds. There is evidence that a chemical is produced by Rhododendron ponticum this inhibits the germination and growth of other plants .The rhododendron is host to the Oak sudden death fungus  this is a problem to American oaks but I do not think it is in England    .. Yet. The leaves of this plant are poisonous to animals so no animals feed on this plant however insects such as bees visit the rhododendron flowers.  But they do not use the leaves as a food plant it will provide cover for birds too.Although magnificent this plant is as a nuisance it is very invasive. This plant can be found in woodlands where it has escaped from parks and country gardens. Rhododendron ponticum can reproduce by seed, or by roots growing on branches that reach the soil. There is very little to kill this plant so looks like it is here to stay. The rhododendron just needs good management to stop it spreading in our countryside. I believe it is only the rhododendron ponticum that is so poisonous and gives so many problems.In summary a beautiful poisonous invasive plant .     ::::6748462:3:::6748462:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5392318:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5302119:3:::5302119:3:::5624457:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5633146:4:::21963:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6700603:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5646482:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6557505:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6732020:4:::6732020:4:::6701923:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6723034:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5335750:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5790028:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6692844:4:::6198375:4:::6198375:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6609678:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Iceland Indian platter::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::22.01.2009::::    About a week before the Christmas hols hubby and I decided to have a mini party as we had not been able to get to the works Christmas going out meals this year.I went into the local Iceland and bought a few party nibbles, one was this 75 piece Indian platter.I opened the packs and found several individual packets I emptied them all putting the spicy onion and tomato dip in a bowl and the mango chutney in another bowl. I put the other items on a baking tray and cooked for 20 minutes from frozen gas mark 6   or 180 CWhen cooked I placed these on serving plates onto my kitchen table. There were 25 vegetable samosas, 25 vegetable pakoras, 25 onion Bhaji. I choose this pack as we had a few vegetarians invited so it was easy to provide some veggie options.  These foods were just nibbles really not very big but good for finger foods. Since they are frozen you could open the pack and only use some of them saving the rest in the freezer for another day. Also if you were having a curry they would go well as side dishes. So how did they taste well I can not remember clearly but I think they were ok I did sample them all but it s a while ago so can not be precise about the flavours the high and low tones. However I remember eating them and thinking they were ok, I was not wowed overwhelmed but neither disgusted or put of eating them. These nibbles tasted fine. They all got eaten anyway and I found no half chewed ones in the flower pots   61514;  I think these are great for the purposes they were designed for :- partiesWould I recommend? , yes for that new years party they are a reasonable price 1 pack costs a fiver when I bought them.     ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::5633146:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5318403:3:::5318403:3:::5764692:3:::5764692:3:::5805660:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5624457:3:::6625623:3:::6625623:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::6745054:4:::6745054:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6700603:4:::5207685:4:::5207685:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6701923:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6662488:4:::6662488:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6609678:4:::6728386:4:::6728386:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Brick Starters 2242::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.01.2009::::    I just love Lego Duplo bricks. One of the best pre schools, early year s toys there is.  I have played with many, many sets of duplo due to the Pre School /early years and special schools I have worked in. The first Duplo bricks were marketed by Lego in 1969 I began my training in 1970. So that s 38 years of playing with Duplo bricks for me. Duplo bricks come in many different sets today I will be talking about the Duplo Lego set 2242 Brick starters.  This box first available 1997This Duplo set of bricks is presented in a cardboard box if you have a plastic tub transfer then to it ass the box will break after your toddler has tried to open it a few times. Stick the picture from the box on the tub then you and your child will know what s inside.Inside this starter set of Duplo bricks are 52 bricks. The bricks are standard duplo bricks including the 4 stud/pip bricks 6 stud /pip bricks and the 8 stud/pip bricks. They come in a variety of bright primary colours red, blue, yellow , green. No wheels or strange shaped bricks. This box is an ideal present for a child aged over 1 this Christmas. Duplo bricks are recommended for children aged upwards of 2 years old so it is a gift the 1 year old will grow into. I personally think that by 1, 1/2 most children will begin to play with these bricks. They will be appreciated by a 3, 4 year old too. Possibly a 5 year old  Duplo bricks are a safe toy made of plastic which is very easy to clean just wash in warm soapy water or if they have been mouthed by sick germ s children wash in a dilute disinfectant. Yes these bricks will get chewed and mouthed as your child is at that stage still while they are playing with duplo bricks, but there are no sharp edges on these duplo bricks. Mouthing toys is away of exploring them what don they taste like are they smooth, soft, hard, lumpy? Your child is learning about their properties. These brightly coloured bricks will stimulate their vision too. Your child discriminating the colours choosing the colour they like best. Talk to your baby while playing with these bricks use the colour names and your child will pick up the colour names easily. Count these bricks as you pile them together or put them in a tub, that s the beginning of maths early counting and names for numbers. So already your child is learning language and maths. Fitting these bricks together may be easy for us adults but baby at 2 will still find it difficult fitting the studs together. But just piling them up are fun and that classic action all babies find fun    . Knocking down the tower that mummy or daddy has built, fun yes but baby is learning some science here that things fall down not up. These bricks are good for practicing those fine and gross motor skills soon your child will be able to fit the studs together. . These bricks will fine tune their spatial awareness which sized brick to fit to fill the gap. Moving bricks from one position to another  get a pot or two to place the bricks in little children will spend a while just moving bricks from one container to another. You can just use these bricks for sorting exercises. Putting all the same colours together or all the same sizes.  These Duplo bricks are good as your child can create their own model no pre designed one. Sitting with my 6 year old gson playing with Lego the other day .We had to follow a pattern to make a specific building good in its own way. It is good to build using your Childs imagination which colours or sized bricks next. Soon your child will be able to build walls with these bricks. You can practice some patterning  put one red brick then a yellow brick nest a blue brick repeat the colour sequencing and your child will have made a pattern , Get your child to copy a pattern of bricks you have made  our lives are full of patterns .You can buy sets of Duplo that make cars, you can buy sets with people but this basic brick set 2242 is a good starter set. Your child will use this basic set to extend the other sets of duplo he can add extra bricks to that car now.Duplo bricks are twice the size of standard Lego bricks and the basic bricks will fit together. Duplo is a good durable brick will last many play hours. Some Dyuplo bricks my 30 year old daughter had when she was 2 are now being played with her children still in fair condition. This set of standard duplo bricks is good it costs      4.99 at http://www.selecttoys.co.uk/legopreschool.asp. It is available for about that price at other stores too.  Would I recommend? Yes     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5719918:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6700603:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5719974:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6452385:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6739162:4:::6668331:4:::6668331:4:::6145850:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6693128:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6609678:4:::6731397:4:::6731397:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5624457:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6715131:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil Dragon Troops::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::16.01.2009::::    Yes my grandson is spoilt; to go with his other playmobil toys we bought him the Dragon troops. The dragons troops are a knight and his horse and 3 foot soldiers. You can tell they are the dragon troops because they all wear the dragon colours red and yellow, the soldiers all wear chain mail and wear helmets. There are 3 shields for them too the shields have  painted on them ,a dragons head breathing fire, There is a pennant , a flag for them to carry too this has the same dragon head emblem o it .. The horse that the dragon knight can sit on has a red blanket (not sure what the proper name for this is.) with the dragon heads on too. There is a yellow saddle on the horse too. 4 Weapons are supplied for these troops  crossbow sword daggers.These troops look fearsome ready for battle to fight against -or for the dragon alongside or against the other knights with all the other playmobil weaponry provided by Santa. The can help defend the castle or try to take it. These troops can defend or kidnap the princess. Your child does not need other Playmobil toys to play with these Dragon troops, but my grandchildren have several other Playmobil toys and these troops compliment them.The Play Mobil figures are good they stand just less than 3 inches tall. Are good and easy for a child s hand to grasp. The arms and legs move and their hands will grasp Playmobil tools well. Playmobil Dragon troops are made out of plastic, easy to wash just use warm soapy water. Play mobil toys are well made will last many play hours. I anticipate that when Adrian has outgrown playing with these they will go in a box in the attic for the next generation or maybe if they need some cash they will sell them. Used Playmobil toys are in good condition usually and will sell for a good price. These toys do have play value. They will help develop my grandson s imagination and pretend play skills too. They are good for him to practice his fine and gross motor skills with although he does not really need help that way. I have also found that because he plays with his Playmobil knights and castle he has become interested in real castles and their history.  Playing with these dragon troops will also help his language learning new words for things the amour and weapon names. I suspect a lot of children received this toy for Christmas as it is sold our at several shops like john Lewis where we bought ours from. The price of this toy is     7.82 http://www.charliesdirect.co.uk/product_pages/product_details.asp?ProductID =20835 or    9.77p at  http://www.toysrus.co.uk/Toys-R-Us Would I recommend ? Yes  . Have fun playing with your children and their toys, I know I do.

       " '5247778::::Little Tikes Junior Slide::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::15.01.2009::::    Weeeeeeeeeeeee down we go there s a clever girl was that fun. What a pretty pink slide you have. (Friends grandchildren we visited earlier in the year.) It s a bit girly, girly pink slide darker pink supports for the  blue steps  but if you have a boy he might prefer the sunshine yellow and green version of this slide ..This slide is not very big; the slide is only 115cm long. The two long sides of the slide are raised so your child will not slip over the side also he/she will be able to grip them to ease the passage down the slide there is a small soft safety mat included good for hard surfaces. There are 3 steps up to the top of the slide these are spaces well for little legs quite wide good to get a foot on safely. At the top there are handles molded into the side supports so your child can grip these for safety. The slide is 67cm tall so not very tall. I thought this slide rather good for a toddler its suitable for a child aged between 1 and 2 years old. If we get a good summer this would be good for many hours of outside play. It is also suitable for indoor play the size not too big for the sitting or dinning room occasionally. This slide is ideal for a mums and tots group. This slide is easy to store the slide part folds up nearly flat to the steps. It is easy also to put up again. It is well made, a good strong plastic easy to clean (don t put under a tree of it will get bird messes on will clean but not nice for kids if they get there before you do with the water.) This slide cost    39.99p from http://www.littletikes.co.uk A slide does have benefits helps your child s physical skills develop. It will also help them learn turn taking and waiting. Would I recommend this slide? Yes if you have room for it   and if your child likes pink.     ::::5522492:3:::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::21963:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6145850:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::5410816:3:::5410816:3:::5646482:3:::6603737:3:::6218348:3:::5624457:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::6163519:3:::6163519:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::6654302:3:::6654302:3:::6378505:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6310942:4:::5633146:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6738203:4:::6738203:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5719974:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6700603:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6452385:4:::6665290:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6662488:4:::6662488:4:::6439681:4:::6439681:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::6714785:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::6378497:4:::6378497:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Hartley's Orange Jelly::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::14.01.2009::::    I used a Hartley s orange jelly to make a trifle, I like orange trifles added some orange segments to it as well as the trifle sponge m custard and cream.Yes I bought this jelly in Tesco s with my other food shopping cost 35p for the 135 tablet of jelly. I notice that my local spar shop sold it too.The Orange jelly as you would expect comes in an orange pack, open and the jelly is covered in a see through plastic wrapper. The Orange jelly is coloured orange naturally no artificial colours or flavours in this jelly. The rectangle of jelly is made up of cubes that need pulling apart from each other. I guess it was made in a mold,When opened the orange jelly smelled pleasantly orange, yes I own up. I pulled one of the cubes off the jelly and put it in my mouth.  I can never not do that. The taste was lovely orangey.I pulled the jelly cubes apart and put them in my Pyrex measuring jug but any jug or bowl will do. I put the kettle onto boil and put just enough and a bit more boiling water (under570ml 1 pint) in to cover the jelly. I then stirred the jelly in the water till it had melted me then put in the oranges and juice then filled up with cold water to 570ml /1pint. The Orange smell from this jelly as I made it was gorgeous. I poured this onto the trifle sponges in a bowl waited till set put the custard on top then some cream and some sprinkles. This made a really good orange flavoured trifle. You can of course just make a plain jelly from it without bits of fruit grandkids hate bits in jelly.  Or make a jelly fluff.  Why not save empty yoghurt pots and make some up to send into school for your child s lunch cheaper than those little pots of ready made jelly.Kelly eats jelly While watching the telly It slides into her wobbly belly Kelly likes jelly out of a welly It s terribly smelly But that s how Kelly likes her jelly  Hartley s founded in 1871 make many food products including jellies )     ::::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5624457:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5719974:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6665290:4:::6145850:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5522492:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5371022:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6521661:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6738203:4:::6738203:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6722066:4:::6722066:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6609678:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6654302:4:::6654302:4:::6700603:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Bigjigs Wooden Cutting Birthday Cake::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::12.01.2009::::    Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you, would you like a piece of cake, yes please did you say. He, hee here is a piece ha, don t eat it, its wooden, fooled you. The birthday cake that I am reviewing is a toy one it is available from http://www.woodentoysonline.co.uk/acatalog/Wooden_Role_Play_Cooking.html costs    11.99p. Maybe that s a lot of money for a toy cake, but this wooden cake is well made and robust would survive many play hours, real or pretends birthdays. Suitable for children aged 3 and over. This  cake  is a rectangle 200mm long, 220 wide and40mm deep. It is pre sliced into 6 equal pieces.The cake  is a sandwich cake with  jam  filling. It is an  iced cake  with decorations on some sprinkles a few strawberries and other coloured round blobs. Looks quite realistic. This cake has 5 candles on it and a happy birthday flag.  Each candle and the flag stuck onto a separate a piece of cake. This cake will do for either girl or boy. There is a wooden knife provided too. This cake would be ideal for a nursery class to enable all children to have a cake to celebrate their birthdays. Maybe have real cake that the mums provide or biscuits to eat for a birthday treat that way the child whose mum forgets can t be bothered does not miss out he/she is the same as everyone else.This cake set out on a plate is easy to cut as its six pieces precut that are fixed together with small pieces of Velcro type fixing. After happy birthday has been sung the pretend candles blown out (they are not really alight dear) the birthday child or teddy can easily cut the cake with the wooden knife and share the pieces with his friends.

       " '5247778::::Britains Friesian Cows::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::01.01.2009::::    The Friesian cow is a very popular breed of cow yielding good milk also good for meat too. It is sometimes bred with a different breed of cow too. The Friesian is a black and white cow.  It s no surprise that Britain s models make some of these cows for that model toy farm .Britain s 1: 32 scale farm models have a pack of 4 of these cows they cost    3.75 from http://www.britainsfarmandcountry.co.uk/shop and are a similar price in toy and model shops both on and off line. They are    4.75 from http://www.toy-choice.co.uk/products/81/These Britain s Friesian cows are really good models. They stand 2 to 3 inches tall lifelike models. These cows are made of a very hard plastic and will last many play hours. There are 4 cows in a pack I have seen packs with 4 standing cows or 3 standing and 1 cow lying down. Each cow is in a slightly different position one head down grazing maybe. One slightly looking to the right one looking to the left. One as I said lying on the floor.  No bulls in this set they all have udders.These toy cows are recommended for over 3 year olds.  I [personally think a three year old would be happier with a play Mobil cow. The Britain s cows for older children and adult model scene makers. These cows make a good addition to any farm toy set and will provide your child with fun moving them from field to field putting them on a trailer.I would recommend these cows for   adding a  real  touch to a model railway scene look good in the fields alongside a Hornby train set. I would recommend them for a  real  countryside display.Britain s have been making toys since the mid 1800 s   and are a very good manufacturer of model toys soldiers, vehicles ,animals all real scale models. Would I recommend these Friesian cows?

Ohh he s a handsome rugged chap with a stubble beard and his eye patch. You can make him swagger around in his black cocked hat with the skull and cross bone emblem on it. He is wearing a red jacket trimmed with gold and white trousers.This captain won t get lost at sea he comes with his own map a compass and a ships log book. He has also brought his own table with him and a candlestick. So he can see to plot his route I guess.This pirate can move his arms and legs his hands like other playmobil people will hold his and other playmobil tools well.My grandson the lucky sausage got this for Christmas. This captain has yet to join the other pirates on his pirate ship after he brandished his sword and looked at the map he was put back in the box so that he does not get lost before he gets to his new home on the pirate ship in Adrian s room.I am sure this toy will get played with as my grandson often plays with his playmobi pirates.I am not sure how much or where this particular [pirate captain was but you can buy him at kiddicare for    3.49. A lot of other stores sell him for that price too.I think this pirate would make an ideal birth day present for any pirate minded child.This captain is made of strong plastic that will not break easily the plastic takes a long time to fade. If after a few years of playing with this toy my grandchild keeps it in storage I will probably see my great grandchildren play with it or maybe my grandson will sell it for a fortune on eBay.Have fun playing with your children s toys I know I know I doPlay Mobil toys are super, suitable for over 4 year old children.

This Playmobil ghost pirate is a good figure adds that extra dimension to pirate play. My grandson aged 6 thoroughly enjoys playing with this and the other pirates that he has.

I poured the soup   into 2 bowls one for me one for hubby. This soup a caramel brown colour had lots of onions in it. It tastes really good one of the best onion soups I have tried.  I have thought about using this soup as a starter for a meal with friends, I might soup it up with a few fresh fried onions. To add a little something extra I might top it with some grated cheese or serve it with cheese on toast croutons This soup is good and it only contains110 calories per tin.

       " '5247778::::Mookie Toys First Order Account Slinky-Original Slinky - Metal- Slinky::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::26.12.2008::::    Ciao now slinkyI remember these sleek, slinky, shiny, metal slinky toys from my childhood in the 1960 s. I recall being fascinated by watching them walk down the stone steps in the playground. This toy can also be juggled from one hand to the other, one coil following another. Playing with Slinky is fun. Put Slinky on the top stair all coiled up  Take the top coil and gently take it over the top of the step to just before half way then let go and the slinky takes over and walks down the step The slinky will walk down all the steps unaided. It is amazing how such a simple toy movement will hold your attention. If you are with a group of friends I bet they will all want a turn. I can remember my school playground with a group of children watching slinky walk down the steps many times.Juggling Slinky was another favorite pastime.  All you need to do to juggle it to hold an end coil of this toy in each hand, then raise and lower each hand alternatively in rhythm. To achieve this certainly gives a sense of achievement.These toys were invented in 1943 by a U.S. Naval engineer. He watched a spring falling on the floor and inspired he developed this toy. The original slinky s are coiled metal springs. They are made from metal 80 ft/ 24.4m long 0.0575 inches/0.146 cm in diameter. Modern Slinky can be found made of plastic. Some have animal heads the common one is the slinky dog. Some Slinky are rainbow colours. The tumbling slinky very attractive. These slinky toys are also used   in education when explaining waves to demonstrate longitudinal and transverse wave motionsYou should be able to buy a slinky for under a fiver.  http://www.duncanstoychest.co.uk/products/2372/original-metal-slinky.html  and http://www.charactersntoons.co.uk/product-1618.html both sell metal ones for    3.99. I am sure you can buy them in toy shops for this price too.

       " '5247778::::Camping Vall de Ribes::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::23.12.2008::::    This year we camped in the Spanish Pyrenees just outside the town of Ribes de Freser .The camp site called  C   MPING VALL DE RIBESThis camp site is about 5 minutes outside the town on the road to Pardines. If you were not traveling by car the train from Toulouse in France which continues on to Barcelona stops at Ribes de Freser. Or there is an airport at Girona or Barcelona about 100 km s away.We traveled by car and arrived at the campsite found the booking in office   We paid 4.75 euros  for the tent each night plus  5 euro per person plus 5 euro for the car. If you want to check prices go to.  http://www.campingvallderibes.com/english/preuseng/preusacampadaeng.htm. As well as camping places for tents and caravans there are some wooden chalet bungalows available. The price peak season 599 euros for 7 nights for 4 people in a chalet they will sleep 6 you pay a little extra for the 5th and 6th person.The is campsite is on a hill overlooking the valley but there are flat terraces for the camping, the tents on two lower terraces. The places for the tents are ample and there are trees spaced between the camping places. We choose to camp in the lee of the mountain so we would be shaded in the morning the camping placings the other side of the track got the sun earlier. We did not need electricity but there are points to hook up to electricity. The camp site is not crowded and noisyThis campsite has good facilities.  No need for a big supermarket on site there are supermarkets 5 mins walk away, but I seem to remember we could buy milk and bread and a few other essentials here. There are adequate showering and washing facilities both on the upper and lower level of the   campsite office building. This had hot water and sockets for hairdryers /shavers -do remember to take a two pin adapter if you are taking an English plug with you.  There is a bar -restaurant facility and this served good food we ate there one night. There was a TV to watch in this area too.At the top of the site there is a small swimming pool, I did not use this but we walked past and noted several people having fun there. This is the third time we have visited this camp site .It is a friendly site and one with magnificent views we woke up each morning to the view across the valley and of the mountains. In the evenings we would eat our meal, drink our wine gaze over the mountain tops and see birds of prey flying in the distance.This camp site is in a fantastic area for walking, cycling and outdoor exploits. The flora and fauna fantastic. If it s raining its only an hour or so away from all the attractions in Barcelona. There are several places within an hour or two to see some Gaudi and Dali work . The villages and countryside are beautiful. This area will call us back again and this campsite good and well positioned, so I anticipate we will stay there again one year     ::::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6700603:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6696245:4:::5719974:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6603737:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5809862:4:::5809862:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6601486:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5837129:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5624457:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Orchard Toys Farm Four in a Box Jigsaw::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::19.12.2008::::    I work in a school and this is one of the puzzle sets we have. When it was harvest time this was a topical puzzle to have out. This is a set of 4 farmyard puzzles from Orchard toys. This puzzle set is presented in a box not a tin.  This is a rectangular box with the pictures of each of the puzzles on it  One puzzle is of a tractor, this has 4 pieces, another puzzle is two cows this has 6 pieces; the next puzzle has 8 pieces its 3 sheep. The last puzzle is 4 hens in a 12 piece puzzle. In the corner of each puzzle there is a number which relates to the number of animals in the picture. The pictures are bright and attractive. The animals look friendly. There are other clues to numbers in the pictures such as 3 rocks in the sheep picture and 4 eggs in the hen picture.These puzzles are each 18cm by 18 cm.  The 4 piece puzzle pieces bigger and easier to hold and position than the smaller pieces in the 12 piece puzzle. This set of puzzles is suitable for children aged over 2 years old. The 2 year old beginning to get an idea about placing and fitting the 4 piece puzzle Unless you have 2 children at home with abilities to do the 2 and 12 piece puzzle maybe this not for you as 1 puzzle might never get used. For my special needs school it is ok as we have a range of abilities. Puzzles are good for children, helps them develop their concentration skills. Good for gross and fine, motor skills. This will help develop eye hand coordination.  Your child will learn to recognize these animals learn their names, make the sounds that these animals make. Your child will also be exposed to number and learn to count. Their language being developed and extended. Do talk to your child about these puzzles as they do them say the animal names and count the animals. Make learning fun.Generally I think these puzzles ok not brilliant but ok. Would I recommend well yes but there are many puzzles as good as or better than these.Thes puzzles are available from http://www.orchardtoys.com/advanced_search_result.php?categories_id=2 inc_s ubcat=1 keywords=farm+ pfrom= pto= x=13 y=18 they cost    6 .

       " '5247778::::Parsnips::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::17.12.2008::::    Are you having roast parsnips with your Sunday roast beef or Christmas turkey?I probably will be. I like parsnips (hubby doesn t so I rarely get them) Parsnips are a root vegetable very much like a carrot but a creamy white colour (taste different of course.). The leaves that are on top of the ground look quite similar. I have on occasions grown parsnips but our chalky soil is not ideal for parsnips or carrots.I usually buy a parsnip from the supermarket at tesco they cost    1.98p a Kg if you buy them loose at Tesco at the mo. cost more in bags or prepared. Try not to choose the largest as often they are more fibrous and woody that the smaller ones. The centre core gets hard and woody as they get older.Parsnips keep well for about a week or so in the fridge. To prepare them for cooking both wash and scrub them well or thinly peel. Chop them into small [pieces if boiling, if roasting you may cut them in half Parsnips are a vegetable that can be cooked in boiling water for about 15 minutes longer if you are cooking big chunks of parsnip. They are good steamed for 15 minutes too.Serve them like this to eat as a vegetable accompaniment.Parsnip are a good veg to use in a hearty stew with meat and some other root veg  some beans too, excellent winter food To accompany a roast dinner I like to roast them alongside my roast potatoes a whole parsnip will taker 30 -45 minutes at 180C. You can make parsnip chips or crisps too. You could of course eat grated raw parsnip in a salad good in a mixed carrot and parsnip salad. There are lots of parsnip recipes at http://www.justvegetablerecipes.com/inxprs.html. Ok so now you have cooked your parsnip what does it taste like? A parsnip is quite a sweet vegetable, quite a distinctive flavour . Parsnips are good for you they contain potassium, the B vitamins and vit C. So an excellent vegetable. If you wish to grow set seeds in February y or March keep watered for a good root and harvest August September don t leave to late or they will go woody seeds are available off and on line at garden centers or seeds merchants see http://www.dobbies.co.uk/acatalog/Parsnip_Seeds.html several different varieties for between    1.00 and    2. Good to grow a few carrots or parsnips to show your child how they are grown the veg under the soil.     ::::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6461332:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5522492:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5293643:4:::5293643:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6696549:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5719974:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5318403:4:::5318403:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6691263:4:::6691263:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6668331:4:::6668331:4:::6700603:4:::5690767:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6603737:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6271081:4:::5837129:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6725762:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::21963:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6647513:4:::3957:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6615749:4:::6615749:4:::6718554:4:::6718554:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6310942:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5624457:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6190414:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5605857:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5587751:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

There is a pennant with the Dragon coat of arms which fits over the cannon. Be warned the cannon although not huge does really shoot it will knock down castle walls or a pile of bricks. The cannon ball will also fire into Nana accidentally on purpose I think, making her go ouch. So although no serious damage can be done best to encourage your children to fire at the plastic knights and not at little sister. . To make the canon work aim and fire by pushing a button.This cannon and the knights certainly gives a lot of fun adding that extra dimension to the castle or pirate play. Your child imagination can be let loose playing with this toy. Attacking or defending the castle or taking the troops out on a crusade.  Finding the dragon and knocking him over with the cannon ball.

       " '5247778:::: Playmobil Ambulance::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::10.12.2008::::    Whoo whooop woo wooooo it is the ambulance coming with its working red flashing lights. It s only pretend. I am playing with the Playmobil ambulance. A lot of children enjoy playing at being the nurse or the doctor. This Playmobil ambulance will give many play hours of pretending to be the ambulance crew or the injured person. This ambulance is suitable for a child aged 4 years and over. The ambulance is quite a good size L35 x W12 x D24cm. Your child will be able to put the play people in and out of the ambulance. I think its good for children to play with real life toys like this helps them prepare for the possibility they might have to go in an ambulance one day , playing with things like this makes them seem safer somehow.  This ambulance is a good vehicle looks just like the real thing... The side and the back doors open. It does have a removable roof so your child can help the ambulance men deal with an emergency should they need it on the way to the hospital. With the ambulance comes a collapsible stretcher with foldable legs and adjustable hear rest. The two ambulance men can get the stretcher out of the ambulance and put their play person patient on it. A Playmobil child comes with the set, so she is the one most likely to need the ambulance. The Playmobil child has probably fallen of her bicycle this bicycle comes with the set too. Also with the ambulance the ambulance crew have a medical case and equipment for administering first aid. A fire extinguisher comes with this set too, just in case a fire breaks out. The ambulance crew can put fires out with it.The ambulance engine needs 2x AAA batteries for the lights to flash, I do not think these are included. This toy is well made; durable should be fine for a nursery / play group or the home.  You can buy this for    24.95 at John Lewis its RRP    27.99. This toy would compliment the Playmobil hospital. Would I recommend this toy?

       " '5247778::::Tomy Bathtime Squirters - Percy::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::07.12.2008::::    Squirting Percy in the bathThe Percy my grandchild squirts in the bath, and students at my work place squirt in the swimming pool are a toy. This toy is a water squirter in the shape of Percy the green engine. This character comes from The Railway Series a set of story books for children about a fictional railway which were written by Rev. W. Awdry. Percy bath time squirter is a   train with Percy s features exactly the same as the drawing in Rev Awdry s books. This green engine is made of a soft rubbery fabric easy to squeeze. The train is about 14cm long. When Percy is submerged in water squeeze him to get all the air out and replace with water Percy will fill up and then when you take him out of the water and squeeze he will squirt water. Although this water squirter is alright I have used others which are better for squirting water.This toy is recommended for children 18 months and over, but mum and dad will have fun squirting Percy at baby long before then. . Children will continue to enjoy using this toy until they are quite old.Water play is great fun and educational too so do not confine Percy to the bath get a  bowl of water for baby /toddler to play with or use Percy in the paddling pool (clothed adults beware yes you will get wet Percy will get pointed and squirted at you  ) This toy is available from http://www.abctoysandgames.co.uk/products/1002233838-Percy-Bath-Time-Squirt er.html for    3.09p or from http://www.thomasthetankshop.com/thomas-the-tank-shop-66-80-bathtime_squirt er_percy-thomas_bath_time.htm for    2.99p.

Well I do own quite a variety of Pyrex dishes some wedding presents 30 + years old , some bought myself and other ones I acquired more recently when my parents died and we cleared the house . Fancy a roast? Well this large Pyrex roaster will do the job. This roaster measures 39 x 25cm s fills an oven shelf of my oven completely. This roasting dish as deep sides 60mm it has at the top of the dish. No lid.I shall be using this roaster to roast our Christmas turkey; I have also used this roaster to roast many joints of meat. I have used it to make a massive toad in the hole. This is not just suitable for meats I have cooked several cakes and pies in it . I have used this dish to make many things it is ideal as it is so big. This Pyrex roaster is made of toughened glass can take heats of 300C. This roaster is good as Pyrex glass does not stain. I can be washed either by hand or in the dishwasher. You could freeze this if you wanted to. But o far I have not found it necessary. You could use this in the microwave, but it s a bit big really. So as you can tell this pyrex roasting dish is very durable pyrex in general will last many years in good condition . Pyrex has a ten year warrenty on it. Price well I note Debenhams have it on sale for    10.40p was    13.00 cheaper at    8.00 at  https://www.the-emporium.co.uk/productdetail.php?productid=116182.

       " '5247778::::Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::24.11.2008::::    When we went to visit friends in Yorkshire  in the summer we stopped of at the Yorkshire sculpture park. We have meant to visit before, but somehow never have. This park was founded 1977 at, West Bretton, Wakefield. Originally a large house on a parkland of some 500 acres This Park is very easy to get to as it is only one mile from junction 38 of the M1.   There was quite a lot of parking which costs    2.00 entrance to the park itself is free.We got there after taking 5 hours to get there from  near Lupton it usually takes about 3, So were tired and in need of a cup of tea so we went into the caf    / restaurant.  The tea was good about the same price you pay anywhere and there was a terrific view over the parkland with the hills as a backdrop .The restaurant was on the first floor and there was an outside balcony you could sit on if you wished. The snacks and meals looked fair but we did not subcombe as we were going to have a curry later,We briefly looked around some of the indoor gallery some photographs by Kwanho Yuh a Korean who lives in Germany.The art and sculptures in the park change from time to time as they are on loan from the artist or museums /art galleriesWe went outside to view the outside exhibits. There were good paths and large grassy areas trees and bushes some of this area is accessible for wheelchair users but not very easy The outdoor exhibits were not crowded together but given their own space.  There are sculptures by Andrew Goldsworthy, James Turrel, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Helen Escopedon and a few more. The sculptures in the park change from time to time as they are on loan from the artist or museums /art galleries.It was interesting to walk around the park and view the sculptures; some said more to me than others. If you are in the area I would recommend a visit. Unfortunately due to traffic and our desire to continue on our journey we did not spend long enough to absorb and see all of the exhibits, we will have to visit another time when we go up north.There are courses and classes run here for adults and children to explore and experience art.

       " '5247778::::Fisher-Price Crocodile Keys::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::23.11.2008::::    No not crocodile tears but crocodile keys; this is a toy from Fisher Price. The crocodile is suitable for children 18 months and over. This is an attractive toy a green crocodile.  , a musical toy this can be played as either a xylophone or a piano. The crocodile looks friendly big eyes and a wide grin This toy is a green plastic crocodile shape measuring 35cm long, 16 cm wide and 9cm tall. It needs 3 AA batteries.  There are 6 large brightly coloured keys on the crocodiles back red, blue yellow, maroon, green, purple. To make music with these keys your child has to hit them with the yellow stick that is attached with a blue string. The stick is stored in the crocodiles mouth, the music your child can make is quite noisy, yes but the sound not too harsh. If your child wants to take croc for a walk then he can pull him along holding the drum stick that is atached to that blue string, the crocodile will bob along nicely behind him. Now to play in piano mode by each key there is a matching coloured button which makes a piano sound when pressed again this is not too harsh a sound.  So what benefits will your child get from this toy? Well your baby will realize that by making an action he will make a sound this is a good cause and reaction toy. Your child will practice his coordination skills, he will also entertain and get the adults attention, also learn to  tell different colours apart tell your child the colours as he hits them so he will soon pick up the colour names. You could use this toy to count with too sing number rhymes or count as your child bashes (sorry plays the keys). Children love music and making sounds. Do praise your child talk to them; you never know you might have a budding musician in the family.This toy is well made and should last a long time.

       " \"5247778::::Tesco's French Set Cherry Yoghurt::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::18.11.2008::::    I decided I wanted a change from the cheap value tesco yoghurts I usually take to school for my lunch so saw the Tesco French set yoghurt these cost 98p for 6 125g pots so these are good value too. The yoghurt that I ate yesterday  was Cherry flavored French set yoghurt. Sat in the staff room away from the noise of the pupils I finished my sandwich then I reached into my lunch bag. I pulled out cherry yoghurt packaged in a plastic pot with an orangey label on it. Writing and a picture of a cherry on the wrapper confirmed that this was cherry yoghurt.I peeled back the foil lid, it smelt lightly of cherries. It was a light red colour , had a small amount of what looked like clear oil on top of it, I guess some ingredients had begun to separate . I dug my soon in the yoghurt was a firm liquid spoonful. I tasted my first mouthfull; it was ok not really very cherry like, the texture, sort of jelly or blamange like. No bits in this yoghurt it is smooth textured one .This yoghurt was ok not special just ok. I think I actually prefer non set yoghurts. Other flavours in the pack of 6 included peach, cherry, and raspberry. Lemon apricot and vanilla. These yoghurts come in 125g plastic pots covered in an orange paper label usual written info on the wrapper plus a picture of the fruit.These yoghurts contain 125kcal per pot, 16.8g sugar, and 4.1g fat.Overall I was not ecstatic about these cherry set yoghurt I have had better they are not super low fat and sugar ones so doubt if I will rush out to buy more when I have finished these , . They are ok but that s all.     ::::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5633146:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5646482:3:::5584168:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5624457:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6234177:3:::6234177:3:::6439681:3:::6439681:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6242691:4:::6288851:4:::6700603:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::21963:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5719918:4:::5620008:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6378505:4:::6609678:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5719974:4:::5306962:4:::5306962:4:::5567145:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio Wooden Railway System: Large Curved Tracks::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::16.11.2008::::    My grandchildren are lucky and have a wooden brio set. My grandson has spent many happy hours playing with it and his little sister likes to join in too.My grandson had a brio starter pack and we have added to it so he could go round more corners we bought him some brio 6.5 inch curved track this came in a 4 piece pack. 8 pieces of this track will make an 18 inch circle.The brio curved rail track is double sided. Grooves for the train to run on either side of the wooden track piece. This means you can lay the track down either side up and the curve will go right or left whichever way you want it too Your child will use his brain working out which way to lay the track how to fit it to the next piece, Brio track joins together with what they call male and female connectors basically one end has a little piece cut out of it the other end has a little knobby piece that fits into it like a jigsaw.Brio trains are really great with these circle tracks your child can make tracks to go on many imaginary journeys, Your Childs imagination will be working over time planning routes going on holiday or to London on the trains and having many crashes , Yes all children love to make the trains crash.The train track my grandson lays is all over his bedroom floor around his desk under the bed, by the wardrobe and back again. This layout certainly needed curved track.Trains run well, smoothly on these tracks. The wood is smooth not rough does not splinter The brio curved track is made of beech wood, very strong it should last many play hours and more.  The brio trains that will fit on this track are superb models of real trains. My hubby a bit of a train anorak at times enjoys playing with our gson and these trains. This train track set cost    4.95 at  http://www.woodentoystore.co.uk/index.php?cPath=26_37. about this price most other stores too.Lots of other wooden train sets are compatible with Brio and usually cheaper than brio too the tesco ones are http://direct.tesco.com/search/default.aspx?search=tesco+wooden+train confi rm.x=49 confirm.y=9 and trains and track found athttp://www.clementinetoys.com/acatalog/Brio_compatible_wooden_trains.ht mlhttp://www.tuliptoys.co.uk/acatalog/Trains__Planes_and_Automobilies.h tmlhttp://www.hotukdeals.com/item/240993/12-pieces-brio-compatible-trac k-onl/ .Brio is an old company first started in 1884 making baskets has progressed to making the first wooden train sets and now makes many toys and pieces of children s equipment To see a full range go to http://www.brio.net/BRIO_NET/UK/startpage Brio train track and the trains are so well made they will be in a good enough condition to pass on to someone else or keep for the next generation.

       " '5247778::::ELC Art Centre - Blue::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::13.11.2008::::    This is one of the art easels in my classroom at school.This Art easel is easy to erect you just need to pull the two sides of the easel apart and it stand up on its 4 legs. If you want to store it away after use then just fold it together again. This easel usually stands fully erected in my classroom though. I work with 3, 4, 5 year olds and it is a good height for them. This art easel ok for 2 to 8 years olds the measurnenys are Height: 106 cm, Width: 55 cm, Depth: 69.5 cmThis is a very sturdy stable easel not easily knocked over. This one has blue plastic legs and a blue plastic frame around the two faces of the easel. One side of the easel has a chalk board on one side a wipe clean white board on the other side. The other side has a wipe clean white board surface. Underneath the easel face is a blue tray for paints, crayons, pensAt the top of each side of the easel just under the blue plastic border are two red clips these are for holding up art paper.Now the chalk board surface is fine, good for chalking on. Rub the chalk of easily with a black board rubber.The white board surface is fine too. Needs a good clean occasionally with a white board lotion.The boards are a good size to take art paper, just put it under the clips and your child can start painting, crayoning their art masterpiece ..... Uhh ohh a little problem, the paper does not stay up easily under these clips unless it is quite thick. Any way as soon as your youngster starts to paint it falls off, opppps so I will get the blue tac or sellotape out to stick the paper onto the easel securely. The blue plastic frame around the easel surfaces is thicker than the easle and too thick to enable you to use a household peg to peg the painting paper in position.Art time finished, paint all over the easel. It s easy to wash off with a damp clothWould I recommend this easel well it s a good height, versatile surfaces, easy to clean, but those bits of paper need sticking on securely. Still you find that with most easelsThis easel is available for    35.00 from http://www.elc.co.uk/toy/art-centre-blue/ or your high street ELC store.This easel is also available in a pink plastic border     ::::6703546:3:::6703546:3:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::6288851:4:::5633146:4:::6242691:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::21963:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5646482:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6452385:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::6604409:4:::6618026:4:::6665290:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5584168:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6461332:4:::5335750:4:::5690767:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5719918:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::6615845:4:::6615845:4:::6218348:4:::5624457:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5719974:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5961041:4:::5302119:4:::5302119:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Tesco Trifle Sponges::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::10.11.2008::::    I will probably be buying these trifle sponges for making a trifle this Christmas season. They are Tesco s trifle sponges in a packet of eight. This pack cost 54p that s 7p each .These are not the fingers I wrote about a few days ago but small rectangular sponges. The top of these sponges have a sugar coating. Now when I am making a trifle I often finding myself snaffling one of these sponges and eating it. Brings back childhood memories my mum often used to give me one of these when she was making a trifle.The sponges as I said are covered in a crisp sugar topping. The sponges themselves a plain bland sweet taste, quite moist, moister than the fingers I think. Anyway hands of my trifle sponges. Let s make the trifle if you wish you can cut these sponges in half and spread jam on them, not absolutely necessary but makes them have a fruity sweet flavour. I pit 6 of these trifle sponges into a bowl. If it s a grown up jelly you could add a spoonful of sherry to it is you wished. .I drain a tin of fruit lets have strawberries today, but it could be plain old boring peaches. Sprinkle these evenly amongst the sponges saving the juice. Now make a jelly strawberry today for me. Using a little water when jelly dissolved pour in the fruit juice and any cold water needed to make up to a pint, not over as it will not set.  Now pour the jelly onto the sponges. Wait till jelly sets and make or open a tin of custard to pour over the jelly to top the trifle. Now when it s all cold and set you can put some sprinkles on the jelly if you wish or pipe some cream onto it. These tesco trifles make a pretty fine trifle. They do contain wheat and eggs, milk too.

I paid 20p the RRP on the back of the book is    10.99pThis book is suitable for key stage 1 or 2. Children between 4 and 7 years old,This story is a traditional southern Asian story. It has elements of the Red riding hood story we know. In this story though is about the grandma, who is frail, all skin and bones she is visiting the granddaughter who lives the other side of the forest.The forest is full of fierce hungry animals. Grandma walks through the forest  quot;her stick went tagook tagook quot; she met many animals first a wolf, who jumps out at her saying BOO. The wolf says old woman I am going to eat you all up. The old woman manages to persuade the wolf that although she is all skin and bone now she is going to her granddaughters house where she will get nice and fat and that the wolf should wait till she is on her way home when she will be fatter. The old woman continues on her journey tagook, tagook and then the meets a bear who says boo and repeats the same words as the wolf. The old woman again persuades the bear not to eat her now but wait till she has feasted at her granddaughter s house. Tagook, tagook on the old woman went this time she came across a tiger that jumped out at her. She had the same conversation with the tiger to the one she had with the wolf, and bear. This time she continues tagook, tagook and reaches her granddaughters house.At her granddaughters house she eats lots and then wonders how she will get home safely. Her granddaughter scrapes out an enormous pumpkin, grandma hides in it and the granddaughter gives the pumpkin a push. The Pumpkin rolled galook galook first past the tiger who asks the pumpkin  quot;have you seen a little old woman.  quot; the old woman from inside the pumpkin replies no I m just a pumpkin rolling home the pumpkin rolls on past the bear who also asks the same question the old woman inside the pumpkin replies the same. The pumpkin passes the wolf the same conversation goes on, but the wolf says  quot;just a minute. I have never heard a talking pumpkin before quot; The old woman admits it s her but says she did not get fat at her granddaughters house.  quot;Show me quot; says the wolf the old woman puts out her walking stick instead of the leg the wolf asks for. The wolf says bother and pushes the pumpkin away the pumpkin and grandma rolls safely back to her home and is met by her dog. And so the story ends.This book is quite good. Children love the repetition when grandma meets the different animals. The illustrations are good the colours rich and vibrant reds orange and greens.My grand son aged 6 enjoyed this book a bit old maybe slightly scarey for my 2 1/2 year old gdaughter.

       " '5247778::::Pyrex Glass Jug::::Household Appliances::::50::::very helpful::::02.11.2008::::    Pyrex Classic Jug 0.5ltrI expect a lot of houses have a Pyrex product in the kitchen Pyrex has made toughened heat resistant glass kitchen ware since 1915, before them this firm developed toughened glass for light bulbs in 1879.I expect a lot of people will call any toughened glass casserole or plate Pyrex even though it is made by someone else and does not have the Pyrex name stamped on it.I have for many years had a real Pyrex measuring jug, a modern one as it measures both in pint and liters. I find this jug very useful , I can and do use it to measure quantities of liquid to add to my recipes., When making scotch pancakes I use it to measure the quantity of milk , when making a jelly I use it to measure the water.  I use it to cook custard in the microwave mixing the powder in the bottom of it then topping up to the required measurement. I use it for making gravy, I use it for so many other things I have to heat in the microwave , I do not have to know how many litres of beans I am heating but this is a handy vessel to heat them in .My Pyrex measuring jug is a 1 pint1/2 a litre jug. It is a clear glass the measurements marked of on a vertical red line with horizontal marks. The litre marks are measures in 50 mls with the 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500, written on them. The pint line is measured in    ,    ,     and 1 pint marks, fluid ounces are also marked on the pint line. This jug can be put in the dishwasher to clean. My Pyrex jug is still as clear as the day it was bought, no stains on the glass and I have used it 1000000 s of times.  After washing the jug is not tainted with the flavour of  the product that was cooked in it so the onion soup  that I heated does not taint the custard .it is an easy jug to hold with a n easy to grip side handle. I have dropped mine several times as yet it has not broken. I would certainly recommend this jug. This jug would make an ideal present for a wedding, ideal to have if you are a student as you can measure and cook with it. It can be used for non food related uses too. I think there ids a ten year guarantee with all Pyrex products This jug retails for between    1.50 and    2 Available in many stores both on and of line.jj     ::::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6671860:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5624457:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::6242691:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6723294:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5752942:4:::6647513:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::5719974:4:::5719918:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5307595:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5837129:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6310942:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5961041:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5805660:4:::6609678:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6239059:4:::6705095:4:::6705095:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5746319:4:::5746319:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Sponge Finger::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::01.11.2008::::    The family was coming for Sunday lunch so I decided to make a trifle for dessert.. These fingers come in a 200g packet plenty and more for a trifle or two. There are 40 fingers in a packet... This pack of sponge fingers was not too expensive it cost 62p Opening the packet I took out a sponge finger it measured about 8cm /3 inches long and about 1cm nearly     inch thick.  These sponge fingers were a golden brown, one side covered in sugar the other side had BOUDOIR printed on it.I tried one before I added it to the trifle I took a bite it was hard the inside a paler colour tiny little bubbles in it where the mix had air incorporated into it .. The taste sweet sugary plain, correction very sweet. Let s look at the calories 19calories per5g. I made my trifle putting a few sponge fingers in the bowl first before adding the jelly. The fingers absorbed the jelly well. (Trifle recipe end of review). We had a portion of trifle for our desert. It was a good trifle the sponge fingers were fine cant say I noticed their flavour much over the orange jelly.So I think for those Christmas parties and teas these Tesco sponge fingers will make a fine trifleI used about 10 trifle fingers. 1 orange jelly (can be any flavour)A tin of orange segments (for a better trifle use fresh or frozen fruit) Custard, I cheated used a can. Some whipped cream and sprinkles to finish.I did not use sherry due to the fact children were consuming mine but a few tablespoons might be added sprinkles over the sponges at the beginningThe sponge fingers were put in a bowl with the orange segments scattered evenly throughout , Jelly mad with boiling water the juice from the can of fruit added to make up to the suggested quantity on the pack. This then was poured over the fingers and fruit .I let this set for about 3 hours in the fridge. Then put the custard on top and decorated. This is a very simple trifle recipe   you can find more elaborate ones making your own custard from scratch but I just wanted a quick easy trifle, it tasted fine.     ::::5633146:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6671860:3:::5719918:3:::6616219:3:::6616219:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5624457:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5584168:3:::6242691:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::21963:4:::6288851:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719974:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6448877:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6701923:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5837129:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6609678:4:::6474927:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6717735:4:::6717735:4:::6331761:4:::6331761:4:::6557505:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5331868:4:::5331868:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6665290:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Barbie Duvet Covers and Pillowcases::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::27.10.2008::::    I was at the charity shop again passing on some old toys and I spotted a single bed Barbie duvet cover and pillow case. It was in good condition I just had to have it for the spare quilt on what we refer to as Cassie s bed. Well my 2.1/2 year old grandchild sleeps there when they stay over night or if she needs a nap.  This quilt cover is pink, of course it is Most Barbie bedding is. In fact most girlie things are pink these days  , this liberated woman would not have anything pink herself her daughter rarely wore pink as a baby but so many little girl things are pink these days can rarely get another colour . Still my gdaughter likes pink. The Barbie duvet cover I bought has a white panel on the top with a picture of Barbie wearing pink of course the word Barbie is written across this white panel, in pink of course. Surrounding Barbie on her white panel is a border of pink. In this pink border there is another white border to the Barbie picture framing Barbie. On this border there are a few flowers. Turn the duvet cover over. The other side is completely pink with flowers printed on pink purple white yellow flowers. The pillow case is matching pink with flowers printed on too. Oh this set is pink so very pink...  I do not know the precise name of this set.  There are several different picture of Barbie on other quilt covers they are mostly pink tooThe fabric is 100   cotton. Which is good I t washes well, irons easily. Seems to be long lasting, I think your child will outgrow this Barbie quilt before it wears out.  This quilt and others similar are available second hand at EBay for a pound and over. Argos has a Barbie duvet cover for    17.99p. http://www.charactercomforts.co.uk/productdetail.php?pro_id=114 has some for    15.99 Overall, I think that this quilt cover is good for a Barbie girl; I can always shut the door when the grand children are not visiting and I do not have to sleep under it.     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5522492:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5480196:3:::5480196:3:::5719918:3:::5624457:3:::6242691:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6657499:4:::6657499:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5719974:4:::6701923:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5961041:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6374904:4:::5816422:4:::6665290:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6693128:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::6708159:4:::6708159:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5837129:4:::6391216:4:::5551379:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6239059:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Begonias::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::18.10.2008::::    Yet another plant that I rescued from my dear departed Dad s house is a begonia.The begonia that I rescued and care for is Begonia rex and is grown as a houseplant, it can be planted outside in the summer but is not winter hardy.This plant has very attractive dark green leaves with red swirls too; in fact some of my plants leaves are redder than green. The Begonia that I have is grown more for its foliage than for the insignificant white flowers. There are many other begonias usually bright red, pink, yellow or white colored flowers. These can be grown in flower borders or planters in the garden or on the patio. Some are good for hanging baskets. The color s are bright. You can get double or single flowers on a begonia. Personally I am not over keen on begonia flowers the petals somehow seem a bit false and waxy, I prefer simple flowers like daisies.Begonias flower from June till October; you may have a last few flowers hanging on. But they will soon look messy flowers and leaves fading and rotting. Underneath is the tuber this is a bit like a bulb and will regrow next year. If you can and your begonias are in a frosty area dig them up remove the soil and leave the tuber in a frost free place over winter., does not have too be dark Planting outside again after the frosts next year . You can start your begonia tubers growing again inside in February March time by keeping the soil or compost a little wet. Plant them outside after the frosts April May time.If you have indoor begonias do not over water equally do not let them dry out water less in winter. The leaves will turn yellow to let you know something is wrong. Keep an indoor begonia quite warm between 15 c and 31c.There are many gardening websites about begonias I found the websitehttp://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publication s/pubs/garden1206/begoniarex.asp very useful when I inherited my plant .     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::6616219:3:::6616219:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5001503:3:::6302441:3:::5341620:3:::5764692:3:::5764692:3:::6593729:3:::6439681:3:::6439681:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5633146:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6288851:4:::5696535:4:::5696535:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5719918:4:::5365437:4:::5365437:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::21963:4:::5719974:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6703676:4:::6703676:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6242691:4:::6239059:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6705796:4:::6705796:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6609678:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Jardins Artigus, Spain::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::13.10.2008::::    Antonio Gaud      - was a Catalan architect who was born in 1852. I really like his work and have visited some of the sites that he is famous for in Barcelona, This year we stayed in the Spanish Pyrenees   near the town of la Pobla de Lillet. We caught a narrow gauge tourist train from Pobla de lillet this took us about 10 minutes to the Jardins Artigus. Antoni Gaudi was commissioned by Joan Artigas to design this garden near his factory.  This garden was constructed between 1902 and 1910. Stone masons and sculptures   created the paths, arches, waterfalls, bridges, and sculptures. Gaudi s work blends in with the natural aspect of this site.  This garden is not a flower garden only a few flowers here the browns of the rock sculptures and the greens of the leaves compliment the rocky backdrop of the mountains beyond. Gaudi has used natural rocks. On the train platform is a small kiosk where we paid 3 euros each to get into this garden. We entered the gardens by descending down some steps. As we went down the path we could see the garden it was a good view .We turned left and came to a waterfall and a relief of some stone pines some real trees in front off the stone trees   complimented their shape. We came to a face of an ox that sprouted water through its mouth. Following the path down we went into a  cave  structure it was cool, in here there are two entrances to this area and 2 opening to let some light in and to get a view of the river.We went up  steps  to an ornate bridge crossing the river Llobregat  this had  two pillars at the entrance with plants in the top  .This led to  a sculpture of and eagle made with small stones that was fantastic the eagle looked as if it were about to take of .   There were resting places at different levels to enable us to take the view of this park and the backdrop of mountains in. There are rails along this bridge that imitate tree trunks with bark. Over the bridge there is a down hill zigzaggy path, this leads us to an area where there is a stone table and seat. From this  the El Puente de los Arcos: bridge of arches  crosses the river again this is a  bridge with 5 arches made of stone at the  either side of beginning of this bridge were   sculpture of man and a woman each with a basket on their head  . This bridge is truly an amazing piece of work we sat on the benches and drunk the sight in for a while. The other side of the bridge took us back to the bottom of our entrance path again so we ascended back to the train. Walking around the garden took us about 45 minutes the train went hourly so this was a good time to spend here. There were not many other visitors when we went so it was quiet which was good as this is a tranquil spot one to look and wonder at the art. I found the stone work fascinating. The lines of the stone arches were perfect. I did not think these gardens suitable for a wheel chair user. In the summer these gardens are open 10am till 7 pm from October to June they are open only weekends 10am till 5pm Antoni Gaudi was commissioned by Joan Artigas to design this garden near his factory.  This garden was constructed between 1902 and 1910. Stone masons and sculpturers   created the paths, arches, waterfalls, bridges, and sculptures. Gaudi s work blends in with the natural aspect of this site. Sorry I have not been able to name and describe all the sculptures as we walked around  do visit  http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA019 20Artigas 20Gardens.htm for good descriptions of the art pieces .After 1932 the gardens were neglected and fell into disrepair it was not till 1971 that interest in these gardens were renewed. Work to repair the gardens was commenced in 1992. We can now view these gardens and the sculptures designed by Gaudi.Gaudi died in 1926 he was run over by a tram in Barcelona. Because he looked like a tramp with no money no one would take him to a hospital someone did eventually take him to a pauper s hospital when his friends found him the next day and tried to move him into a better hospital, Gaudi refused, reportedly saying  I belong here among the poor.  If you are in this area I would certainly recommend a visit to these gardens.

       " '5247778::::Hama Blower Brush::::Cameras::::50::::very helpful::::10.10.2008::::    I will huff and I will puff and I will blow your lens clean. At least the Hama green 00005607 brushes will.  A blower brush is an invaluable camera accessory. Dust and specks of dirt get onto a camera lens and if you take a photo of Aunt Jane you will   see specks of dirt on the print, that s no good. So a blower brush is a useful tool. This green one made by Hama has a round rubber bulb 40mm in diameter. Squeeze this bulb and air will travel down the 45mmlong tube/neck. To the brush at the end this brush is small and has soft fine hairs. If just the air does not remover the dust spec then you can brush it off with this soft brush. This brush is useful for blowing, brushing dust away from any optical equipment. Be carefull do not attempt to brush sand off your lens try and blow it away or you may get scratches. The Hama blower brush does not give such a strong blast of air as the Giotto air rockets that I wrote about in an earlier review. The rubber bulb has circular ridges running round it . It is quite firm needs a good squeeze, I have used softer to squeeze air brushes. I think this blower brush will last quite a long time without perishing. The one I have is my dads he has had it quite a while. Hamas is a german company  was founded in  Dresden Germany in 1923 . Now there is a UK  headquarters  in Basingstoke, Hampshire . Blower brushes are not very expensive this one costs    6.29 plus    6.18p shipping from http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/detail/offer-listing/-/B00006IVK9/ne w I am sorry I can not find this anywhere else on line I checked the Dixon s and the Jessop s camera shop sites. I guess dad bought or had this given to him a while ago. Overall this is very similar to many other blower brushes that are available.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Pain aux Chocolat::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::07.10.2008::::    Pain aux chocolat Hands up who likes chocolate. We visited France this year and I consume several of these chocolate bread buns.  The better ones coming from bakers in villages not the major supermarkets.  Theses have not been available in England till recent years and I miss the thrill of visiting forieng countries and finding foods I am not familiar with at home, I think these taste better in France than in England any way. So let me describe a pain aux chocolate also called a chocolatine we found in the South west of France. The translation of the French name literally is chocolate bread.  Pain aux chocolate is made with Brioche dough which is buttery bread dough. This is rolled out to a rectangle then chocolate pieces a bit like chocolate drops, sprinkled on to it. The dough then rolled up Swiss roll like and baked. (Recipe at end of review.)These pain aux cocolat taste a butterery bready flavor.  Each bite contains some chocolate pieces, These bread buns are often eaten for breakfast, they are good as a mid morning snacking or as a dessert in a packed lunch they are also fantastic with a cup of tea in the afternoon. I supposed you could eat them at a high tea .They go down well as an evening snack too. These pain aux chocolat are really at their best straight from the bakers still warm. They are also good if you warm them in the oven yourself before eating.  You can of course eat these delicious chocolate breads cold too. You can buy pain aux colcolat in most bakers and supermarkets in France individually or in a bag with lots in. In England Tesco sell a bag of ten for    1.74. I can not remember or find the French price but I think for an individual pain aux chocolate it was just under 1 eurosRECIPE 500g strong white flour15g Salt 75g Sugar25g Yeast270ml water400g Butter Make these ingredients in to a bread dough leave to rise.  roll out the dough into a rectangle spread with an apricot or any other jam and sprinkle chocolate  onto it ( chocolate drops / buttons or chunks from any chocolate is good , mars bar pieces work well ) Brush some milk or beaten egg on top for a glaze Roll this up Swiss roll like cut into small pieces and bake at 200 c for 15 -20 mins.     ::::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6242691:4:::6239059:4:::6288851:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5696535:4:::5696535:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5522492:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6214353:4:::6214353:4:::6521661:4:::5454586:4:::5439461:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::5961041:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5445547:4:::5805660:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5719974:4:::6660163:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6609678:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5307595:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6709697:4:::6709697:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6378505:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Playmobil Pigs and Family::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::05.10.2008::::    I was playing farms with the children last week and some of the animals I played with were the playmobil farmyard pig and piglets. These pigs generally come with one of the playmobil farm sets but can be bought separately as an add on set. Often these pigs will just come in a bag not as box.  This pack of pigs costs around    5.00. You can purchase this item on line at the playmobil shop http://www.playmobil.de/on/demandware.store/Sites-GB-Site/en_ GB/Product-Detail?pid=7021 cgid=Included in the pack of farmyard pigs are one adult pig and 6 little piglets.   The mother /father pig the same design as the piglets only bigger. These pig/lets are made of a pink plastic. This is a smooth safe plastic. Each animal has the pig s curly tail, its rounded body and 4 legs. The legs do not move they are molded onto the body, Now to the head , this is movable fitted so that it moves up and down .This means you can make the pig move his head up and down at the feeding trough .  The pig face is shaped so that it has a snout under the mouth is a smiling indented mouth there are two piggy ears perkily pointing upwards. Two little piggy eyes are indented into the face too the features are friendly. This set comes with a brown feeding trough for the pigs to feed at. This set is recommended for children aged 4 and over. I think it is a safe toy. This toy would be alright for a slightly younger child just watch they do not try to put the piglets in their mouths, although quite large I think the piglets would go into a child s mouth.  I think that by the age of 6 or 7 that these pigs might be a bit babyish and if you want a toy farm you will find others more suitable for an older child .This really is a good addition to a playmobil farm set or a gift for a child who likes pigs.This toy will help promote your child s imaginative play. It will help develop their knowledge of animals. I think this toy is best played with other playmobil farm toys your child can then put them in a pen or load them onto the truck to take them to market. While you play alongside or with your child you can introduce new appropriate words to their vocabulary like pig mother piglet trough you can name the pig body parts. These pigs are useful for learning early math s counting the piglets.This pig family is good for helping develop a child s motor skills, grasping, moving, and placing positioning.  These pig and piglets being a smooth plastic are easy to clean should they get dirty, just a hot soapy wash.Playmobil toys are very good  They are a German company started in 1876 making metal locks and fittings by the 1920 s they were making metal toys. In 1958 they made hula hoops out of plastic and with this new plastic molding system other plastic toys developed and by the 1970 s playmobil toys were developed and now are very popular. Playmobil toys are very durable and ideal for nursery play school or home use. These pigs make a good addition to any toy farmDo have fun playing / watching with your child and their toys childhood passes so quickly. It is a time when your child is learning so much just by playing so give them lots of opportunities.     ::::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::6242691:4:::5633146:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5522492:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5784644:4:::6603737:4:::5584168:4:::5719974:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6288851:4:::6660163:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5312069:4:::5312069:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5961041:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6461332:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6609678:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5373984:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

These are a pack of value biscuits I am reviewing.  300g of biscuits for 25p can t get much cheaper than that. There are about 25 or 26 biscuits in a pack so 1p a biscuit can t be bad. Mc Vities 300g rich tea pack costs 71p from Tesco so as you can tell from the price. Rich tea biscuits are not the most exciting of biscuit.The Tesco value pack comes in the standard value packaging white with blue writing  a picture of a couple of biscuits on it too , blue ends of the paper seal the end of the biscuit pack .. If you do not wish your friends to notice that you are so poor/mean you have to buy value biscuits then unwrap put them in a biscuit tin or arrange on a plate to serve.Personally I am not desperately keen on rich tea biscuits of any kind. The Tesco value rich tea are an ok biscuit a certainly not much different to any other rich tea biscuit. I am putting 7 of these biscuits on a plate. You will know why in a minute. I look at them they are flat and round, I guesstimate about 2 inches in diameter. They are a light golden brown in colour and have a few holes pricked in them. I am sorry I am tempted to eat one It is crisp as I said bland the ingredients, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Vegetable Oil, Raising Agents (Ammonium Bicarbonate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Disodium Diphosphate), Barley Malt Extract, Glucose Syrup, Salt, Preservative (Sodium Metabisulphite). Nothing to worry about there, unless I am offering to someone with wheat allergies. I note though they are made in a factory that uses nut so I will not offer to someone with a nut allergy either If left out to long they will go soggy. So I hurry up and call the children in. I have some white icing made up and some writing icing too a few decorative sprinkles and silver balls. We are going to decorate these biscuits it is my son in laws birthday and the family have come for tea. The children 2 and 6 generally slop icing onto the biscuits and squirt the writing icing on. They sprinkle and put the silver balls on; the biscuits look fantastic children daddy will love them with his cup of tea. My 6 year old child is a bit more creative with his designs than the 2 year old he has made a face on his. The biscuits do not stay crisp long when decorated but its ok we are eating them very soon. Placed in an air tight container they will stay crisper that bit longer. But who cares they are iced in such an exquisite way by the children.There are 36 calories per biscuit so not too bad unless you eat one of my spectacularly iced biscuits.  (Fantastic for children s Christmas parties)     ::::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5522492:3:::6700603:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::6448877:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::21963:4:::6242691:4:::6288851:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5696535:4:::5696535:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6666536:4:::6666536:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::6647513:4:::6711901:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5719918:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6662488:4:::6662488:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6557505:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6660163:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6461332:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6603737:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6457531:4:::6457531:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::5347743:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5719974:4:::6609678:4:::6694578:4:::6694578:4:::6709697:4:::6709697:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6474927:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " \"5247778::::John Lewis Deluxe Combi Doll's Pram, Pink Stripe::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::01.10.2008::::    Ohh she is a very young parent pushing her baby in that awesome pink combi pram from john Lewis. The baby is all snuggled up sleeping I am walking with my granddaughter She is pushing baby in the pram to the local park. My grandchild is 2     going on 30 baby is made of plastic she cries and wee s too. We bought this dolls pram for my granddaughter for her second birthday; it was really a bit big for her more suitable for a 3 year old. But I bought it bigger than she really could push so she would get more use out of it as she got older.This pram has reversible handles which are adjustable in height between 58cm and 82cm, so it can fit Cassie as she grows. A good feature is that this pink doll s pram has 3 combinations for carrying dolly:  it can be a pushchair, a pram, or a soft carrier. Mummy or Nana has to help Cassie change between the combinations, but I am sure that soon she will be able to manage on her own.There is a fitted hood that can be raised to shield baby from the rain or the suns rays. Underneath the pram is a fitted shopping basket we have the babies bottle and a toy dog in ours on the walk to the park.This pram is easy to push and steer it has brakes to put on when we stop.We have not got the coordinated rucksack with us today this is at home has babies nappies and clothes in it. This rucksack is a good size for a small child to put their baby s possessions in or the shopping that they are buying.This dolls pram looks quite stunning beautiful girly pink. It is two shades of pink blocks of pink on the hood and the body and the apron. The edges of the hood and the pram Apron are small stripe. The rucksack has coordinating pink stripes on the pocket and closure flap of the two pinks. This really is a deluxe modelThis pram is very well made, sturdy and should last a long time, It should be though as it costs Nana     44.95.   Spoilt grandchildren. However I think this dolls pram rather good and I am happy I bought it for my granddaughter.     ::::5522492:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5646482:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6145850:4:::5719918:4:::6448877:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::6242691:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6248607:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6161004:4:::6161004:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6645904:4:::6645904:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6603737:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5719974:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5961041:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6617478:4:::6701923:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5620008:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6377619:4:::6377619:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5717149:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6609678:4:::6660163:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " \"5247778::::Rachel's Organic Bio-live Low Fat Yogurt with Vanilla::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::29.09.2008::::    Rachel makes good yoghurt one she makes very well is the vanilla one that I consume. I have been eating a lot of yoghurt recently. One I enjoy is Rachel s organic fat free vanilla yoghurt. I usually buy mine in tesco s, its easy foe me to shop there. Rachel s vanilla yoghurt is in a 450g pot quite a plain but attractive black and white pattern with a single creamy yellow flower on the label.  This yoghurt costs   1.16   for the large 450g pot which is about 4 servings.This yoghurt is quite thick and a creamy texture and colour. It tastes good too I often buy the yeo valley vanilla yoghurt too. I find the at Rachel s vanilla yoghurt is not quite as sweet as the Yeo valley one and it has more of that slightly sour yoghurt taste than the Yeo valley one. I prefer the Yeo valley vanilla yoghurt my husband the Rachel s yoghurt although the differences are minimal we both like both yoghurts.This vanilla yoghurt is ideal for eating on its own or with added fruit strawberries and raspberries are perfect with this yoghurt as is stewed sweetened rhubarb the vanilla yoghurt really adds something to stewed rhubarb its delicious . This is what I shall be eating for desert tonight when I get round to stewing some rhubarb soon. I feel good about eating Rachel s yoghurt it is organic and also its fat free and live which means is doubly good for me. . Live yoghurts contain bacteria which are good for the intestine and digestion.Rachel s dairies first started in West Wales in the 1980 s as a small  farmhouse operation it is now owned by Deans foods. Rachel s Organic is now one of the major processors of organic milk in Wales. The organic vanilla yoghurt sold in many places, so go on try some with you strawberries instead of cream .     ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5633146:3:::5522492:3:::6603187:3:::6603187:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::6703676:3:::6703676:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5584168:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5719918:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5961041:3:::5719974:3:::5399986:3:::5399986:3:::6660163:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6609678:3:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::21963:4:::6242691:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5620008:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6378505:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6557505:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5261772:4:::5717149:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5373984:4:::6646083:4:::6646083:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6709697:4:::6709697:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5307595:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Bahlsen First class chocolate biscuits::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.09.2008::::    Bahlsen have been making biscuits for over 100 years, their headquarters in Hanover, Germany, they now make and market biscuits in many other countries too. Bahlsen make several varieties of chocolate biscuit but the one I chose was a milk chocolate one. I bought my 125g pack at Tesco s price was    1.25p for a packet. You can also buy them at other supermarkets for around the same price. The packet a slim rectangular cardboard one. Inside a plastic tray with 3 compartments each one containing 4 biscuits. . The biscuits are rectangular. A sweet buttery golden brown biscuit which has been half dipped in dairy milk chocolate. The  frilly edge of the biscuit is attractively marked and in the centre of the both the biscuit and the  chocolate side  the words choco Leibniz is scrolled It is not a mean covering of chocolate but a good thick one that you can get your teeth into and have a good bite .  In fact I think this biscuit is more chocolate than biscuit so it s a chocolate with biscuit embedded in it really .The biscuit tastes good buttery and the chocolate is a fine dairy milk chocolate a good taste. These biscuits are good. Nutritionally well each biscuit has 70 calories in it. That s okish as it is chocolate after all and 1 biscuit a reasonable size and would satisfy. As you can imagine these do contain milk and butter, wheat too so check the ingredients if you have allergies as these would probably not suit you. Yes I would recommend these biscuits good to give to visitors. Thanks for reading, remember do not eat too many of these biscuits save some for me.     ::::5522492:3:::6161004:3:::6161004:3:::6456362:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5584168:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6242691:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5510910:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5690767:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5719974:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5837129:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::6617478:4:::6448877:4:::6609678:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Dry wipe erasor::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::22.09.2008::::    I have already written reviews about white boards and dry wipe white board marker pens, so let me tell you about dry wipe erasers .I have used a variety of dry wipe pen erasers. Basically a dry wipe eraser is cuboids with one edge a fluffy fleecy fabric wipe.Some erasers have several layers of disposable wipe fabrics just peel them off and you get a clean one. There is one available from http://www.dineens.co.uk costing    4.25 this looks similar if not the same as one I have used it has 10 fabric peels off erasers they are on a grey plastic cuboids holder, they were ok to use but I prefer other ones.Berol dry wipe erasers come in 2 sizes the bigger ones cost around    3.00 the mini ones just over    1 each. These are fully washable the smaller ones come with a plastic grip that has to be removed before washing. They are easy to hold and use and are very effective at removing white board pen from the non magnetic white boards.There are several other dry wipe board erasors available mostly they retail between    3 and    5 For magnetic white boards you can buy an eraser, I have used the ones like those at http://www.euroffice.co.uk/i/wnl/Artline-Drywipe-Whiteboard-Eraser-Magnetic -for-Magnetic-Boards-Blue-Ref-ERTMMBLU costing about three pounds. If you have old dirty marks on your dry wipe bourds look at http://www.wikihow.com/Erase-Old-Marks-off-a-Dry-Erase-Board they have some good cleaning tips.     ::::5719918:3:::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::6023030:3:::6023030:3:::21963:3:::5522492:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5633146:3:::6456362:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6448877:3:::6639882:3:::6639882:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6456238:3:::6456238:3:::5961041:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6310942:4:::6242691:4:::6288851:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5510910:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6603737:4:::5719974:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5373984:4:::6708189:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6609678:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6474927:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6660163:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5690767:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Cheese and Spring Onion Sandwich Filler::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::20.09.2008::::    For a quick easy tasty filling in a sandwich I often buy Tesco s cheese and onion sandwich filler.  This is available in 2 sizes 170g or 400g. The pric4e for the 170g is 88p on offer at the mo for 71p. The 400g one costs    1.96 price. This filler comes in a plastic cuboid pot and is on the chilled sandwich filler shelf. Basically this sandwich filler is grated cheese in mayonnaise with onion.Although nut free made in factory containing nuts, also containing eggs ands milk it may not be good for those with allergies.  There are 1750kJ/424kcal in 100g  so not the most slimming lunch Opening the pot you get a cheesy slightly onion aroma. Digging my knife in to get some to spreads the consistency is good quite thick. This filler spreads easily onto my bread for my sandwiches; I can see the bits of grated cheese and fine chopped onion in the mayonnaise as I spread.  The small pot of filler is enough to make 3 or 4 sandwiches, enough for 2 days, At lunch time I eat my sandwich it is really tasty   it is cheesy with the onion to complement it.Tesco I would recommend this sandwich filler and I expect to buy it again and again. Unless that is I make my own by grating some cheese stirring in some mayonnaise and chopped onion ,  the other day I did that and chopped chives in instead of onion it was v tasty , probably cheaper. I looked at the ingredients and  48 is the mayonnaise  40 cheese. You could always add a chopped tomato to this for a change.

       " '5247778::::Tren del Ciment, Spain::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::16.09.2008::::    When we were on holiday in the Spanish Pyrenees somewhere I wanted to visit was the Jardins Artigus near la Pobla de Lillet and Castellar de n hug   We decided to catch the tourist train Ferrocarril Tur   stic de l Alt Llobregat  This train once was the train that used to run cement from the cement factory at Casteller de n Hug. This train is really a tourist train now it runs from   the train museum at Pobla to the cement factory museum nr Casteller de n hug where there are guided tours. The train stops  in the centre of Pobla  after 4 or 5 minutes  then carries on to stop by the entrance to the Jardins Artigus about  13 minutes from the start the complete journey to the ciment factory  where it terminates takes about 20 minutes We did the complete journey but in two stages looking round the Jardfins Artigus then catching the train onto the  cement museum. We got to the end of the line at the museum but discovered we had got there at the beginning of the 2 hour lunch break                            .. We should have checked before we began our journey. The train turns round here and returns back to Pobla ten minutes later. We had got off the train and walked away so had to catch the next train back an hour later. There is a caf    at the station here so we had a drink and we could have had something to eat but I had a picnic with us so we walked of and found somewhere to eat. Returning to Pobla de lillet we looked around the small railway museum by the side of the station The timetable is quite good trains run hourly check the timetable at http://www.fgc.net/accesible/eng/ociturisme/tren_turistic.htm as they differ depending on the season. The hour between trains was ideal for us to walk around the jardins Artigus, and I think would have been ok at the ciment museum. However we did not go into the museum, something to do another year. This train journey its self is good, goes on a scenic route and is a pleasant journey a good way of getting to both the gardens and the museum adding a little extra to the day out.  The train goes through some fantastic mountain views round corners over a bridge If you wish to see a video of this train journey go to http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=MmgTdeHDDg0 seeIf you are going to this area I would recommend this journey and looking around the jardins Artigus and the train museum. I would like to go again and visit the ciment factory This journey cost us 5 euros its 2.50 for a child special rates for groups.

This cake weighs 291g. Lyles have been making this cake  for about 20 years (or ones like it )This cake is wrapped in a green and blue plastic foil wrapper with the Tate and Lyle s lion on it. This wrapper keeps the cake moist and fresh for quite a long time, use by dates is usually a long way ahead.This cake is a lovely golden brown colourI love golden syrup, (I can remember eating golden syrup on bread as a nipper) and this cake is no exception. I will sometimes eat this cake with a cup of tea, sometimes for a pudding warmed up and served with custard or cream perhaps some golden syrup poured onto it. I think I acrually prefer to eat it warmed as a pudding .This cake is moist and sweet you can taste the golden syrup Slimming pudding? No way very fattening full of calories 335 per 100g. I think you could probably get 4 or 5 fair servings out of this cake for a pudding.  This cake is not suitable if you have a nut allergy it s made in a factory that uses nuts in other products, it contains egg too, dairy protein and wheat flour. This cake is available as the one large cake I have written about or as a pack with individual cakes in it. I have recently bought two large cakes on a buy one get one free deal.

       " '5247778::::Wow Tot Wet and Wobblies::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::11.09.2008::::    Wow, wet and wobblies toy.I was playing in our nursery class today with toys from the interactive toy box. I found the wet and wobblies . These toys are a set of 4 Jellyfish they are a motorized bath toy set. They are made by WOW toys. There is daddy jelly fish, a blue jellyfish that has a cheerful face. Daddy jellyfish is a scoop that has 3 holes, so be careful the water does not come out. Little sister jelly fish is yellow and red. She has a green head, the green head is a plunger push it and she will squirt water. Mummy jelly fish yellow with a smiling face has baby attached to her by a string. Pull out the baby jelly fish and he wobbles and shakes back to his mummy. I played mostly with mummy and baby jelly fish as we did not have water play. The child I was with enjoyed watching the jelly fish move and pulled the baby jelly fish away from mummy to watch him wobbling back. This toy is good for motor skills and cause and reaction. After a few times the child I was with would anticipate that baby jelly fish would return to mummy.This makes a good bath or water tray toy. A good size for tot to play with. Attractive colours too.  These toys were available on line but recently Wow toys have stopped on line trading. You can however buy this in many toy shops see http://www.wowtoys.com/Web/Pages/WOW-Stockists.jsp for a list. This wet and wobbly set of toys costs    9.99 which I think a reasonable price. Have fun playing with your children and their toys.

Champion supermarkets are also in other countries Belgium, Spain, Poland, Greece and Turkey and in South America, Argentina, Brazil. But I have only shopped in them in France. The first store opened in October 1969 in Bayeux France. Champion supermarkets are much like other large supermarkets I guess.   There is a large store in Calais and Champion sell brand name items and their own label items too .They sell household items for cleaning,  other household items too brushes , crockery , toiletries ,dairy products, meat fresh vegetables tinned food , chilled foods , ready made meals ,  frozen foods. Wine.  Several familiar British goods are available Lots of things more than I remember.  The items for sale are displayed fairly well notices to tell you which product in which aisle, my French just about good enough to understand these.  The champions I have been in are fairly well laid out aisles a reasonable width. Trolleys are as good as British ones and you need a euro to get one just like you need a pound in the UK.The stores I have been in are clean enough; I have used their public loos which are passable.If we are self catering or camping we tend to go to champion to stock up on food and bits for the week too . There is a large store in Calais ideal for us to buy wine to take home , this store attracts many day shopping trippers to France. After a holiday in France we stocked up here with wine for my daughters wedding a few years agoChampion supermarkets have web sites just like tesco and other stores have, home delivery is available.  Just search champion supermarkets and you well get a list of stores and sites. In the  specific criteria  it asks how often I visit the options were not wide enough for me to put once maybe twice a year so I put monthly  the other near option was never  .

       " '5247778::::Berol Colour Broad-Fibre-Tip-Pens::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::09.09.2008::::    We use Berol broad tipped fibre tipped pens at the school where I work. One of my first jobs in the morning is to take out the tray of these pens and put them within easy reach of my students. These broad tip pens are good for writing or colouring pictures they make bold illustrations. They are good for labeling posters too. A wet brush or finger can be used to create a colour wash effect after colouring.  . My students are happy to use these broad tipped pens and I am happy with the results. Berol broad fibre tip pens are one of the many stationary items made by Berol. Berol is owned by Sanford which is one of the biggest writing product manufacturers. These pens come in 12 standard colours, black, blue, red, light blue, brown. Green , light green , yellow, pink , grey, purple ,  orange  and 12 extra colours  deep brown , deep red, magenta,, turquoise , terracotta, peach , violet,, bold green , bright blue, ultra blue , bright red,  deep yellow.  You can buy these fibre tip pens in packs of 12 standard mixed colours or 12 extra colours or a pack of 24 with all the colours. They are also available in larger classroom packs.  It is possible to buy packs of the individual coloured pens. These pens are available on line at http://www.berol.com/productDetail.asp?sectorID=9 productID=7 and other on line stationary stores too. . These pens are available from the stationary catalogues which schools receive. You could also buy these broad  fiber tip pens in off line stationary shops in the high street too.These pens make a broad line 1.77mm they are a good product the colours bold. The pens seem to last quite a long time.  The fibre tips of these pens are rounded. They are not easily pushed in by children pressing too hard. A big advantage to these pens is that the pens do not dry out quickly if the lids are left of. My students have a great habit of not putting lids on pens. I have not done a test to see how long the pens take to dry out but Berol says they will not dry out if lids left of for at least 14 days. The ink of these pens is washable; I have washed pen marks from these pens of most of my work clothes successfully. Yes I would recommend these pens both for school or home use.     ::::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::5633146:4:::6239059:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6310942:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6242691:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5584168:4:::5373984:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6702104:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6448877:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6665290:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5719918:4:::5961041:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6668942:4:::6668942:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6601458:4:::6601458:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5719974:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6609678:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Glastonbury Festival, 2008::::Ciao Caf�::::50::::very helpful::::07.09.2008::::    My 2008 Glastonbury. This year I sat on the grass and listened to bands.  After not being able to get Glastonbury festival tickets for several years ,due to overwhelming demand this year we got tickets easily as they did not sell out till the very last day. This may have been for a variety of reasons , lead bands maybe or bad weather stories ,  ticket prices 150 quid for the weekend .it may just be that there are many more music festivals and events than there used to be in the seventies and eighties ..Now you can sit on my backpack and experience the festival as I did. Sadly due to work commitments I could not get to the festival till Friday evening leaving home north of Oxford we took 3     hours to drive there . When we got to the country lanes a few miles away hubby and I exchanged a conversation do you remember when we used to come (mid seventies through the eighties and nineties I think) it took hours to get on site we would be queued up and desperately anxious to get on site hearing bands in the distance seeing light shows often we would queue for 3 or 4 hours to get through the gates.  This year as in the last few years access has been much easier got straight on to park our car. Parking costs    10 in advance, or on the gate if you forgot your parking pass.Then we trudge our camping kit and essentials onto the festival site. This year it was easy walking as although it had rained  earlier on the Friday when we got there it was dry and the ground although a bit muddy not too bad.  I can remember other years squelching and getting stuck in the mud.This year we took only a few things with us as we were only staying the 2 nights and other years we had taken so much that we got fed up with traipsing it on and off site. We took small 2 man tent, sleeping bags toothbrushes small soap, comb spare pair of knickers and spare t-shirt, light fleece top and waterproofs all squashed in a plastic carrier bag inside a small daysac. Plenty of money divided into various secret places, Small torch, mobile phones. Some medication we left 2 spare changes of clothes in the car just in case one for changing at the festival, one so we were dry going home.We walked about 10 minutes to the gate showed our tickets which this year had our photos on them.  We received wrist bands which we would need + plus our ticket portion if we wanted to go out and return again. We also received the Glastonbury festival guide a glossy mag with info and advertising in it. We also received a small guide that was inside a plastic wallet on a string to keep around our neck s or attached to a belt. We were on site by 8pm. Sad we had missed a few bands we would quite like to have seenWe were meeting friends by the solar showers as they were          Pictures of Glastonbury Festival, 2008     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6239059:4:::5633146:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6242691:4:::5373984:4:::6557505:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6702104:4:::6668942:4:::6668942:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6101464:4:::6101464:4:::5719918:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5717149:4:::5780729:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5719974:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6601458:4:::6601458:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6397261:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6609678:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::6665290:5:::6287172:5:::6287172:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Eurohike Nylon Repair Kit::::Sports & Outdoors::::50::::very helpful::::05.09.2008::::    Oh no I caught my Mac in a sac waterproof coat in the door of the car.  I look at it; it has a small tear in it now. Bother, bother, bother. The tear is only small about a couple of cm /1 inch it is near the hem of the coat.  Shall I throw the coat away? The rip will only get bigger. No I shall repair it and use this waterproof coat to Glastonbury festival; I would not want to take a new one there. I know that I can buy some patches for mending nylon fabrics that tents are made from .So I went into Blacks outdoor equipment shop and bought myself a Eurohike nylon repair kit. This kit cost me    2.99. The nylon repair kit is in a small clear plastic wallet with a card top which gives instructions for use on it .  . I found this pack hanging up on a display rack a hole is punched out of the card top for easy display hanging. I finished the rest of my shopping and went home.After a cup of tea, I looked at the kit and read the instructions.  In this kit were 4 different coloured pieces of nylon fabric, a blue a green a cream a brown each measuring 15cmx71/2cm. each piece of fabric has a backing paper stuck to it.I read the instructions then got my poor ripped waterproof coat.All I had to do was cut a patch big enough to cover the rip; I cut mine a bit bigger than the rip. Then I peeled of the backing paper and carefully stuck the patch over the rip on the inside of my jacket, although not really necessary I cut another small patch and stuck over the rip on the outside of my jacket. Then all I had to do was apply pressure this   I did first by just pressing the fabrics together with my fingers then. I used my iron I did not switch my iron on that would have melted the fabric but just used it cold  to put pressure on the patches. I was happy with my repair and for    2.99p the waterproof jacket will last me a lot longer.These repair kits are good I have used them before to mend rips in nylon tents and other nylon waterproof clothing. The fabrics make quite a good bond and should stay on for many uses. Ok the green colour is not quite the same green as my waterproof but it s not a problem to me. I would defiantly recommend this kit if you get a small rip in your nylon camping /outdoor gear .  excuse the criteria but ciao thinks this is a tent not someting for mending tents or as in my case mending a waterproof jacket     ::::5719918:4:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::6239059:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6242691:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719974:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5312069:4:::5312069:4:::5620008:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6177175:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6609678:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Osteopermum::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::03.09.2008::::    In June I purchased 4 Osteopernum plants from the market they cost me    .5 fop 3. I bought them to perk and cheer up my front garden.This plant is one of the daisy compositae /asteracea family sometimes called cape daisy / South African daisy This plant has several different coloured varieties a range of purples reds whites and yellow. Each variety seems to have a name Sunny something one I notice is sunny Mary  I have this my namesake in the front garden with sunny Carlos a white one and another  whose name I can not remember . This plant has lots of daisy like flowers with a darker centre. The leaves quite broad are toothed. As you can guess from this name this plant is a sun lover. This plant grows to about 30 cm tall and will spread about 90 cm making a short mound covered with blooms. This plant has lots of daisy like flowers with a darker centre.  This plant flowers from June throughout the summer. To keep new flowers coming I have dead headed this plant regularly today sept 3rd I note a couple of flowers on it . I have a very chalky soil the plants seem to like this they like a well drained soil. They will like rockeries or a border. I shall water my plants though as this area gets quite dryOsteospermums are a perennial but are often used like an annual; I shall protect mine from the frosts and see if they will survive till next year. Maybe best to dig them up and put them in the conservatory to over winter.

Berol has developed these triangular pencils for children who are developing their colouring skills. They are easier to hold than the round colouring pencils. The triangular shapes helps children to hold them in a correct grip. Some of my disabled pupils find these easier to hold than standard pencils.The surface of the crayon is a slip resistant texture; it does not slip out of my students sweaty palms so easily. The hand hugger colouring pencil is comfortable to hold. These pencils do not splinter. The leads of these pencils are strong do not break easily. There is a good range or 12 colours available giving a 6mm wide line. To sharpen these pencils you do need a big pencil, sharpener Berol hand hugger crayons /pencils are available from http://www.berol.com/searchDetail.asp?sectorID=0 productID=31  a pack of 12 cost    7.14 at http://www.fun2make.co.uk/Pencils-Colouring-Pencils-and-Crayons_B2887.aspx a pack of 12 cost    6.95.Berol also make hand hugger writing pens and hand hugger colouring pens a pencil sharpener is available with 2 holes one for standard pencils one  a larger hole for hand huggersBerol is a company that makes good writing products it has been around for many years.

       " '5247778::::Cannon E77mm Lens Cap Standard Zoom Lens::::Cameras::::50::::very helpful::::31.08.2008::::    A lens cap is important piece equipment if you want to keep your lens in good repair with no scratches or dirt or grime encrusted on it. The Cannon E77MM lens cap fits my husband s cannon 17-55 ultrasonic zoom lens on his cannon digi camera. .This lens cap came as standard on my husbands zoom lens when he bought it but can be bought separately. This 77mm lens cap cover will cost    5.99p from http://www.askdirect.co.uk/uview?call=ask.productBrowse id=469 topcatid=19  make=Canon. If you go into a good camera shop they will probably have them in stock or be able to order one for you.You do not have to have a cannon camera lens for this lens cap this lens cap cover will fit other makes of lens too, as long as they are 77mm diameter. They do not need to be ultrasonic lens either. This lens cap came as standard on my husbands zoom lens when he bought it but can be If you have a cannon lens with a 77ml diameter you do not have to have a cannon lens cap. Being cannon it is probably more expensive than a generic one and not much difference in the quality.. This cannon snap fit lens cap has an outer and inner ring there is a clip either side of the cover which you can push when you are fitting the cap on to your lens this depressed the inner ring, and when over the lens you release the clip and the lens cap snaps fits onto the lens.This lens cap fits  and grips onto  the inner edge of the  outer rim of the lens  cylinder this makes for a good tight  fit and I think does not  get knocked off as easily as one fitted onto the outer edge of the lens rim. To take the lens cap off all you have to do is depress the clips and it comes off quickly and easily, important if you want to take that snap of the bird that is about to fly away. This lens cap is quick and easy to put on and take off the lens.You can buy different types of lens caps, push on ones too some snap on caps are slightly different mechanisms to this cannon oneThis lens cap is a hard black plastic.  Very strong does not bend. The words Cannon and Ultrasonic are written on the outside. Cannon is written in silver scroll, Ultrasonic in gold. Ultrasonic does not refer to the lens cap but to the lens it came off the motor in the lens works ultrasonically.  The silver and gold writing make the lens cap and hence your camera looks distinguished and professional. Look on the inner face of the lens cap to see the dimension in the centre it says E-77MM Canon Japan this is in raised black writing, so not too easy to see on the black cover. We have traveled many places my husband camera round is neck or in a rucksack or occasionally in a proper camera bag. This lens cap stays on the lens and he has not lost it yet so must be a good fit. . This lens cap keeps my husbands lens clean and scratches free.     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::5336173:4:::5336173:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239059:4:::6288851:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5633146:4:::5646482:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5719974:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5347743:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6647705:4:::6647705:4:::5816422:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6242691:4:::6190414:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5805660:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5813182:4:::5813182:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5961041:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6609678:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::6647517:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6470690:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bertie the Bus Water Squirter::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::29.08.2008::::    Bertie as your young child will know is a bus, a red bus with a friendly face. Bertie is a character from The Railway Series a set of story books for children about a fictional railway which were written by Rev. W. Awdry. The red Bertie bus toy that I am going to talk about is a bath squirter a soft rubbery toy that fills with water and then your devilish child will squirt at you. This toy is made by Tomy. Bertie bus looks identical to the drawings of Bertie in the book from Thomas tank engine again written in 1949, Bertie does appear in other books too helping his train friends.  Bertie is about 14cm long. When Bertie is submerged in water squeeze him to get all the air out Bertie will fill up with water. This water squirter does give a reasonable squirt of water, but I have used others which are better for squirting water.This toy is recommended for children 18 months and over, but mum and dad will have fun squirting Bertie at baby long before then. . Children will continue to enjoy using this toy until they are quite old.Water play is great fun and educational too so do not confine Bertie to the bath get a  bowl of water for baby /toddler to play with or use Bertie in the paddling pool (clothed adults beware yes you will get wet Bertie will get pointed and squirted at you  ) This toy is available from http://www.tomy.co.uk/products/thomas-bathtime-squirters---bertie/ for    2.99 also    2.99p from http://www.babybathshop.co.uk/. This toy is available at many other shops both on and off line.There are other characters from the book available as a squirter too, Thomas, Percy, James and most of the other engines To go with Bertie bus and the other train characters from Rev W Awdry s books is a Bath island, a floating island with a ramp a tower and a water wheel, this cost around    11.  Kids love playing with water and if you have a bath time hater this toy will probably encourage them to the tub.     ::::5646482:3:::6616219:3:::6616219:3:::6702721:3:::6702721:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719918:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239059:4:::6617495:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6288851:4:::6310942:4:::5633146:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6242691:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719974:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6647513:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6442533:4:::6239669:4:::6660163:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5584168:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6603737:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6690515:4:::6690515:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6668503:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5803721:4:::6609678:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tebay Services Hotel::::Travel::::40::::very helpful::::28.08.2008::::    We have often stopped at Tebay services both north and south heading back from Scotland at Easter we stopped at Tebay south. So this review is about Tebay southboundTebay services are in Cumbria between j38 and j39 of the M6In 1972 Tebay north opened it was not until 1993 that Tebay South bound opened. These service stations are owned by Westmorland Limited a company formed when two local Cumbrian families, the Dunnings and the Birketts joined together. These families were local bakers and Tebay is the only locally owned and run service station. This service station has been very successful winning many awards .In 2006Tebay Services were voted the Best Motorway Services in Britain by  Which Holiday  magazine. I would totally agree with this choice.Tebay north is a fairly attractive low building in a really attractive area overlooked by the hills of the Howgills. There seems to be ample parking. You may just be stopping at Tebay south for fuel for your car, but it is worth stopping there to rest recuperate and eat a snack or a full meal. Tebay south is situated in a grassy are with paths that take you around the building  there is a pond with ducks on this is visible from seating inside the service station.There seemed to be some work in progress developing a children s play area. There are a few facilities outside for children, also some picnic tables.As you might expect in a service station there are cash machines and pay phones. The first place I visited in the services was the ladies. This seemed well cared for clean and respectable.We had arranged to meet up with our daughter and the children there we were traveling in separate cars we arrived within 15 minutes of each other. We headed for the self service  food there was a fairly good choice ,  Sandwiches and cakes were available as well as main meals , I can not remember the full menu but there are satisfying soups roast platters chicken , beef or pork, I seem to remember my husband had a curry . There were sausages too, Cumberland sausages we had a cup of tea, it was fair-trade tea. There was a good selection of desertsWe choose to sit looking out over the pond and the hills we had comfortable chairs and there was a high chair available for our granddaughter. The food area seats about 300 peopleAfter eating we had a quick look in the shop which sold local farm produce cheeses, meats, jams, pickles, biscuits, fresh fruit and veg. This shop is ideal for picking up the a few things to tide you over if you are heading to a self catering holiday .Ideal to for buying that local foodie pressie to take home to the neighbors who are minding the cat.  The farm shop is a winner of the BBC Radio 4 Food and Farming Awards for  Best Local Retailer  2004Thanks for reading my review if you are traveling along the M6 and need a break I would defiantly recommend stopping here. There is a camping site and hotel facilities near here too.

       " '5247778::::Yeo Valley Organic Natural Yoghurt::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::26.08.2008::::    I love yoghurts of all kinds I recently consumed some Yeo valley natural yoghurt.  Yeo make several yoghurts with the name natural in it.   There is the organic natural yoghurt or, fat free natural yoghurt and, a Greek style natural yoghurt Natural describes yoghurt with out any added flavour. Yeo valley natural yoghurts are all live yoghurts.The tastes of natural yoghurts has certainly improved since I was a nipper 40+ years ago then it was a sour taste and you could not buy fruit flavored yoghurtsSo let me tell you about Yeo valley organic natural yoghurt. Yeo valleys natural yoghurt is thick and a creamy texture, the low that one slightly thinner and less creamy. There is that very slightly sour taste to Yeo natural yoghurt. Years ago I could not eat a natural yoghurt without adding fruit or jam now this Yeo valley yoghurt is pleasant to eat without adding any thing else .  However this yoghurt is scrummy with strawberries or raspberries and other fruits, a change from cream or ice cream. I also sometimes make a  riata with Yeo valley natural yoghurt to accompany a curry  just some yoghurt with some chopped mint added for a basic one sometimes I sprinkle some chilli on top add some cucumber maybe some tomato .

       " '5247778::::Mallaig Heritage Dentre::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::25.08.2008::::    Ciao has got it wrong its Mallaig heritage centre  not dentre.  We were holidaying on the west coast of Scotland this half term and visited the Mallaig Heritage centre. We were waiting to catch the Ferry to the islands.The Mallaig heritage centre is a smallish building near the train station.This centre is open from9.30-430 weekdays  July august and September 12am till 4pm at the weekends November till March it is open Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday 12-5pm. April May June and October it is open Monday to Saturday 11am till 4 pm. There was a small admission charge,  I can not remember how much but I think ot was about    2. This centre is a single story building access for disabled visitors seems good,There is an entrance area with a pay desk and a few things for sale, videos, books postcards souvenirs and information sheets both about the displays and the area. Then there was just the one large display room.Family history archives are kept here if you wish to do research then book a visit if possible phone 01678 462085. We had our grandson aged 5 and our 11/2 year old granddaughter with us. There was a children s quiz sheet available free and best of all for our children there was a play area  (unsupervised)This was only a small corner of the room  but to our grandsons delight it had a wooden brio train track , I suppose this related to the railway line just outside . The Harry potter steam engine runs to sadly we missed seeing it at Mallaig but did see the train in fort William just down the lion, There were a few other toys available to play with in this area too cant remember what it was but my granddaughter found something to amuse her for a short time but she was happiest just walking around the room.The displays around the room were interesting when you realize that just over 100 years ago this area was really inaccessible most transport was by boat the mountains so large around this area. There is an information bourd about the railway and how a track was forged to fort William. There are lots of Photos of every day life and photos (some dating back to 1900) of the mountains and the sea. There is information about fishing industry in Mallaig . Stories and information about the Mallaig lifeboat brave men going out to save those that needed rescuing at sea. There was an information board telling how hundreds of people were evicted from their homes on Knoydart and forced to Emigrate to Canada. In another corner of the room there is a video set up, it gives a tour of the west highland landscape. This was an interesting visit the displays and information well set out took us about 30 minutes to look around. It could have taken a little longer but we had the children with us The address and web address of this centre is :-Mallaig Heritage Centre Station Road, Mallaig, Highland PH41 4PY - Scotland, UKPhone: +44 (0)1687 462085  -  Fax: +44 (0)1687 462085http://www.mallaigheritage.org.uk/     ::::6616219:3:::6616219:3:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6239059:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6668942:4:::6668942:4:::6288851:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6242691:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::5584168:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6378505:4:::5719918:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5961041:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5921889:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6601458:4:::6601458:4:::6609678:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5805660:4:::6184293:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Smooth Set Lemon Yoghurt::::Food & Drink::::30::::very helpful::::21.08.2008::::    I usually take a yoghurt to work for my lunch  At the end of term I took Tesco French set yoghurts These yoghurts come in a pack of 6 125g  plastic pots  costing 98pso these are quite good value  Flavours in the pack of 6 included peach, cherry, raspberry. Strawberry, lemon, apricot and vanilla. These yoghurts come in 125g plastic pots covered in an orange paper label usual written info on the wrapper plus a picture of the fruit. The use by date is stamped on the lid I check that the pack I buy has a date later than Fridays . I took the lemon one to work last Tuesday and after I had settled the children in the dining room I went to the staff room to eat my lunch and have a cup of tea. I do not do dinner duties I am on playground duty and staff at my school do not get free lunches , there is no availability to buy them either. It s a bit of a rush to eat my lunch as Although we get     an hour By the time I get upstairs I usually only get 20 -25 minutes. Ok so I ate my ham sandwich then I peeled back the foil lid of my lemon French set yoghurt. The yoghurt is a pale very pale lemon colour doesn t really smell of much, it had a small amount of what looked like clear oil on top of it; I guess some ingredients had begun to separate. I dug my spoon in the yoghurt. I tasted my first mouthful; it was ok a mild lemon flavour, quite fresh and the texture, sort of jelly like.  Not curds like other yoghurt. This yoghurt was ok I think the lemon flavour is one of my favorites in this French set yoghurt selection. This yoghurt was not special but then it was only for a rushed lunch at work as by the time I had eaten my sandwich and the yoghurt, drunk my tea exchanged one or two pleasantries with a co worker then been to the loo it was time to go outside with the little darlings.  I think I actually prefer non set yoghurts to the French set ones. I do recycle my school yoghurt pots sometimes washing them up to use for glue or paint pots.These yoghurts contain 125kcal per pot, 16.8g sugar, and 4.1g fat.Overall I was not ecstatic about the lemon set yoghurt I have had better they are not super low fat and sugar ones so doubt if I will rush out to buy more when I have finished these , . They are ok but that s all     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6400153:3:::6400153:3:::5719918:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6239059:4:::6694578:4:::6694578:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6288851:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::21963:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6242691:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6671773:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5690767:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5584168:4:::5646482:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6617478:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6609678:4:::6665290:4:::6603737:4:::6647513:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5837391:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5719974:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5961041:4:::6647705:4:::6647705:4:::6683044:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Argos Chrome Plated Toilet Brush::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::20.08.2008::::    When we refurbished our bathroom I bought this chrome plated toilet brush and toilet roll holder. I wanted a slim silvery coloured toilet brush holder to match the silver trims on the shower and the bathroom cabinet. When I spotted this one I was pleased, this set only costs    9.97p. Similar ones are available at slightly higher prices.  This set consists of a base into which fits a stainless steel arc which has a toilet roll holder into the base fits the silvery container to keep the toilet brush in. This is a freestanding item.  Now when I got home I decided we did not want the toilet roll holder bit I had a pine one which fixed to the wall I liked the pine one better. However the chrome plated toilet brush and canister was just perfect, fitted the space just right. It s a simple design a chrome silvery canister with a lid onto which fits a toilet brush. .The toilet brush is quite small I am not sure that a standard replacement brush would fit into the canister. The brush is east to hold and use to clean the toilet bowl. We have had this now for a couple of years it still seems to be good just needs a wash now and then, looks nicer than a grotty plastic one. This toilet brush and canister looks quite elegant sat behind my throne.     ::::5719918:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::6242691:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5646482:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::6690494:3:::6690494:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5439461:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6461332:3:::6456238:3:::6456238:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239059:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::6288851:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::21963:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5719974:4:::6603737:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6660163:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6683845:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6416706:4:::6416706:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6609678:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6647705:4:::6647705:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Carnations & Pinks::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::18.08.2008::::    My pinks in the garden are nearly finished a few flowers hanging on.  Pinks and carnations flower in the garden June, July and August. These flowers are a sweet smelling addition to the flower border. There are many variants of the pink and carnation family dianthus.  You may be most familiar with these flowers for button holes and bouquets. The ones for button holes the perennial Perpetual Carnation have probably been grown in a greenhouse.Carnations are flowers that are often given as a symbol of love the darker flowers representing a truer deeper emotion. The first carnations in England were introduced from Normandy in 1100. The older varieties are highly scented as they have been bred for different colours and larger flowers the scent has been bred out of a lot of them and some of the modern species do not smell so strongly. The flowers have a wide range of different shades of pink and scarlet and whites, sometimes white carnations are dyed different colours for a special colour scheme at an event. Carnations can be one coloured or a flower with a different shade around the edge or the centre of the flower.The carnations I grow in my flower border are a hardy perennial carnation.  They grow fairly well on most soils they like a fairly well drained soil mine is chalk , but saying that my dad grew them successfully on clay.These flowers can be grown from seed but do well grown from cuttings; I shall attempt to take cuttings from my plants.  These flowers look pretty and smell wonderful edging or at the back of a border on a hot sunny summers evening.You can buy a carnation plant for a few pounds or a bunch of carnation from about    4.00 upwards  depending where from and how many .Carnations are the national flower of Spain it is the birth flower for those in January.

       " '5247778::::Glo-white::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::17.08.2008::::    It s the school holidays a time I use to do all those little tasks I never get time to do in term time.One of those jobs is washing the net curtains. Yes I have nets I do not really like nets. However I have a glass front door and windows either side of it this is at the base of the stairs. Now I usually sleep in just my skin and occasionally nip downstairs with nothing on, either that or a dressing gown. So that I do not frighten the postman and embarrass myself I have put nets up at the front door windows. Would like to get blinds one day but after they cost more and I have now got used to the nets.Now my nets do get a bit dirty as they get all the dust and grime     coming in the front door. I do not need to wash them very often and I noticed I still have some glo white in my cleaning cupboard so I shall use that. My glo white still is in that old pack with the picture of a smiling woman pulling back her net curtains. Glo white now comes in a different package it s a white package with green writing with a picture of a hand reaching out to touch a glowing white net curtain Dr Beckham glo whiteNow I checked the price on the acadoco web sitehttp://www.acdomart.co.uk and it costs    2.49 this is for a pack weighing 0.2 kg it contains three individual 50 ml packs. There is enough powder in each sachet for about 6 standard nets so more than enough for my door net and the two windows.The instructions on the packet are easy to follow just wash your nets by hand. Then dissolve one pack of powder in less than 4 pints of water and leave the nets soaking for 5 minutes. Remove and hang them straight on the washing line let them drip dry, does not take long You may get away with out ironing the curtains. You could wash on a delicate wash in your machine putting glo white in the final rinse switching the machine off and letting them soak for 5 minutes or so. Before spinning .They dry quicker this way just iron them and hang them up at the window damp they will dry fairly quickly. It really is quick and I can hang these up over my front door and windows to protect my modesty if I should forget to put my clothes on when coming downstairsGlo white does a good job of making nets clean; it smells fresh quite a pleasant smell.

       " '5247778::::Traditional Chrome Taps::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::15.08.2008::::    I was discussing taps with my daughter a month or two ago as she was having a new bathroom fitted. A few years ago now we had new taps fitted and I investigated all types of tap trying to get the perfect tap .We looked at the various kinds of taps, their ease of use their looks their price. I remember talking about traditional  chrome taps with her. Chrome taps are a good choice as they go with most bathroom and sink colour choices they are the standard silver colour.Traditional taps are the ones with a cross top handle that you twist to turn the water on.  You can buy mixer traditional style taps but I prefer individual hot and cold taps They will have an H or a C printed in the centre of the cross handle.There are many tap designs nowadays so I do not think these traditional cross top ones are really that popular.Personally I like the look of traditional taps , I suppose that s because when I was a child in the late 50 s early 60 s few other  tap designs were around and  because I grew up with them when I think of a tap this type is the image that comes into my mind .I have tried to think of advantages to having traditional twist taps over other taps and I can not find any other than the fact I think they look better. They may not match a more modern sleeker bathroom or kitchen. They are more difficult to turn, a problem with older people and those with arthritis. I think they are more difficult for younger children to turn off completely too. So I am generally negative about their use. Both my daughter and I decided to go for a slightly more modern design.Fitting these taps well if you can do a bit of DIY should not be too difficult. I found instructions at http://www.focusdiy.co.uk/page/diy15Traditional chrome taps are made by many manufacturer and are available at B   Q for about    40 a pair    20 in present sale. At http://www.victorianplumbing.co.uk the almost identical ones to those in the picture are    21.95. Just looked at http://www.taps4less.com/Traditional-Taps.html and found quite a good selection  from    35 a pair.So generally these chrome traditional taps are not as expensive as some other designs of tap. Thanks for reading if you are debating which type of taps to buy I hope I helped you  make a decision     ::::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5719918:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6239059:4:::6288851:4:::21963:4:::6242691:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6628390:4:::6689946:4:::6689946:4:::5333607:4:::5333607:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5633146:4:::6692844:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6391216:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6603737:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::6431958:4:::6431958:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::5366599:4:::5366599:4:::6675330:4:::6675330:4:::6190414:4:::6609678:4:::5719974:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::6665290:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6378505:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::6474927:4:::6690494:4:::6690494:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre TP Explorer Den::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::11.08.2008::::    My daughter bought a climbing frame for the children last summer and bought a climbing frame tent to go with it. We visited my daughter last week and wondered where my grandson aged 5 was. Adrian is sulking my daughter said he couldn t get his own way. Where is he then ? In the climbing frame tent that s his favorite sulking place.This climbing frame tent makes a good place to hide from the world. Your child can climb their climbing frame then pretend they are in their tree house.  There is a platform for this tent so your child can sit inside it. This tent fits on top of a TP climbing frame and gives an extra dimension to climbing activities. The fabric this tent is made of is waterproof. It is a tough rip stop nylon type material like a tent is made of, quite thick and strong. There are 2 roll up doors which can be fixed at the top.  These are useful as you can fit ladders /bridges to the climbing frame through these doors .There is one oval transparent window.This tent is not very easy to fit the climbing frame has to be dismantled to fit it. The tent has a seam at the bottom of it. This threads through the rungs of the bars of the climbing frame at the same level as the platform. This may be fiddly time consuming if you keep taking the den/tent on and off but my grandkids just leave their tent on all the time. You can buy this TP explorer den from the ELC, http://www.elc.co.uk/toy-30339?scid=awin for    55 it is also available at many other online stores most seem to be around the    55 mark.Yes I would recommend this toy it adds an extra dimension to play on the climbing frame. A special den to play /hide in can be Tarzans lookout; the eagles nest anything that your child imagines. .  Get those kids fit climbing frames and outdoor play are fun.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::21963:3:::6603737:3:::5646482:3:::6616219:3:::6616219:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5719918:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6239059:4:::6242691:4:::6288851:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5633146:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6671773:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6647513:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6695308:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5620008:4:::5719974:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5347743:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6456362:4:::5085480:4:::5085480:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6412105:4:::6412105:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5816422:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6474927:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6609678:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6665290:4:::6647517:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5565371:4:::5565371:4:::6691901:4:::6691901:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego 9v Train Tracks: Curved Rails for 9v Trains::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.07.2008::::    My grandson now ages 5     has moved on to playing with small Lego. He loves trains, has spent many happy hours playing with both brio and duplo trains. He is not quite old enough for Hornby oo model trains he would love to play with granddads model trains but they would soon get destroyed. So for his 5th birthday we have started to build a Lego electric 5v train set buying him a train and some rail enough to make a small circuit.Amongst the items we bought was a pack of curved rails. This pack includes 8 pieces of track and costs    11.99 from http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=4520. These curves are 5 inches long and will make half a circle when joined together. . Each piece has 5 sleepers between the rails  and are 5 inches long.The tracks will conduct electricity to allow the 9v Lego trains to run. These tracks are compatible for the newer Lego RC trains.These train tracks are fairly easy to put together the rails just slide together and clip in place. To undo the tracks will just slide away from each other when pulled lightly.They are fairly robust would not enjoy rough treatment but should survive many standard play hours.The trains run smoothly on these tracks when they are fitted together with other pieces of tracks.Curves are really a good addition to Lego 9v train sets. These curves will allow circuits behind granddads chair, around the coffee table legs taking the passengers on the train for adventures around nanas sitting room. At home the train runs on the bedroom carpet under the bed round these curves back under the bed and completes its circuit by the toy box.  Adrian enjoys this Lego train and the curves make the track more versatile. His sister aged 2 would love to get to these tracks and the train but Adrian forbids her as she is too young and only messes up his carefully laid circuits .Yes I would recommend these Lego curved tracks for anyone who is thinking of getting Lego 5v trains.Lego trains and track are available on line and in many toy shops. I would recommend these train track curves Lego trains are good play value     ::::5522492:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6239059:4:::21963:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5921889:4:::6190414:4:::6647513:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5633146:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6288851:4:::6242691:4:::22279:4:::22279:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6653586:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5646482:4:::5584168:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6310942:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::5719918:4:::5961041:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5719974:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6665290:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Branston small chunk pickle::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::20.07.2008::::    I do like some pickle with my cheese and one of my favorite pickles is Branston pickle. I recently bought a Branston pickle small chunk.I think Branston pickle is the best known pickle there is. Crosse and Blackwell first produced this pickle in 1922 in Branston. Branston which is a suburb of Stoke on Trent once a small village but now merged into Stoke.Branston is now produced in Bury ST Edmunds.The taste of Branston is the same as it was then as the recipe has not changed.Branston pickle is a sweet pickle, hubby says it s too sweet for him; it tastes fruity with a spicy tang. Branston pickle contains onions, Swede, cauliflower gherkins tomato apple and dates. Spices are  mustard, coriander, garlic, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, nutmeg and cayenne pepper.The standard Branston pickle has big chunks of diced vegetables. But they now make a small chunk variety. This is basically the same pickle just that the pieces of vegetable are in smaller chunks they have been through a finer chopper. I think this is a good form of Branston pickle as although you still get a crisp bite of vegetable the pieces are smaller so do not fall of your fork /sandwich so easily . This is a better form of pickle for spreading in a sandwich.The small chunk pickle is the same dark brown colour and has the same sweet spicy smell as the large chunk varietyThis fine chunk pickle is much easier to put in a cheese and pickle sandwich that you are taking to work.I like this pickle with a good piece of cheddar cheese and a chunk of good bread. When you order a ploughman s lunch at the pub usually the pickle is Branston.Branston pickle also goes well with cold meats I just had a memory of post Christmas turkey served up by my mum with salad and some Branston. This pickle is also good at a barbeque; sausage with branston poickle is fantastic There are several other sweet pickles available, but none quite the same as BranstonAs well as a glass jar Branston put this small chunk pickle in to a squeezy container this is easy for picnics or BBQ sBranston small chunk pickle can be bought at most supermarkets the price at Tesco s is    1.09 for a 520g jar,    1.03p for a squeezy container with 410g in it, also available in a 310 size but I can not find the price.In 100g of pickle there are 109 calories, 26 g carbohydrate, .2g fat, 1.1g fibre, 1.6g sodium. So if you spice up your food with only a little of this it s not tooo bad for calories.     ::::5646482:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5584168:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6448877:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239059:4:::6561127:4:::6561127:4:::21963:4:::6696624:4:::6696624:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5416378:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6242691:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5633146:4:::6647513:4:::6288851:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5620008:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5719918:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5719974:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6378906:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6559918:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6609678:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6310942:4:::6628390:4:::5690767:4:::6665290:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6562051:5:::6562051:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Cadbury Crunchie ice cream bars::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::16.07.2008::::    A Crunchie bar ice cream. Lets hope we are in for a long hot summer, if we are we will be buying and consuming lots of ice creams. Looking into the freezer in the shop how do we decide which ones to purchase?I peer into the supermarket freezer and put a box of Crunchie ice cream bars into my trolley .These ice creams cost me    1.50 for a pack of 4. They can be bought at many supermarkets.These rectangular bars each containing 60ml of ice cream are individually wrapped in a golden plastic foil wrapper.I open one and the rectangular bar is completely covered in a thin covering of chocolate this chocolate is that delicious Cadbury chocolate. Taking a bite I taste the ice cream a honeycomb flavour almost caramel. In the ice cream there is a scattering of small honeycombed pieces similar to the honeycomb inside a crunchy. When you bite you do not get that crunch. The honeycomb pieces are not always hard sometimes a bit soft and chewy.This ice cream bar tastes good it has the reminiscence of that Crunchie bar the chocolate covering and the honeycomb flavour in the ice-cream.There are 155 kcalories in each ice cream and obviously not suitable for a dairy free diet . Crunchie ice cream bars are a Cadbury product the first Crunchie bar produced by Fry s in 1929 Fry s bought out by Cadbury in the 1980 s. I like these ice creams I expect to be buying more this summer.;     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::21963:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5025435:3:::5025435:3:::5646482:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::6603737:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6609542:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5719918:3:::5633987:3:::5633987:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6639882:3:::6639882:3:::6609678:3:::5366599:3:::5366599:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5816422:3:::6448877:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6665290:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6651411:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::6660163:4:::6645904:4:::6645904:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6310942:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6666469:4:::6666469:4:::6613988:4:::6669524:4:::6669524:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Fritillaries::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::14.07.2008::::    If you have read my previous reviews you will know I like to garden organically and grow native species and to encourage wildlife mostly butterflies to my garden. I like to grow English native plants in my garden There are several fritillaries one that is native to England is the fritllarea meleagris the snakes head fritillary. This plant is from the family Liliaceae. The pattern texture of this flower reminds one of snakeskin, hence its name. Also called   guinea-hen flower due to its color also called checked lily. This plant grows up to 30 cm 12 inches tall. The flower is bell lantern shaped and hangs down on a single stem. The flower is pretty it is a checkered pattern of pink and purples. When I see one I just have to get down and examine its delicate flower. There is also a white variety which is also has a lightly checked patterned. The flower bell is about 4cm largeNaturally in the wild this flower grows in damp meadows. It is not such a common wild flower as it used to be but grows well in many gardens. This plant looks lovely naturalized in the garden in the grass. But do not cut the grass till the fritillary leaves have died down; this plant grows well under shrubs too. It likes a soil that is damp but drains well that does not become waterloggedYou can buy seeds to grow this flower from http://seeds.thompson-morgan.com/uk/en/product/8162/1 they cost    3.99 for a packet containing 30 seeds. SEW these se3ds autumn through to springAt http://www.secretseeds.com/acatalog/Fritillaria.htmlFritillaria meleagris (Snake s Head Fritillary) you can buy a pack of 50 seeds for    1.80these will flower year after year in the same position and will self seed increasing the numbers.There are other members of the fritillarea species that you can grow n your garden larger taller flowers, but I like this smaller delicate fritllarea meleagris the snakes head fritillary. To see pictures of other fritillaries look at http://search.live.com/images/results.aspx?q=fritillaria++flower mkt=en-gb.

       " '5247778::::Inverlochy Castle, Fort William::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::15.07.2008::::    We stayed on the west coast of Scotland for our holidays and had to go into the nearest big town Fort William. After spending the morning there we headed out along the A 82 to wards Inverness After only about a mile there is a small sign and a turn to Inverlochy castle. A map can be found at. http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=212500 y=775500 z=3 sv=212500,77550 0 st=4 ar=N mapp=newmap.srf searchp=newsearch.srf.  The castle is on the edge of the town in a semi industrial area.  After we too the turn we note a car park in front of us we decide not to take it, but turned right over a wooden bridge where we found free parking in another car park. The castle was situated between the two. It seems quite tranquil around the immediate castle areWe had taken a packed lunch with us to eat at the castle so we strolled to the castle the castle is in a small area of parkland. Entrance to the castle was free. This castle although a ruin is quite completes the lower walls and towers still a fairly solid construction. There are no tea rooms no tourist shop, just the crumbing stone walls.We walked into the castle through where the door must have once been. There is no longer a moat around the castle .This castle was a small castle. This castle was built as a square courtyard and has 4 round towers in the corners. The height of the castle is about 10 metres/30 foot high not as high as it was originally. . The children loved this castle and the adults interested to see the construction. We all went into the corner towers some of them had the remains of a couple of steps going upwards but we told the children not to climb. The courtyard was grassed. We chose a corner to sit in and eat our packed lunch. It was a lovely place for r a picnic restful and atmospheric. After lunch we went out of the entrance at the back of the castle this led down to the river Lochy a few trees and a grassy bank by the side of the river we could have eaten our lunch there, but with the little ones we preferred not to sit near the river. A footpath led booth ways along side of the river we walked a short distance and I would have liked to have walked further but we had other plans for the afternoon.I am glad we stopped at the castle to have our picnic we were there for about 1     hours saw only 6 other visitors who strolled through.If you are in this area do stop and have a look there is not a great deal to see you could explore it within     an hour or prolong your visit with a picnic or a walk along the river. by the way the picture on the product page top is not the castle I have added a few of my pictures     ::::5522492:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::6665290:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5333607:3:::5333607:3:::5584168:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5633987:3:::5633987:3:::6613988:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5816422:3:::6696245:4:::21963:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6242691:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6288851:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6609542:4:::5719918:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5961041:4:::6298557:4:::6298557:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6378505:4:::5633146:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5719974:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6628390:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::10968:4:::10968:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6642740:4:::6642740:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I have played with both the pink and the blue Tomy water whistler. Not in my bath but in the school swimming pool. I work with special needs children and at the end of our swimming session we have a play time with a variety of water toys.I and my students have great fun playing with this toy. It is suitable for children aged 18 months and overThe Dolphin is about 14cm tall a soft hollow rubber / plastic toy.  This dolphin comes in pink or blue. It has big black eyes an open smiling mouth and sports a bow tie. This dolphin looks friendly.This dolphin floats; he also whistles there is a white plastic grid, whistle hole at the base of the dolphin. Watch out this dolphin also squirts water when squeezed; a good jet of water can be squirted out of dolphins mouth when the dolphin is squeezed. These dolphins are reasonable strong to withstand play but the ones in our pool have lost the white grid/ holes that helps performs the whistle and squirt. They have been played with squirted squeezed many many times. However these toys are still played with.This toy costs    3.99p RRP but you can buy it for    3.95 at http://www.everythingplay.com/product/4422.html?id=4422 or its cheaper    2.99 from http://www.sgstradinguk.com/tomy-water-whistler-dolphin-pink-p-606.html.

       " '5247778::::Hazel::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::10.07.2008::::    Hazel, after writing about pussy willow I really had to write about Hazel.The Hazel species of tree s are one I really like. The hazel (Corylus avellana) is a member of the Birch tree family Betulaceae .  There are at least 15 Hazel species. It grows in Britain and throughout Europe also Russia, morocco, Algeria, Turkey, and Iran .The Hazel tree is very common in Scotland.The reason I love the hazel is because of its catkins in February. These adorn the branches before its leaves and leaves of many other trees too. A twig with catkins on looks lovely in a flower arrangement with daffodils, a real spring decoration.The Hazel tree grows to 10 meters, but on a lot of land it does not reach that height. Hazel trees can often be thought as more of a bush than a tree .Hazel will grow in the hedgerow in copses and under oak trees it does like a damp but well drained soil.Hazel; has lots of branches that come out almost straight from the ground and the tree has a spreading appearance. Hazel is often coppiced and new stems replace the old coppiced stems. The hazel tree is deciduous has a rounded leaf which are toothed and the underside slightly hairy.The catkins sometimes known as lamb s tails are the male flowers they are a yellow green the female flowers are little red tufts on the same branch as the male flowers. Although not a nut lover I have collected hazel nits for the nut lover in the family. The nut is mature in the autumn.The hazel is a really useful tree.  The hazel makes a good hedge if coppiced. The coppiced wood is used to make fences, for thatching, for basket making and many other uses that need a pliable wood.  The hazel is a good wildlife habitat giving a hiding place to animals and many insects will eat the leaves, beetles and moth larvae. The willow tree also is good for lichens and fungus growing on it.Then there is the nut, nuts hazel nuts. We love to cover them in chocolate and eat them. But also the squirrels, wood mice, dormouse and many other animals love to eat them too. Birds like to feast on these nuts too.The Hazel has a magic quality too. A  Y shape of hazel is used as a dowsing rod to divine water. Hazel nuts strung together are a good luck charm. The Hazel tree is the wisdom tree carry a hazel nut with you and you will be wise and make wise choices.  Hazel does have several other magical qualities to but I can not believe wearing a cap made of willow branches will make your thoughts come true, can you?     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5186837:3:::6598259:3:::6598259:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5439461:3:::6613988:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5646482:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6288851:4:::5620008:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6653586:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6616219:4:::6616219:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6370654:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5719974:4:::6242691:4:::5961041:4:::5690767:4:::5335750:4:::6310942:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6603737:4:::6647513:4:::6220511:4:::6220511:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5816422:4:::6521661:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Asda Chocolate Filled Puffins::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::09.07.2008::::    After being satisfied with the mint and orange puffins in Asda I bought some chocolate puffins when I next visited. The chocolate puffins are wrapped in a blue package have the word asda puffin on the front and pictures of the biscuit. Mint and orange flavored puffins are available tooSize and calories~~~~~~~These biscuits come in packets containing 8 individually wrapped biscuits. 8, 25g chocolate covered biscuits for 61 p are quite good value 29.9 p per 100g .These biscuits contain 530kcal per 100g so about 132 kcal per biscuit. So do not eat too many as you will increase in sizeif you eat lots of calories.I ate one of these biscuits and found it was completely covered in a fairly thin covering of chocolate; it is a good tasty milk chocolate .The biscuit is a chocolate biscuit sandwiched like a bourbon biscuit. The filling is a chocolate tasting cream filling. This biscuit does taste deliciously chocolaty. It was a good sweet biscuit snack at a very good price. I shall certainly be buying these again if I want an individually wrapped chocolate biscuit.These biscuits are an ideal size for taking in a packed lunch to school, to work or on a picnic. They are a cheap biscuit at about 8p each. Penguins do not like puffins~~~~~~~~~~~~In 1997 there was a court case by Penguin who claimed there were too many similarities between Puffin and Penguin. I believe there was a cartoon Puffin on the Puffin biscuits which has now disappeared. For details of this case see http://www.iprights.com/cms/templates/articles.asp x?articleid=60 zoneid=2.I think it s just a case of sour grapes as Mc Vities know these cheaper biscuits are considered to be better than Penguin biscuits by some people. I think that these puffin biscuits taste as good if not better than penguin biscuits     ::::5522492:3:::6688743:3:::6688743:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::21963:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6288851:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6242691:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6614632:4:::6665290:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5261772:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6630539:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5719918:4:::6370654:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6609678:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::5719974:4:::5961041:4:::6613988:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::ELC Big Busy Bee::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::06.07.2008::::    I want to tell you all about Busy bee. This is a toy from the ELC it costs    20.00, now you may think that s a lot of money but I think this toy is worth it. Why? Do I think I hear you say?  Well let me tell you about this Busy bee. Busy bee is a large soft sensory toy. Busy bee is bright and colorful. Bee has a lovely bright yellow head .A smiley mouth and two black eyes , a red pom, pom, nose these make Busy bee look happy and friendly.  There are two green antennae from the head each ending with a flowerHer head (busy bee looks feminine to me so I will call it her) as I was saying her head is attached to her body.  Her body is yellow with orange stripes .Attached to busy bees tummy by a short pull string is baby bee. Baby bee vibrates as it buzzes its way back to mummy s tummy after the string has been pulled. Busy bee has two orange arms which are at the top end of her body The  hands  have 3  fingers  the fingers have a blue patch to squeeze these make a sound On the back of her body two wings are attached these are made of On the back of her body there are two wings these are made of a crinkly fabric they have a crinkly feel and sound when crushed.At the lower part of the body two  short orange legs and green feet the base of her feet are tactile, one has a mirror on it the other stripy fabric.  Busy bee is made of a lovely soft fabric she is soft and squeezable. Busy bee is suitable for babies upwards to about 1 year old, but of course it All depends on your Childs development. We have one at the special needs school I work at.Baby thinks Busy bee is good to feel, (soft bits schruchy crinkly bits) to grasp, to stuff in his/her mouth. Good to listen to. (There s a squeaker and a rattle a scrunching sound too)Busy bee is good to look at too bright attractive colours and a reflective mirror. . I think most babies will be attracted to this toy and enjoy discovering and exploring the sensory areas.I think this could make a good birth present.

       " '5247778::::Cork Woods of Andalucia, Spain::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::02.07.2008::::    At Easter we holidayed in Andalucia inland not on the coast.  We had a hired car and did drive a bit and we also went for walks. Andalusia s mountainous and some of the area still had snow in Early April. Where ever we were it was not far away from a cork oak tree .A lot of Andalucia has man managed cork oak forests. These forests were quite dense not much light getting through the canopy. These woods not as dark as pine forest thoughThe cork forests we went into seemed to be well managed and some have Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, which recognizes that their forests are managed to the highest international social and environmental standards.The cork oak tree quercus suber is a deciduous tree the leaves lobed and it produces acorns. An individual oak grows 9=12 meters tall. A cork tree can live to about 200 years. It was interesting to see trees with bands of bark cut from all around the tree. We noticed many trees with bands of cork cut.  We also saw trees with a small square cut in the bark , I guess this was a tester area to check the thickness of the bark.  In one are we saw rolls of the cork bark lying on the floor awaiting collection.Apparently the cork can be harvested like this every 9 years. It does not harm the tree and the tree regroups more bark.We did not see this but apparently pigs are turned out into the forests in the autumn and they eat the acorns. Wild pigs can also be found here.These woods are good for birds providing nesting areas The Park Nacional de donate especially good. Then there s the Acornocales Natural Park, as you can guess from the name it s called after the acorn .Another natural park area I have visited is the Sierra de GrazalemaIf you wish to know what flora and fauna there is in these parks go to http://www.andalusia-web.com/natureparks_details.htm there are descriptions of the parks and lists of birds there better than I could provide. This area of cork woods is inland of Malaga and Granada so if you are visiting the coastal areas of Spain and wish to go inland for a day it is well worth it. Before we go on holiday we always investigate by looking for good websites one is  http://jellymail.net/Andalucia 20Wildlife.htm  Then there s http://www.slowtrav.com/gmaps/viewmaptext.asp?map=15 . There is a fair map of the area at http://www.slowtrav.com/gmaps/viewmaptext.asp?map=15There is some concerns that because plastic corks and stoppers are now being used for wine that the cork forests will not become necessary so they will diminish in number as they will not be a good cash crop. However we use cork in many other ways too. Cork flooring tiles, cork trays coasters and the goods old dart board, cork has also many applications in industry. Thank you for reading my review the first time I saw these trees I was fascinated as I had not really thought about where cork s from wine bottles came from.     ::::6461332:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6694578:4:::6694578:4:::5522492:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::21963:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5714912:4:::5633146:4:::5255134:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5646482:4:::6242691:4:::5719918:4:::5584168:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5371022:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6660163:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6666469:4:::6666469:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6609678:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5719974:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6220051:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5439461:4:::5961041:4:::6665290:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6378505:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

This settlement is on the coast.This year we stayed in Arisaig in a flat. We revisited The back of Keppoch where we have stayed several times in previous years.  Take the b8008 out of Arisaig or if you are traveling on the newer A830 just after Arisaig there is a left hand turn onto the b8008. Take this road and on the left hand side you will see the Croc-na-faire a pub/hotel .The croc na faire has bed and breakfast facilities see http://www.cnoc-na-faire.co.uk. This hotel is just before a junction on the b8008 with a small road that leads down to the settlement of the back of Keppoch. This small road getting narrower leads to  the end of the track at Gortenachullish When we stayed at the back of Keppoch years ago we stayed in a caravan. (It s no longer there storm damage one year and the people who owned it were fairly old so I imagine they did not replace it)However there are 2 or three places with static vans and some camping facilities too. See http://www.scottishcampingguide.com/link.php?n=71 c= or http://www.iknow-scotland.co.uk/accommodation/17435-kinlois_holiday_cottage s-arisaig.htm. There is not a great deal to write about the settlement at the back of Keppoch   a few houses fishermen s/farming cottages a fairly rough road. WONDERFULL beaches, coves, rock pools, wildlife. This stretch of coast has changed little since we visited last 15 years ago.    It is the beginning of the silver sands of Morar The stretch from the back of Keppock through the bay of Morar us so incredibly beautiful it has been used for many calendars and film shots  notably for the beach scenes in  the classic film  Local Hero . The sea here is used by locals and visitors for canoeing and Sea kayaking more details at http://www.uk.sleeping-out.com/member_details-MemberID-218.html where the Ach na skis croft has a good page.There is an astounding amount of wildlife in this are sea bird watching from the back of Kappoch is good and seals and dolphins can be spotted of the west coast of Scotland. . We found shrimp like little fish in our pools and in previous year I have found sea slugs and there is good amount of shell fish. Inland of course you will see deer and other Scottish mammals.Well we went to one of the beaches just by the back of Keppoch we parked our car by the side of the road. We walked straight onto the beach. We visited this spot twice this holiday once to explore the second time to have a Barbie with our disposable barbeque one evening. We found a sandy beach in a rocky cove when I say sandy   let me describe it. The sand is a pale yellow almost white and it is not a fine sand it is grainy when you look at the sand sieving through your hands you realize it is 10000000000 s of broken seashell particles. Digging a hole in the sand quite deep to make a sand castle   it is amazing how many of these shell/sand particles there are.  We found several whole shells too. It is possible to mold the sand to make castles I had a happy hour or 2 playing making castles and digging holes with my grandchildren digging channels to the sea watching castles and ponds getting reclaimed by the sea. This beach is ideal for children. The sea goes out a long way it is safe to paddle in. Do watch your children though. Although not many other people on the beach I did see people swimming and a few canoes were being used. There are several small islets along this area some you can walk across to when the sea is outWe made sand castles river ways and splashed in the sea then the sun began to go down we had a fantastic barbeque sausages and beef burgers. We were happy children getting tired but still not wanting to stop digging and playing however after much complaining and promising to return my daughter took the children back to our flat as it was getting late. My hubby and I cleared the barbeque away leaving no litter. Just the sand castles and holes which we knew the sea would reclaim. Then hubby staying later had a view of the sun setting over the sea it was wonderful red sky sun going down over the islands of Eigg and Rhum. The redness reflected in the sea. Reluctantly we got back in the car and went to our flat. I nearly had a temper tantrum like my grandson did about leaving this special beach. I feel a longing to return. Hopefully we will one day.Just one thing do remember your anti midge cream as  there are lots of midges . We were lucky with the weather too  often it is not so sunny.;     ::::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5522492:4:::6695753:4:::6695753:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::21963:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5620008:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5633146:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6242691:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6288851:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6647513:4:::5719918:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5646482:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6647517:4:::6660163:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6539421:4:::6539421:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::5439461:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5719974:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6378505:4:::6457531:4:::6457531:4:::6470690:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6665290:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::6673268:4:::6667312:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::10968:4:::10968:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6474927:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Yeo Valley Vanilla Fat Free Yoghurt::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::23.06.2008::::    We have been eating a lot of yoghurt recently partly because my hubby has a digestive problem which yoghurt seems to help. This yoghurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium. It is also Gluten free. In 100g there is 317kj only 0.1g fatOne yoghurt I have bought is Yeo valley organic vanilla fat free yoghurt presently costing    1.53 for a 450g tub on offer two tubs for   2.50. I usually get about 4 servings from a tub more if I am adding it to a desert.This yoghurt is delicious, the taste vanilla like an ice cream mildly but not too sweet, it has no artificial sweeteners. If you want a fairly plain not fruit yoghurt but at the same time do not just want natural yoghurt this is a great flavor. The texture is smooth and creamy fairly thick. Ideal for spooning not thin runny yoghurt but not like a thick double cream.I sometimes eat this yoghurt with my cereal in the morning or use it on a fruit desert I have a lot of rhubarb in the garden which I have been stewing and eating with a good dollop of Yeo valley vanilla yoghurt this is really tasty. Or just add some fruit to this yoghurt raspberries and strawberries are good .Keep this product refrigerated. It is in a large clear plastic pot with a resealable lid . It has a complete covering thin cardboard label. When you wash the pot out and remove the wrapper it makes a good pot not very thick plastic though for storing things in or for children s art projects.Yeo valley yoghurt are good yoghurts. I know of I buy a yeo vallery yoghurt it will be a good one . the buisiness based in Somerset , this year I note they are sponsoring Glastonbury festival.Thanks for reading, enjoy eating yoghurts you know they are good for you .

       " '5247778::::Wendover Woods, Aston Clinton::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::20.06.2008::::    Wendover woods are a few miles from my home we visit several times in the year. These woods are near the villages of Wendover, Halton, and Aston Clinton not far from Tring, and Aylesbury, OS Grid Reference: SP890090.  The woods are on the Chiltern escarpment which overlooks the vale of Aylesbury. See mulitimap        http://www.multimap.com/maps/? map=51.78282,-0.73211|15|4 dp=841 loc=GB:51. 781754331106036:-0.7257551766576576:16. Wendover woods are owned b y the forestry commission and has become a really good outside leisure facility.Wendover woods are open from Dawn till dusk. There are 325 hectares of mixed coniferous and broadleaved woodland.  You can enter the woods by road track and there is a pay and display ticket machine on the right shortly after you enter it cost    2 per car for all day, if you are local you can buy a season ticket    30 for the year. If you enter on foot it s free.There are a couple of car parking areas in the woods. There are many paths through the woods the woods are not all flat though there is quite a lot of hill walking.  Although on a base of chalk there are a few muddy areas after the rains.Wildlife in the woods Wendover woods is a  good place for wildlife  As well as many other woodland species of birds the Firecrest, a bird that is quite rare can be seen here, sometimes the red kite can also be seen flying over.There are Badgers and foxes but you may not see these. There are wood mice and I believe the Edible Dormouse too, you will see grey squirrels and probably muntjac deer.Some butterfly species are seen in the flowery clearings on the south facing banks.Although on chalky soil and with little water there is a pond and smooth and crested newts are here also frogs.There are wild flowers and the display of bluebells in April and May. There are also a few orchid species here too.Wendover woods are a good place to go for wildlife walks, surveys of wildlife and habitat are regularly done and various groups do environmental studies here.  It is a good place for a school to visit to do environmental studies.Fun in the woods Getting fitIf you go down to the woods today you and your family can really go wild.Wendover woods is  a fun place to be if you have children why not let them completely tire themselves out on the play area  there s a swing or two a climbing frame and other  equipment too. It s not just the children who can get fit in the woods there is a fitness trail for adults too.  You could just take a stroll under the trees to the Chiltern s highest point wonderful views over the vale of Aylesbury especially when the trees are not in leaf there are maps available for a marked nature trail. Or you could go orienteering there are 20 orienteering posts, you should not get lost.  Orienteering maps can be purchased from the office during the week, or from the tourist information centre in Wendover. Another way to keep fit is cycling there are cycle tracks marked through the woods my hubby and son in law often cycle from our home up to the woods through them then go on for many miles through the chilterns and do a circular route back homeHorse riding is very popular in the Chilterns and there are trails for riding through these woods.  Food in the woodsMany teddy bears have a picnic in the woods it s a great place for a children s party (weather permitting) go for a walk eat near the play area then play on the swings.If we are going into the woods   we often take a picnic, there are several areas it is good to rest in and eat a picnic.  Why not stop at the woodland cafe after all that getting fit or wildlife watching? I would certainly recommend it. The caf    is situated in the middle of the wood next to the children s play area. I have bought cups of tea there and slice of cake. Sandwiches and other snacks are also available. The caf    will cater for a birthday party too. There are also barbeque pits by the caf    If you are in this area I certainly would recomend a visit for further information see http://www.aylesburyvale.net/visit/tourism/south/info/country/wendover/inde x.htm or http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/Recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/EnglandBuc kinghamshireNoForestWendoverWoods     ::::5522492:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::21963:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6448877:4:::5646482:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6668331:4:::6668331:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::6642740:4:::6642740:4:::6242691:4:::6406069:4:::6406069:4:::5584168:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6660163:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6647513:4:::5961041:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6603737:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6145850:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5719918:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::6609678:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6647517:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Snapdragon (Antirrhinum Majus)::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::18.06.2008::::    Antirrhinum , Snapdragons.I can remember my finger being  bitten  by a snapdragon when I was a child. I would pick a flower, pinch the sides at the base of an individual flower and make the dragons  mouth  open, I would put a finger from the opposite hand in the flower  mouth  and the flower would bite it.The snap dragon is a pretty cottage garden flower you can get standard flowers or a dwarf variety. The standard flowers are about 18 to 24 inches tall the dwarf 10 inches. The snapdragons are plants of the Genus Antirrhinum, in the figwort family Scrophulariaceae. The snap dragon is a Perennial but used as half hardy annual. The seed can be sown in November through till May. They will flower from late spring early summer, also in the late summer early autumn Snap dragons do not like the really hot summer days.The snap dragon plant grows long spikes there are narrow green leaves that grow up the spike then the flowers many individual blooms growing close together making the flower spike. One plant may grow several spikes of flowers. The colours of snap dragon flowers are reds yellow pinks white and orange, most are one colour, some are stripedSnap dragons are not visited by butterflies as the pollen is at the base of the long tubular  mouth  flower, but bees can get in and pollinate the flower. The snapdragon grows well in full sun in a good soil which is well drained .The snapdragon likes to be watered well. If you dead head the flowers they may produce new spikes in the autumn. If you do not dead head the seeds can be collected and sown for flowers the next year. The snap dragon is really a pretty flower to grow in your flower beds.Enjoy your garden this summer Mary.     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5633987:3:::5633987:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5584168:3:::6461332:3:::5646482:3:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::21963:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6448877:4:::5633146:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6288851:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6653586:4:::6242691:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::6647517:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6647513:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6452385:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6184728:4:::6184728:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5840413:4:::5840413:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5719974:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5341620:4:::6669412:4:::6669412:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::6312383:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6412105:4:::6412105:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brasso Metal polish Wadding::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::16.06.2008::::    Clearing out my dads house possesions seems to have brought back many memories for me. When clearing out the cleaning cupboard I found some brasso. My parents had a few brass and copper ornaments which mum would keep shining bright with brasso. I also remember when I was a girl guide I used to get the job of cleaning other peoples metals when it was bob a job week /shilling for the willing.  I sometimes had the silver to clean for that I used Silvo, but for the brass and copper I used Brasso.  If I was lucky it would be the Brasso wadding I would be given not the Brasso liquid, Brasso wadding is so much easier to use.  Brasso Duraglit wadding comes in a 75g tin the labeling distinctive the white name Brasso in the centre of a red circle like the sun from which rays of blue and white radiate. A black lid seals the tin. When you open the lid you can smell that distinctive Brasso smell, its like ammonia it really is a strong smell. You might like to open the windowif you are in an enclosed space . Inside the tin is wadding impregnated with Brasso polish. You may also know this wadding as Duraglit I seem to remember when I was a young thing that these were 2 different products for cleaning but when I just checked the internet Brasso Duraglit is the same product. Now to get to the cleaning. I have a small brass ornament. Take a small piece of wadding out of the tin and rub it all over the brass rubbing firmer where there are marks. The Brasso wadding will leave a black /brown residue on the item so you now need to give it a polish with a clean soft duster. Shine away and your brass will gleam like new. But look at your hands they are black the Brasso has left residue on them. (Nowhere near as bad as when using brasso liquid though.) You will need to wash your hands with soap and water.Brasso really does a good job of cleaning brass , copper, stainless steel and other metals , use Silvo for your silver though its better .Brasso is used not just for cleaning household ornaments. If you are a motorbike owner it will really make the metal gleam also its excellent for cleaning those guitar strings. And if you want a really shiny penny rub it with Brasso and it will gleam like new. Brasso is good for cleaning jewellery and medals to.Iremember cleaning my girl guide promise badge with it in the 1960 sBrasso is mildly abrasive and can be used to remove small scratches on plastics and I have used it to remove a scratch on a wooden coffee table, I imagine it s not suitable for glass though as it may leave a rough frosted effect.  You can buy Brasso /Duraglit wadding at Tescos it costs    1.76 for a 75g tin of wadding.

       " '5247778::::Brio Flying Scotsman Engine::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::14.06.2008::::    Shall we play trains today? I am looking at the Flying Scotsman Made by Brio. Brio has been making wooden toys for a long, long time.  Brio, a Swedish firm now multinational began in 1884 as a basket making company and developed to making wooden toys wooden trains are brilliant toys.  Brios also make prams, cots, high chairs and car seats.The flying Scotsman toy train is a wooden train built to go with the brio wooden train sets.This brio toy is a good reproduction of the Flying Scotsman s engine and tender. This toy is authentically reproduced; details make it like the real train. The flying Scotsman is Green with black details. The engine number and LNER written in gold. Makes me feel all nostalgic for those years of steam. The length of this toy train is 160mm. There are magnets used to attach the train to any other carriages that you wish. This train will run on Brio wooden train tracks, The Tesco wooden train tracks are compatible.There is a flying Scotsman train set with track and railway furniture but I have one that was bought separately. This train will cost about    10 and is available at a lot of toy shops, departments and at Amazon.A little about the real flying Scotsman~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The flying Scotsman real train is usually the first train that springs to mind when you think of steam trains. In the Flying Scotsman built 1923 began running   between London and Edinburgh. In 1934, Flying Scotsman was the first steam train to achieve 100mph (160 kmph)   This train stopped running regular journeys in 1963 when it was bought for preservation. In 2004 Flying Scotsman was bought for the Nation. The National Railway Museum in York houses this locomotive. I think they have been renovating her boiler and she may be steaming again soon. Back to an imaginary worldThe brio flying Scotsman is suitable for a child aged over 3 years old. Brio trains are well made durable so it should last well, it could become an heirloom toy passed onto the next generation. This train will encourage gross and fine motor control. Also stimulate the imagination it is a good toy I know a little boy of 6 who still spends hours playing with his Brio trains he has had since he was 3.Overall a good toy enjoy playing with your children s toys, play alongside and with your children its fun.,     ::::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5522492:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6683044:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6242691:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6452385:4:::21963:4:::5719918:4:::6288851:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5341620:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6667312:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6448877:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5719974:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5961041:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5633146:4:::6378505:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Walkers Shortbread Rounds::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::10.06.2008::::    I settled down to a nice cup of tea after work tonight and with it I had a biscuit, not just any biscuit but a Walkers   shortbread round. Although we have just got back from Scotland where these biscuits originate from, my biscuits were not bought there but left over from Christmas. Wait rose sell these for about    1.50 for the 150g pack. These biscuits are quite a thick round biscuit so not so many in a packet. These biscuits as with all Walkers products are wrapped in a red tartan package looking very distinctive and Scottish. I look at this round biscuit it is an attractive light golden color. The outer of the circle of biscuit is crimped /pleated marks made around it. Then the centre of the circle has little holes pricked into it, this shortbread biscuit looks like a miniature Shortbread petticoat tail (the large circle of shortbread that is cut into wedges to be served).It is a very substantial looking biscuit.Taking a bite from this biscuit it is just right, the texture not too crumbly. The taste is lightly sweet and very wholesome, buttery, it is satisfying and filling. It is not very easy to dunk these biscuits they often crumble into the tea. So I munch my firm biscuit without dipping it into my tea.In my time I have eaten many shortbread biscuits few live up to Walkers in taste and appearance. I really enjoyed my biscuit.Walker s shortbreads are made with out artificial colourings, flavorings or preservatives they are suitable for vegetarians and certified Kosher OU-D. Since these biscuits are made with butter they are obviously not suited to a dairy free diet.Walkers are a Scottish company first started by Joseph Walker in 1898. Walkers Shortbreads can be bought in many countries, they make a good traditional gift. They make shortbread in many shapes and you can now buy shortbreads with chocolate chips in. Walkers also make oatcakes and other cakes too.     ::::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5370902:3:::5370902:3:::6243934:3:::6243934:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5522492:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6614064:3:::6614064:3:::5439461:3:::6609678:3:::6683044:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6101464:4:::6101464:4:::6288851:4:::6023030:4:::6023030:4:::5961041:4:::6234177:4:::6234177:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5719918:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6242691:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6378906:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6660163:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6643236:4:::6643236:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6461332:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5567145:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5719974:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5341620:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Rachel's Organic Strawberry Yoghurt::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::10.06.2008::::    I bought a Rachel s organic low fat yoghurt and when I ate it I thought how delicious it was. You can buy Rachel s strawberry yoghurt in most supermarkets. This yoghurt is not one of the cheapest at    1.46p for a 450g pot (price Ocado) I notice Ocado have an offer 3 pots for    3 This yoghurt is presented in a plastic pot with a picture of a red strawberry on the Rachel s black and white packaging. One of the reasons I bought this was it is low fat    . 1.6 g per 100g pot it contains 86k cal per 100g too. I reckon to get 3 or 4 servings out of this 450g pot, more if I add it to cereal or fresh fruit. This yoghurt is also available in a 150g pot cost about 65p.This yoghurt is organic milk and organic strawberries; I like this as I dislike the amount of herbicides and pesticides that are used in food production.This yoghurt is a really good yoghurt tastes delicious. This slightly pink strawberry colored yoghurt has a lovely smooth creamy texture. In the yoghurt are a few pieces of juicy strawberries. The taste is real strawberry a gentle taste not overpowering. It is not over sweet just right. The nose of this yoghurt is pleasant a  hint ofstrawberry  and a milky yoghurty undertone,This yoghurt is so delicious I could eat the whole 450g pot by myself. This yoghurt is not for those with dairy allergies/intolerance as it is made with cow s milk. This yoghurt is good for the digestive system as it contains the cultures Lactobacillus bulgaricus   Streptococcus thermophilus as well as bio-live Lactobacillus acidophilus   Bifidobacterium, which are supposed to general digestive well-being. Overall this yoghurt is a really good one.     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::5370902:3:::5370902:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5584168:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5633987:3:::5633987:3:::5475218:3:::5475218:3:::5646482:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::6639882:3:::6639882:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5522492:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::21963:4:::6145850:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6242691:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6288851:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5567145:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5719918:4:::6609678:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5719974:4:::6452575:4:::6452575:4:::5341620:4:::5633146:4:::5714912:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5816422:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Arisaig, Scotland::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::08.06.2008::::    I went north last week for our half term break, north to Scotland we stayed at Arisaig on the west coast, on the road to the isles latitude 58.8912N Longitude 5.8419W national grid reference NM660844.We have been to this village several times in the past but must be nearly 15 years since we last visited. This seaside fishing village is about 35 miles North West of Fort William it takes about an hour by car. Carry on past Arisaig and about 8 miles further is Mallaig a small fishing town where the Ferry to Skye and other islands leave. It only takes only takes about 15 minutes by car to get from Arisaig to Mallaig.We arrived in Arisaig mid afternoon after our 14 hour journey including stops from our home about 40 miles North of London its about 10 hour driving time.. There were a few roadwork s just as we were getting into Arisaig as they are building a bypass round the village.After leaving the A 830 turning onto the coastal road for about 1     miles there is a turn to Rhu on the left. keep straight on in to Arisiag The instant we turned into the village we are met with the view of the bay loch na ceall, Arisaig harbour which opens to the Atlantic ocean.. The bay is a picture the rocky craggy coastline, the view over the harbour several boats moored and the rocky outline of the cove. The beach itself at Arisaig is pebbly rocky and has a lot of seaweed collected on it not really ideal for putting your deckchair on and playing in the sand , but there are several beaches very close which are perfect for making sandcastles and digging holes. Although we had not visited for 15 years I do not think the village of Arisaig has changed much. There is the new road at the back of the village which will make it quieter and not disturbed by so much Passing traffic.. Just into the village we note the land sea and Island Centre, just past this there is a private car park. This is where we pull in as our flat is opposite it. We get out of the car stretch and feel the beauty, the peace. Take a walk with me along the bay there a few cars on the road just look out to sea with me it really is glorious walk along the path across a little grass we come to the pier. The pier is not a very long one it s a working pier. It is not really attractive but functionable. Boat trips on the Sheerwater go out from this pier to the islands of Rum, Eigg and Muck; these trips are good for watching wildlife, see http://www.arisaig.co.uk/ for details. There is a small boat yard here and a little parking .The bay only continues a little way past the pier. Cross over the road now and at this end of the village is the hotel. The hotel a large white building built 1720 was originally a coaching inn. There is some outside seating in front of it looks quite attractive. I have never been in it but with its views over the bay I think it would be a good stopping place. There are 113 ensuite bedrooms in the hotel; a room here cost    50 per person per night cheaper for longer staysContinuing back along the bay back to our car there is the caf    Rhu that serves food all day, and then there is the library lodge another place to eat or have morning coffee. Then there is the Spar shop. This shop is not really very big but stocks essentials If you are camping or self catering near Arisaig you would probably get by with goods bought from here but you might be better to do as we did stock up for the weeks meals in Fort William and just use the shop for bread milk and other bits and bobs. This Spar does a good trade usually has customers in it.There are a few cars parked in the streetThe post office is next to the spar and then a short walk back to our car.There are a couple of residential streets behind the sea front with white painted houses before you reach the A 830. The Railway from Fort William to Mallaig runs the other side of this road Cross the road the station is up another street the other side of the A830 it is signposted. There are cycle paths on some of the roads as cycling is a popular way of exploring this area (hubby and son in law took their cycles and spent a couple of days cycling the mountains).The small railway station is the most westerly station on mainland Britain, There is mo staff at the station so buy tickets in advance or on the train. . There are a few trains each day that go from Fort William to Mallaig and back again stopping here and at other stations between the towns.Harry Potter has made this line famous as it is the one featured in the film. There is a steam train that runs once a day in the summer from Fort William and back again however it seems not to stop at Arisaig to most of the small stations between. On the outskirts of Arisaig and in the surrounding hills there are a few farms and crofts Turn back with me and walk back to our car Now we are at the sea front again and its much later the sun is going down it is a magnificent sunset over the islands and islets that this coast is famous for its a glorious end to the day.I found out that this small village is said to be the birthplace of Long John Silver.Thank you for walking around Arising with me. I do long to go back again already     ::::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6668409:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::21963:4:::6448877:4:::6614064:4:::6614064:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5522492:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6242691:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6458341:4:::6458341:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5719918:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5279552:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5584168:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5620008:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6647517:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5719974:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6461332:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6101464:4:::6101464:4:::5646482:4:::6660163:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5577439:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5341620:4:::5961041:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6609678:4:::5216928:4:::6474927:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6647513:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5633146:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5811168:5:::5811168:5:::6477551:5:::6477551:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Asda Mint Chocolate Covered Puffins::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::19.05.2008::::    When I bought the orange puffins in Asda I just had to have some mint ones too. 8, 25g chocolate covered biscuits for 61 p is quite good value 29.9 p per 100g; they are on offer 4 packs of 8 biscuits for    2 so even better deal.These biscuits come in packets containing 8 individually wrapped biscuits. As you might guess they are wrapped in a mint green package have the word asda puffin on the front and pictures of the biscuit.I have eaten one of these biscuits they are completely covered in a fairly thin covering of chocolate; it is a good tasty milk chocolate .The biscuit is a chocolate biscuit sandwiched like a bourbon biscuit. The filling is a mint tasting cream filling. The mint flavour is nice refreshing not too strong. Now this biscuit does taste delicious. It was a good sweet biscuit snack at a very good price.You can still buy puffin biscuits although In 1997 there was a court case by Penguin who claimed there were too many similarities between Puffin and Penguin. I believe there was a cartoon Puffin on the Puffin biscuits which has now disappeared. For details of this case see http://www.iprights.com/cms/templates/articles.asp x?articleid=60 zoneid=2. I think it s just a case of sour grapes as Mc Vities know these cheaper biscuits are considered to be better than Penguin biscuits by some people. I think that these puffin biscuits taste as good if not better than penguin biscuitsThese biscuits contain 530kcal per 100g so about 132 kcal per biscuit. These biscuits are an ideal size for taking in a packed lunch to school, to work or on a picnic. They are a cheap biscuit at about 8p each.     ::::6766749:3:::5522492:3:::21963:3:::6609678:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5678412:3:::5678412:3:::6239059:3:::6461332:3:::5370902:3:::5370902:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5719918:3:::6650830:3:::6651046:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::6639882:3:::6639882:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5816422:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5399986:3:::5399986:3:::6591498:3:::6598141:3:::5961041:3:::5624348:3:::5624348:3:::5439461:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::5285637:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6242691:4:::6212982:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6145850:4:::5633146:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::16615:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6288851:4:::6647345:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6506177:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6648643:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5719974:4:::6521661:4:::6452385:4:::6450234:4:::6644527:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5805660:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6378505:4:::5347743:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Early Learning Centre Sand Scoop::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.05.2008::::    The summer months are coming holidays on the horizon. If you have children you know they love sand and water play. . Remember those hot sunny days on the beach digging with your spade making sand castles, burying dad or mum? Do you remember playing in the sand pit at school or nursery? Just maybe. Maybe you were lucky and you had a sand pit in the garden. The Early learning centre sand scoop. I am going to tell you about today are one that I have seen in several nursery/play school situations. The early learning centre sand scoop is designed for children two to eight years old. The older children with manual dexterity problems find it good to use as well as the tinies.This sand scoop is made from a strong thick plastic. It is available in a variety of colours I have seen and played with a blue one and a red one. I think the colour available varies from time to time. This sand scoop is a scooping, digging tool. It has a short handle that is ridged to make the grip easier for a little hand. At the top of the handle is a hole so you can hang it on a peg when not in use, put a loop of string through it if you wish The back of the scoop is part is molded onto the handle the quite high sides of the scoop which are rounded the taper down from the back to a low blade (not sharp.) edge. There is a flat area between the high scoops edged to collect the sand onto. This tool is ideal for a young child as they can scoop sand onto it and keep it on for longer than if you give them a flat spade. This is good as it is so discouraging to children to start to move sand and find by the time they have got to the sand bucket there is no sand left on the spade.. This sand scoop will help your child s hand eye coordination. Helping them practice using their hands and arms with purpose. Helping develop their reflexes, opps you are tilting the scoop be careful the sand will all fall off. (A bit of science there too sand falling off spade gravity.) This sand scoop will also help your child develop their creativity. OK so at first it is only digging and moving sand into heaps or piles. Your child s heaps of sand and excavations will slowly develop into castles moats, roadways. Your child s imagination will develop while they are creating many  castles  you have to use your imagination too  that s a lovely tower sweetie   It s a rocket daddy cant you see . While you child is playing in the sand with their easy to use sand scoop they are learning a lot. Sand is one of the best first play tools. Sand is a wonderful tactile experience digging fingers into sand feeling it run through fingers the feel of sand grains on an arm or leg. Your child learning the properties of sand .Predicting what will happen. (Oopps I dug too deep the sides of my well fell in.) Playing with sand is quite therapeutic too restful..Sand can be played with individually or as a group activity learning how to, work with others. It might be an idea to have 2 sand scoops to prevent arguments or only one to promote sharing.( remember sand in eyes hurts wash out with copious quantities of water not putting any pressure on the eye) A child will play for hours in the sand with a sand scoop and other sand tools. I know my grandchildren spend hours playing in the sand tray I have in the conservatory. We can watch them easily there, keep the mess levels down also let them play independently joining in when asked. This sand scoop is only    2 from http://www.elc.co.uk/SearchProducts.php?words=sand+scoop submit.x=13 submit .y=9  you can buy it online here or pick it up when next in town as delivery is    4.99 which is ridiculous for a    2 toy.So do I recommend? Yes, it s a good strong toy, will last several children s play hours. Thanks for reading do enjoy playing in the sand as well as being FUN and Educational for your child it can be fun and therapeutic for you too.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5584168:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5522492:4:::21963:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6242691:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6452385:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5370902:4:::5370902:4:::6450234:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5646482:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239059:4:::5731546:4:::5731546:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5567145:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6288851:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5961041:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6461332:4:::5719974:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6447607:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6604409:4:::6625623:5:::6625623:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ladybird Dwarf Gold Cosmos::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::13.05.2008::::    The Cosmos that I shall be describing today is the flower Cosmos, not the book by Carl Sagan, or the Universe. The Cosmos is a pretty garden flower of the summer. The cosmos is native to Mexico and southern America. It is a daisy like flower in the composite family Asteraceae.When I think of Cosmos I think of the delicate feathery fern like leaves which grow opposite each other on the stem. Depending on the variety the Cosmos will grow into a bushy plant 30-90 cm tall.The flowers growing to about 3 inches across are daisy like with petals around the yellow centre, some varieties are single some double. The cosmos can be red ,pink, gold, white there is one with a  dark  maroon flower that smells like chocolate , sorry chums you can not eat it .The chocolate Cosmos is a perennial but the others are annuals. The cosmos flower is good as a cut flower in your flower vase The golden ladybird cosmos that this category is for is a dwarf cosmos growing to 12 inches /30cm tall so if you want a shorter cosmos this is ideal.. The taller cosmos can get blown over easily in a windy position these shorter flowers stand up better .This cosmos is pure gold , golden petals and golden stamens, it really glows in your flower beds. If you cut this flower for your vase it will last about 7 days inside .The cosmos is a flower that will be in bloom from late June till August /September when a lot of other garden flowers are beginning to fade. The Cosmos really brightens the garden, and although I have noticed it apparently the cosmos attracts butterflies, I am growing some this year and shall take special note on sunny days to see if the butterflies do visit the flower for nectarI shall sow my seeds in May in a pot in the greenhouse keeping the seeds moist. I will transplant them into the garden when they are big enough. Cosmos can be sown straight into the garden. Sow shallow in the soil. You can buy Cosmos seeds both on and off line. They are reasonably prices at about    2. See http://www.unwins.co.uk/cosmos-double-click-seeds-pid964.html or http://www.johnsons-seeds.com/acatalog/flower_seeds_9.html for example. The chocolate cosmos is available as a bare root from http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ProductDetails.asp?ProductID=12130. 3 plants/roots cost    9.99. So fill your summer garden with riots of colour from cosmos flowers held above their feathery lacy leaves, I shall.     ::::5522492:3:::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6452385:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5633146:4:::6288851:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6463063:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5646482:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5921889:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::21963:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5584168:4:::5335750:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6242691:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::5719918:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5366599:4:::5366599:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5719974:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5690767:4:::6470690:4:::6603737:4:::5961041:4:::5567145:4:::6647513:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6239059:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6556647:4:::5439461:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6648643:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Recently someone bought in some Jaffa cake mini rolls.These mini rolls come in a packet of 6. I believe you can also buy packets of 10 too . The individual Jaffa cake mini roll comes in a blue plastic foil wrapping to keep it fresh. The writing on the   wrapper is in orange.I opened the wrapper 6 cakes and disclosed a mini Swiss roll all covered in chocolate. I bit into the dark chocolate; it was a good tasting chocolate. It was a very thin layer that cracked when I bit it. I lost a few crumbs of chocolate onto my lap. Inside the chocolate coating was the cake a very pale yellow cake. The cake was a light sponge tasted ok. This sponge cake was a Swiss roll type and the centre filling was that jaffa cake orange gel like stuff. This tastes orangey and sweet. This cake did not last long enough for 3 or 4 bites. A bit unsubstantial .They are not really filling  These mini rolls are fine if you are a Jaffa cake lover. They would be good as a treat in the lunch pack, or at a children s party. Mc vities have really just found another way to package their jaffa cake really. The cake part softer, not as crispy as in a jaffa cake, this ones defiantly a cake not a biscuit. Nutritionally well 119kcal per cake /383 per 100 g 3.6 g fat per cake 16 g of sugar per cake. (I really should not have eaten this cake too fattening for me.)I noted these on sale at Tesco a packet for    1.25, 21 each roll, on offer at the moment 2 packs for    2.00To be honest I am not a eat lover of jaffa cakes so I will not go out of my way to but or eat these again.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::21963:3:::6609304:3:::6609304:3:::6647517:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5633146:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::6211424:3:::6211424:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6468819:3:::6468819:3:::6222117:3:::6222117:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6577281:3:::6577281:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::6461332:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::5646482:3:::5816422:3:::5439461:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::6513143:4:::6513143:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6242691:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6651411:4:::6470690:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5996826:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6450234:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5584168:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6639882:4:::6639882:4:::6647513:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6452385:4:::5719918:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6239059:4:::5620008:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5770793:4:::5770793:4:::6581111:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6378505:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5567145:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6442533:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6374904:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5719974:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6378906:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

It is a great low growing ground cover plant.  Grows 3 to 5 cms (1 to 3) inches tall and will spread in large patches.  Creeping Jenny sometimes called moneywort. Creeping Jenny is a perrenial Creeping Jenny has round soft yellow green leaves about 2cm in size these grow opposite each other. The leaves stay on over winter. The flowers are a bright golden yellow. The flowers appearing in June till august have 6 petals and are cup like; each flower grows singularly on a short stalk. A carpet of this plant looks very pretty green leaves sparkled by the yellow flowers. The flowers last a few weeks This plant grows on vigorous stems which grow runners which grow roots, so they do not need a deep soil. They are easy to propagate by breaking a piece of this stem off and transplanting it. You can plant this flower at any time of the year your soil allows.  Although creeping jenny likes a moist soil it will grow in many conditions. This plant is a good rockery plant or will grow on a border under the trees.

So as you can see this is not an expensive plant to buy .     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5522492:3:::21963:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5584168:3:::5186837:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6577281:3:::6577281:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::5633146:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6647517:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6470690:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6452385:4:::5690889:4:::5690889:4:::5719918:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6288851:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5719974:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6242691:4:::5335750:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::5646482:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6647513:4:::6239059:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6378505:4:::5714912:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5567145:4:::5347743:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5805660:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6219525:4:::6219525:4:::5439461:4:::5996826:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Ronda (Spain)::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::29.04.2008::::    We needed an Easter break so we went to the Andalusian Mountains of Spain. We stayed in accommodation not far away from Ronda. I was very impressed with this town so will tell you about my visit here. Ronda is inland from the Costa del Sol it takes about an hour to drive the113km from Malaga. Ronda is easily accessible by train from Algerciras or Granada and the stations in between. We were lucky and found a place to park the car in one of the streets but there is a car park by the bull ring and some other underground car parks too.We drove to Ronda from the village we were staying in Ronda is a great viewpoint with views of mountains the most fantastic scenery. The   narrow gorge, Tajo del Ronda, 150 meters deep runs through the town .The Guadalevin River runs along this gorge. There are three magnificent bridges to span the gorge. Parts of the old town walls still stand. The town of Ronda is an old settlement from Celt times. The later Roman and Moorish architecture are most prominent. There are several museums many eating places and shops. There is a bull ring which is used in fiesta time. There is a museum in the bull ring we did not visit as I am not a lover of bull fighting.  There is also an art gallery.After my husband and I mooched around the streets a bit we stopped for lunch ay a caf    (I can not remember the name of it sorry.) we had a good leisurely lunch. The people we met seemed very friendly.The town is an attractive town it feels friendly and the streets are quite spacious. Some of the buildings are painted white as is popular in this area of SpainAfter lunch we went to the 14C Mondragon Palace in the old town.  This palace has a museum in it. And is a great place to visit with its mosaics and inside patio gardens. This is really a prize architectural building. I shall write fully about this museum in a future review.   We only spent the day there I would be happy to go back and explore more of this town one day. If this review tempts you then these are several information sites about Ronda. A good site is http://www.andalucia.com/ronda/home.htm and http://www.turismoderonda.es/indexeng.htm. A word of warning this town is in one of the wettest areas of Spain and has high rainfall. So do take your waterproofs or umbrella.     ::::21963:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5633146:3:::5646482:3:::5584168:3:::5678162:3:::5678162:3:::6639882:3:::6639882:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::5961041:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5809210:3:::5809210:3:::5859788:3:::6647517:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5816422:3:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::6452385:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6242691:4:::6581111:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5685284:4:::5255134:4:::5720245:4:::5720245:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6288851:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5719974:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5567145:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5719918:4:::6168379:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6532964:4:::6532964:4:::5690767:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5837129:4:::6378505:4:::6470690:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5347743:4:::5341620:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6239059:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5439461:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Allium::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::27.04.2008::::    Have you any Alliums in your garden?Allium is the name of the onion genus in the Alliaceae family. Onions, leeks, chives garlic are grown for culinary purposes; I grow all of these and have written reviews on them in the individual categories. There are many Alliums grown in the flower garden too, Allium christophii, Allium cowanii and many others. To see a good range of Alliums go to http://www.broadleighbulbs.co.uk/plantlistpages/allium.htm.It is unlikely that you will let the Alliums you grow to eat flower unless you do so by mistake not picking and eating at prime time. But the aim of Alliums you grow in your flower garden is top let them flower. The colours of the allium flowers range from red, blues, purples, yellow and whites. Some are almost metallic and shine in the sun. Growing alliums is easy . An allium grows from a bulb or from seed. Both of which are available from off and online garden centers. http://www.crocus.co.uk/search/_/search.allium/ has several pots for between    4 and    5 ready to transplant into your garden now. A packet of flowering alum seeds from ttp://seeds.thompson-morgan.com/uk/en?er=msnuk;term=seeds will cost about    1.50p.The Allium will flower late spring to summer. Allium bulbs can be planted in the autumn, if you grow by seed grow in spring for flowering the following year.A common Allium to be grown in the flower border is Allium cristophii I think that is the one Dad grew in his garden.  This flower grows from about 25 to 40cm tall/10 to 16 inches . Other allium species can grow smaller or taller. A few strap like leaves grow from the bulb and the tall round stem shoots upweards on top of the stem forms a ball of many star shaped flowers. The  flower ball measures  up to about 20 cm  8 inches accross. If you let it the flowers will seed you could collect these to try and grow more next year . The bulb will last in the soil many years flowering and beautifying your garden . The bulb will produce bulblets and multiply this way too.Alliums like a sunny position and a well drained soil they do not really need a lot of care. This is a magnificent flower to put in a border Thanks for reading . Writting this review has reminded me I was going to put some more spring onion seeds in the veg plot this morning , must go .

       " '5247778::::Asda Orange Flavoured Puffin::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::25.04.2008::::    Asda orange puffin, I went into an Asda shop near my daughters and bought some chocolate biscuits they were Asda orange Puffin biscuit.Puffin biscuits are available in a mint or a chocolate filling variety too. Orange puffin biscuits are in a pack of eight individually wrapped biscuits. The Orange Puffin is enclosed in an orange wrapper; it is a plain orange with the word Asda orange Puffin on it. Each biscuit weighs 25 grams. These biscuits are about the same size as Penguin biscuits.In 1997 there was a court case by Penguin who claimed there were too many similarities between Puffin and Penguin. I believe there was a cartoon Puffin on the Puffin biscuits which has now disappeared. For details of this case see http://www.iprights.com/cms/templates/articles.aspx?articleid=60 zoneid=2.  The Orange Puffin biscuit costs 61p for a pack of 8. They are on offer buy 4 packs for    2 this offer runs till 31/12/208.Ok, so I open my Orange Puffin biscuit packet and I find a chocolate covered biscuit bar I break it open and the biscuit is a chocolate sandwich biscuit with an orange cream center layer. The chocolate coating is thin; it tasted like a good chocolate. I can also taste that the biscuit is chocolate flavored too. The biscuit is like a bourbon biscuit. The orange cream filling tastes quite sweet and orangey it is a pleasant orange flavour not too strong but definatly there. I like these Asda Orange puffin biscuits. I shall not enter into the debate as to whether they are better than PPPenguin biscuits, but I think they are a good cheaper alternative.These biscuits contain 530kcal per 100g so about 132 kcal per biscuit. These biscuits are an ideal size for taking in a packed lunch to school, to work or on a picnic. They are a cheap biscuit at about 8p each. They will not count in your 5 portions of fruit in your diet though     ::::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::6609678:3:::21963:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::5719918:3:::6242691:3:::5646482:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5584168:3:::6197992:3:::6197992:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6378906:3:::6468819:3:::6468819:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5664713:3:::5664713:3:::5439461:3:::5522492:4:::6448877:4:::6470690:4:::6452385:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5633146:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6211424:4:::6211424:4:::6609542:4:::6562051:4:::6562051:4:::6288851:4:::5719974:4:::6647220:4:::6647220:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5779979:4:::5779979:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5921889:4:::6378505:4:::6442533:4:::5341620:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6506177:4:::6239059:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5347743:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5816422:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6310942:4:::5961041:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5837129:4:::6628390:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Post War Kitchen - Marguerite Patten::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::23.04.2008::::    My mother born in 1920 was a young woman in the Second World War years. She worked  quot;in service quot; for a family cleaning fetching carrying she worked in the kitchen helping the cook. She also drove a large milk truck which picked up milk from the farms. . Sadly she died 43 years ago. My Father died just after Christmas this year and while clearing their house I found a book of my mothers Post war kitchen by Marguerite Patten O B E. This book was published in 2001. I expect it was bought for her as a present .The food and facts in it are post war from 1945 -1954. She was nostalgic for those times when she was a young wife and mothers my sister born 1950 myself 1954. Marguerite Pattern for those young things who have only heard of cooks such as Delia Smith and Jamie Oliver was more than just a cook. Marguerite Pattern worked for the ministry of food in the war. Ashe took charge of the ministry of food Bureau at Harrods. Her role was to help families provide nutritious and appetizing food with rationing and food shortage that continued after the war.This book is a soft back with 111 pages. This book is not purely a cookery book it has a page or two of information about each year between 1945 and 1955. for example about 1948.  quot;The ministry of food published a specialty economy Christmas cake with mock marzipan quot; Throughout the book there are advertisements of the time. Advertisements for foods such as weetabix, spry millers baling powder, and information adverts for example one about bread crusts ,  quot;no scrap is too small to waste  quot; adverts from the ministry of transport quot; do you know what traffic is  quot; an advert about considering others on the road, moving swiftly but safely . There are several articles about the royal family, some full page pictures. The recipes in this book are varied from breakfast recipes potato cakes, kippers, bacon fritters, eggy breadRecipes for soups, How to make chicken broth, how to cook a chicken, rabbit or pigeon. A recipe for good old staple steak and kidney pudding. Bread biscuit and cake recipes. I find a recipe for mock cream using corn flour thickened milk, adding butter or margarine sugar or icing sugar and beating it hard for a long time. Apparently this was very acceptable. Recipes include dried pea soup, mock marzipan, pigeon ragout, salmon dip, lemon barley water, uncooked chocolate cake The names of a lot of these dishes are ones I remember ones my mother cooked when I was little. . The ingredients used not exotic ones. I think this book interesting to anyone interested in food from that time. I shall keep it to use a recipe or two from when we are doing a topic about that time in history at school  I doubt if I shall use it as an everyday or special occasion cookery book. I might do into this book occasionally when I am in a cooking mood to try some of the cake or biscuit recipes, I might even try a recipe economical with meat.I think this book quite a good one well written and laid out.  I have seen this book available from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Post-war-Kitchen-Nostalgic-Facts-1945-1954/dp/06006 02559/ref=pd_ts_b_23?ie=UTF8 s=books for    2.50 upwards. I think this book would be worth having if you were interested in food and cooking in the post war era.     ::::6461332:3:::6657747:4:::6703843:4:::6703843:4:::5522492:4:::21963:4:::6452385:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5633146:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6242691:4:::6609542:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6552833:4:::6552833:4:::6450234:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6288851:4:::6603737:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5584168:4:::6378505:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5422850:4:::5422850:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6557158:4:::6557158:4:::6239059:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5296797:4:::5296797:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5646482:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6439698:4:::6439698:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5816422:4:::5961041:4:::5567145:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5840413:4:::5840413:4:::5719974:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6168379:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Lever Taps::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::07.04.2008::::    Lever taps.As you might have guessed from the topic I have chosen to write about I was searching for inspiration, no idea what to write about. I came across taps, lever taps no one else has written anything about them. I have used many lever taps in other people s houses and public conveniences. Dads kitchen taps were levers. Since this topic does not specify whose make of lever taps I thought I would write what little I know. When we had new kitchen and bathroom taps fitted a while ago there was great thought on which taps to choose. Which style? Lever taps , mixer taps, single taps, traditional taps, the ones you press and a small amount of water comes out then stops (not sure what they are called). So Lever taps, simple a tap with a lever to turn to open the tap and let the water out. So why choose lever taps?  Well they are easy to, use good for those with manual dexterity problems Dad with arthritis found it harder to turn a tap you twisted a lever tap easy peasy. You may like the design better than others; personally I prefer the traditional tap with the bits you twist.There is a wide range of lever taps to choose from single taps, mixer taps, chrome, bronze white, and silver, gold. Several different manufacturers make them. The prices you can pay for a lever tap are varied too.I just looked at a few .A  Franke lever tap called little butler cost    369.00   at http://www.kitchenscience.co.uk/kitchen_sinks_and_taps/taps/single_lever_ta ps/~franke/                                      http://www.victoriaplumb.com/copy_of_tap_33.html has a high rise lever tap for    69.99 You can buy a lever tap top to convert your tap with from Wickes for    19. For a hot and cold tap top. Its    44 for a lever tap from http://www.discountedheating.co.uk/shop/acatalog/Armitage_Shanks__Sandringh am_SL_Bathroom_Taps.html. At the better bathrooms .com which I found via amazon I found a pair of basic lever bathroom taps for    33.The main difference in the prices is because of the style, a tap costing    500 is defiantly more stylish than one at    30.00. The metal used to make them may be better. Some taps will be better made than others with better closures, ease of use designed for your hands better. It is a relatively simple job to plumb in your new replacement lever taps , hubby put some new taps on our sink   . Go to http://www.diyfixit.co.uk/diy/plumbing/taps/taps.html if you want /need instructions on how to plumb in new taps. Otherwise find a local plumber most shops where you buy the taps will be ableto give you a plumbers phone number.If I were to advise you if you were to be purchasing a new tap or two, it would be to note any good taps you see in other peoples houses find out what make they are. Look in show rooms and try the taps (ok they may not be plumbed in) but you will get more idea than just looking at pictures     ::::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5522492:3:::6243934:3:::6243934:3:::6684623:4:::6684623:4:::6200027:4:::6200027:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6239059:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6452385:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5719918:4:::21963:4:::6310942:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5255134:4:::6145850:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6538926:4:::6538926:4:::6288851:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5454586:4:::6242691:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5620008:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5843359:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5921889:4:::5646482:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6588100:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6601458:4:::6601458:4:::5743196:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5719974:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5567145:4:::6521661:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5961041:4:::5816422:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5439461:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Broad Beans::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::29.04.2003::::    I have just planted my broad beans in the garden. They are the variety Sutton. This variety is a dwarf bean.I sewed the beans in little pots at the end of feb/ beginning of March and put them in the green house to give them a god start.I like to get my broad beans started this way helps them get started with out the slugs/snails damaging them.       (Living on chalky soil and growing organically I do get a lot of snails) I could have seeded them in situ in the spring or for a very early crop in the autumn.  My plants are now about 3 inches high with several leaves on.They like well-dug, manured fertile, well-drained soil that is low in nitrogen, their root nodules fix atmospheric nitrogen, and so they are a good plant if your soil is low in nitrogenThe seed need to be planted about 4cm/11/2 inches deep about 8/9 inches20/23cm apart, Sew them in a double row or in a block. The tall varieties need to be supported with canes. I support my dwarf varieties too as the get knocked by the wind.I water mine regularlyOnce they start to flower pinch the growing tips out this helps reduce blackly and encourages pods to form. You should be able to start harvesting spring grown 12-16 weeks after  seeding. Other pests are mice they love to dig your beans up and eat themBroad beans have a lovely flower visited by many a bee. These flowers develop into a pod, which contains the beans. The pod in itself is enchanting. Ever heard the harvest hymn that says broad beans are sleeping in their blankety bed? The pods have an inner lining of a soft white fur like a blanket.Pick the pods while plump but do not leave too long or the beans are not too nice. Can t remember roughly how many bean in a pod but I reckon 5-8. I think these are a good veg to grow with children, as they are quite quick to grow and develop. If you grow these in a clear glass trapped against the side with tissue they soon develop roots, a great beginning science lesson about growing and that plants need water try growing two one with one without water. Which one grows? Why/. (Sorry that s the teacher in me (well assistant anyway))It is so good also to show children beans/peas do not just come from a jar or a pkt from Tesco s That they grow. Broad beans are tasty to eat apparently the very young small pods can be eaten pod and bean when they are only 2-3 inches, /5-7 1/2 cms  Pod your larger beans and cook in boiling water for about 10 mins Old large beans can be cooked but best used in a soup. Broad beans are served traditionally with a parsley sauce. They are great served with Ham and bacon I have just checked something on the internet and it suggests broad beans are good for you in preventing or reversing bowel cancer There is an article in the British medical journal  gut  that states that the lectin a protein found in broad beans can prevent or even reverse Bowel cancer. So I shall certainly try to eat more now .Thanks for reading now be good children and eat your beansMary     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5762857:4:::5487381:4:::5487381:4:::5020702:4:::5326218:4:::5326218:4:::5285637:4:::22828:4:::22828:4:::5270047:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5305389:4:::5030684:4:::5030684:4:::5291026:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::5288843:4:::1692:4:::1692:4:::5246873:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5253538:4:::5330693:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5317659:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5288376:4:::5288376:4:::5240200:4:::5310553:4:::5241037:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5307978:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::5303269:4:::5271854:4:::5271854:4:::5308666:4:::5323268:4:::5311794:4:::5311794:4:::5243567:4:::5243567:4:::5126903:4:::5066688:4:::5066688:4:::5332164:4:::5248345:4:::5334094:4:::5314908:4:::5223538:4:::5025486:4:::5025486:4:::5085331:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5311952:4:::5245206:4:::5245206:4:::5240190:4:::5262664:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Green Plates: Large Green Baseplate Educational Toy::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::04.04.2008::::    As any woman knows it s good to have a firm foundation from which to build from, whether it is her undergarment or her face paint. It is also inportant for a building to have a firm foundation, The same goes for your child s Lego building. Lego make several foundation plates one is the green 628. This thin, flat base plate is 10 inches square that s about 26cm square. This plate has 32 studs to fit Lego bricks onto. The plastic this base plate is made from is soft and a little bendy the edges are smooth and rounded it will not cut your fingers. . This base plate is thin because you can only fit Lego bricks to the top of it not the bottom. This base plate is green ideal for representing grass around your 3D Lego model. There are grey and other coloured base plates available but this one I think is the better colour for a starter.Built onto this base plate I have seen many castles, houses parks, zoos, shops, oh the list is endless. You might not recognise the building your child has built but I assure you in your child s mind it is the most fantastic representation of the building that they are thinking of.Lego base plates are good because they make it possible to be more creative, your child can build more things easily than just towers. Using a base plate keeps Lego buildings together. To make a large play scene you can fix two or more base plates together by joining them with Lego bricks. Not only can your child use these base plates to fix their models to but they can make mosaics using the different coloured bricks. This helps their maths skills.Lego is a good toy it is very durable so it will last a long time. This base plate is unlikely to break unless it gets really badly treated.This base plate is available in many stores that sell Lego. On line it is at the Lego store http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=626 am p;cn=21p cost    3.99 + postage    3.25. This is a pack of one base plate no bricks included. On line at EBay US I notice new ones for  9.95 or on the UK site EBay has one used its current bid     2.70 plus postage. Amazon price is    6.99p .There are other Lego base plates available different sizes different colours some are thick some thin.I think this toy is suitable for a child of 4 and over. Adrian my grandson at 4 was just interested in the smaller Lego, only just having the fine motor skills to fit them together. Now at 5 he copes well making many lego models.The pieces of the small Lego are not suitable for younger children as they are small and baby will put everything in his/her mouth. This base plate is designed for use with standard Lego, but it can be used to fit the larger duplo bricks in it. They do not stick quite as firmly but they do fit on .Duplo is twice the size of standard Lego.Since this base plate can be used with many other Lego constructions so I think it will be used by a Lego loving child until they are 10 or 11.     ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5584168:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5646482:3:::5690889:3:::5690889:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::5439461:3:::5719918:4:::6239059:4:::6452385:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5770793:4:::5770793:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6288851:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6243305:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5314908:4:::6242691:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5921889:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5843359:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6588100:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5816422:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5719974:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5302119:4:::5302119:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6378505:4:::5441621:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6425824:4:::6425824:4:::5567145:4:::6557158:5:::6557158:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::County Plastic Leaf Rake::::House & Garden::::40::::helpful::::31.03.2008::::    I am sure this county leaf rake is the one I owned for about 15 years. If not its very similar. Unfortunately it went to that great garden in the sky when it got put in a bonfire  Plastic melts silly girl.This county rake is by Spear and Jackson who make a lot of garden tool. They are a good maker and their equipment usually lasts a long time. This rake has a 10 year guarantee.Let me describe this rake.This rake has a long tubular steel shaft. This has a long soft grip covering for comfort. I seem to remember the shaft was green.The black plastic head fits onto the shaft snuggly ours never came of it. The width of the head is 24 inches. It has 24 black plastic prongs/tines. The plastic tines are slightly flexible.This rake is strong and should last a long time ours would have lasted longer except I left it too near/ in infact (I don t know how that happened) a bonfire and the plastic melted too much. So what did I use this rake for? This plastic rake is a leaf rake good for raking up all those autumn leaves or the grass after mowing with a machine with out a grass collector. The plastic is a bit soft for using on the soil to rake it flat after digging. The rake head is good and wide so makes raking a quick easy job. This spear and Jackson county rake is a good rake easy to use not heavy. The RRP is    22.99, but you can often get it cheaper. I found it just now at http://www.tooled-up.com/Product.asp?PID=8705 for    19.94 I expect this rake is available at other on and of line garden centers too. Enjoy your gardening.

       " '5247778::::Corgi Ford Model T Van Lyons Tea::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::30.03.2008::::    When sorting out my dads possessions we discovered a couple of corgi model cars one was a model of a ford model T van with Lyons tea advertising on its side. Corgi is a Northampton firm that started making colorful pressed metal toys in 1930. In 1956 the first corgi model cars appeared. These cars are now collector s pieces. The corgi Lyons tea van that I found was made around 1985. It was made as a collector s model.  These cars are not really made for young children but for those aged over 14. This model van measures 9cm long by 4cm wide it is 5 cm tall. This van is I believe a true copy of a Ford model T van. The Lyons tea van is made of a blue dye cast metal. On the side of the van are the Lyons name in gold and the company address in black. The roof of the van is white the radiator trim gold the wheels gold with black tires.The doors at the back and the side of this van are not able to be opened. The front window is a clear see through plastic. Inside the cab is a black seat for driver and passenger and I can see a steering wheel, this is a left hand drive vehicle.This van is attractive, bright and shiny. Although not a collector I can see the attraction in these old corgi classic model vans  I expect like my dad I shall put it away in a cupboard the grandchildren too young to appreciate it fully yet. This model van was produced as a limited edition not sure how many were produced Maybe one day this might be a valuable antique but I am not holding my breath.

       " '5247778::::Siberia Squil::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::27.03.2008::::    I  visited my dad s house ta few days ago and his garden looks beautiful full of spring bulbs. I noticed the Siberian Squill (Scilla siberica) a beautiful bright Prussian sky blue.In spring green narrow grass like leaves grow in a rosette. Then in March and April they flower.. The flower stem grows to about 15cm tall. Each flower stem has 1, 2 or 3 flowers these are bell shaped with 6 petals a darker blue vein runs up the middle of each petal. The anthers are blue too. The flowers can grow up to an inch 2 centimetres long are very pretty delicate looking. They will flower for 2 to 3 weeks. The smell from the flower is a delicate flowery aroma, nice and fresh. Bees like to visit this flower. It must produce a fair amount of nectar.These flowers look good planted in mass they look good in a single species group or with other spring bulbs. These flowers need sun to be successful but will bloom well under a tree (not conifers). They will naturalise easily if left alone. Siberian Squill like a moist well drained soil. They look good in planters and can be forced to flower early.The Siberian Squill grows from a bulb which you can buy in many garden centres off and on line. Once established the squall will multiply and soon cover a flower bedThe Siberian Squill is from the Liliaceae family it is native to central Asia and the Middle East.

       " \"5247778::::Lego Emergency Rescue: Doctor's Car::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::24.03.2008::::    Its an emergency call the Lego City 7902 Doctor s Car  . What s this its still in pieces you have got to make it first?  Hurry up it s an emergency. There are 66 little Lego pieces to make this car. The doctor and his first aid bag are included with this car. The car is a 4x 4 with blue lights and a radio receiver, antenna on the roof the antenna moves. The windows are blue tinted .There are two side cupboards big enough to put the doctors bag and the vital signs monitor which is also included.  The side doors open and the doc will sit in the driving seat. His limbs are moveable so you can change him from standing to sitting position to put him in the car. Trouble is there does not seem to be room in the car for a patient; I guess this car is for house calls only then. This Lego car is suitable for children aged 5 and over a bit fiddly for younger children and pieces small so easily put in mouth and swallowed. I think the car looks more like an American doctors car to me I have not seen an emergency car like this in the UK. There is a first aid blue star like emblem on the vehicle roof and side.Personally I would prefer to buy an English style doctors /emergency vehicle for use with children in Britain but You may wish to use this car either in America or with an American child or for a topic involving the need for an American emergency vehicle. This car is available in America and in the UK   In America it costs  9.99 from Amazon and http://stores.ebay.com/Tillys-Treasures_Lego-City_W0QQcolZ4QQdirZ1QQfsubZ87 82183QQftidZ2QQtZkm  It costs    .3.99 from http://www.toymaster.co.uk/shop/Lego 20CITY.html and from    3.90 from Amazon.This car would be a good addition to the Lego hospital. Your child will be able to practice their fine motor skills fitting the pieces together. It is good for imaginary play and for play therapy reliving or living out possible emergencies helping your child understand and deal with the emotions from a real emergency.Lego is a Danish company formed in 1932 making step ladders, ironing boards. And children s toys. In 1937 the designers 17 yr old son started designing and making the early Lego toys, Lego is an adaptation of the Danish words that mean play well also in Latin it means I put together. Lego bricks are well made will last many play hours. wash well. Lego bricks are a good educational toy .Would I recommend? Yes if you had American contacts but otherwise buy an English style doctor and car or ambulance. Thanks for reading enjoy playing with your child and their toys.

When we go roaming in the summer we usually take a picnic of cheese and bread. One of the cheeses we have taken with us is Roncal this cheese is called after the villages in the valle de Roncal in the Navarre region of Spain. Roncal cheese is a sheep s milk cheese made from breeds of sheep that graze the high Pyrenees. I wonder as I sit down to eat my lunch if the cheese came from milk from the sheep I see grazing around me.This cheese is a hard cheese with a light orangey brown rind. This cheese is made in a wheel shape. The texture chewable when in the mouth its moist firm and smooth. This cheese has a slightly nutty flavour hint of olive it has a smell a light smell cheesy. The flavour is not a very strong one as it gets older the taste also matures.This cheese goes well with crackers or bread and a lovely bottle of wine. Writing this I just have the desire to be on a sunny grassy mountain hillside with a loaf of Spanish bread a portion of Roncal cheese and a bottle of red wine to compliment it.Oh well I can dream maybe I can pretend I shall buy some bread and wine and some Roncal cheese from a shop I am sure I have seen it in Supermarkets and delicatessen shops in England.Sorry can not find the price on line, but you can buy it a kg for    14 from http://www.ibericogourmet.com/listados.php?familia=QUESOS subfamilia=QUESOS  20OV. producto=0102019-I idioma=inglesfor     ::::6609678:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::21963:3:::5522492:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::2385:3:::2385:3:::6152305:3:::6152305:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5646051:3:::5646051:3:::5584168:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5843359:3:::5646482:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5244087:3:::5961041:3:::5816422:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6239059:4:::5719974:4:::5285637:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5633146:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5719918:4:::5921889:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5567145:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::6242691:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5261772:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6288851:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6506177:4:::6521661:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5687811:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5347743:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5439461:4:::6378505:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6627171:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5296797:4:::5296797:4:::6577281:4:::6577281:4:::5743196:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio 34534 Builder System: Construction Vehicles Set (244 Pieces)::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::22.03.2008::::    We bought my grandson the Brio 34534 Builder System: Construction Vehicles Set. This set cost us    39.99p.The recommended age for this toy is 5 years. I think that s about right a child may be able to manage to build this at a bit earlier age but certainly over 4 years old. I think I can see Adrian playing with this until he is about 8 years oldThis set comes with 244 pieces and includes a flashing light and engine sounds. There are 2 button batteries needed these came with the set. There are heavy duty wheels and linking pieces to make a caterpillar track also included are 3 plastic tools a screwdriver, a hammer a spanner.Basically this set makes construction vehicles; it will make 5 different ones. It makes a digger, a carrying truck a caterpillar vehicle and other pieces of machinery I do not know the name offThe pieces are made of wood and plastic the main construction pieces to make the trucks are wooden. There are plastic screws /nuts and bolts a plastic bucket a plastic compartment for the driver. The caterpillar tracks are plastic too. Brio construction sets are really good toys they are ones that children will play with happily and learn while they are playing.A child will get value playing with this on his /her own or with other children. Playing with this toy constructing vehicles helps their fine and gross motor skills. This set will inspire and encourage your Childs creativity. Once built your child can play with the vehicles and Adrian was fascinated by the fact it had a light and made engine noises. Adrian pushed his creations around using them to construct and move other objects, Adrian is playing at being a construction worker. His friends can join in too helping them learn co-operative play, how to share Brio construction is well made the pieces robust. This brio set would be suitable for a child care situation or for home. I am sure it will still be in a good condition to sell after my 2 grandchildren have outgrown it, or they will be able to keep it for the next generation.Overall Yes I think this is a good toy I am sure it will provide hours of pl     ::::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5719974:4:::6239059:4:::21963:4:::5522492:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6450234:4:::5633146:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5719918:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6242691:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5843359:4:::5244087:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6222560:4:::6463063:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5646482:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6628390:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6626101:4:::6588100:4:::6292861:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::6212982:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5816422:4:::5347743:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5439461:4:::5743196:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::RU Left Handed Scissors::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::21.03.2008::::    Are you left handed? Do you find using right handed scissors a trial? I have several left handed children at work and to make life easier for them we have some RU children s left handed scissors.  These left handed scissors have been designed so that they are a reversal of right handed scissors They are easier to use by a left handed child. Young children can find it difficult to master cutting with scissor skills imagine the extra trials and difficulty if you are left handed using a right handed scissor. There are 2 types of RU scissors available. Childs scissors which have 5x 10 mm sections marked on the blade these cost    2.05. The school, scissor which has a stainless steel blade with blue plastic handles, one of the blades is sharp the other a rounded blunt one these cost    9.95. There is also another school scissor both of these blades are blunt with and rounded points. These also cost    9.99p. These scissors are available at the prices above from http://www.ru-lefthanded.co.uk/pages/items_for_left_handed_children.htm I find cutting with a lot of children s scissors very difficult they have been designed for but these RU scissors do cut well. They will cut paper and thin card with no problem. While at the same time being designed as safe as possible the blades not razor sharp and the ends rounded. The scissors have plastic handles soft so they do not cut into a Childs hand. These scissors are well made they maintain a good closure. They are good for a classroom with many children using them also would be ideal at home for your left handed child.Even though these are a child s scissor and relatively safe please supervise your young child while they are using scissorsRU make other left handed tools too see http://www.ru-lefthanded.co.uk/ for their range .I wrote this mainly as am article about childrens left handed scissors but RU make a variety of scissors for adult hands . Ordinary scissors , nail scissors, embtoidery scissors , dressmakers scissors, nurses scissorsand kitchen scissors are all available from RU left handed.My husband is left handed but has learnt to manage right handed tool  or to use his left hand, somethings are more difficult than others.At one time left handed children suffered as they were made to use thier right hand and so were not able to achieve the dexteritory and accuracty ib thier work. Happily we have now moved on from this although we all natrually present things the right handed way . My hubby always tells me left handed people are cleverer than right handed ones,:-) Sorry if this only just qualifies as a toy but unsure where else to post this oppinion.     ::::6139816:4:::6139816:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6239059:4:::21963:4:::5522492:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5633146:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5719918:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6242691:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6222560:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6626101:4:::5584168:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5743196:4:::5347743:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5843359:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::6442533:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5244087:4:::6288851:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5719974:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5567145:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6461332:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6588100:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5275136:4:::5275136:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6617415:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5439461:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::5816422:4:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::6452385:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

I also have a few of these flowers brightening up a damp corner under the bushes in my wildlife garden.Greater stitchwort will flower through till June early July timeThis flower/ plant greater stitchwort/ Stellaria holostea is a perennial it is a fairly common wild flower. You may confuse this with lesser stitchwort which as its name suggests is a lesser smaller plant. There are similar smaller stitchworts which are commonly called chickweed.Some chickweeds are edible people eat them in salads but not sure about stitchwort so do check it out properly before eating.Stitchwort is so named because when running and you get a stitch  rubbing stitchwort onto the affected area will cure the ache  not really sure as to the validity of this .Greater stitchwort is a straggly plant the stems are square, weak and flimsy they grow opposite each other. It leans on other plants for support. They grow about 15 to 60cm long. The leaves are a fresh green colour stalks, they are long and narrow they have sharp edges.The white flowers are small 5 to 18mm across. They have 5 divided petals so it might look like 10.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil Panda Family::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::17.03.2008::::    Playmobil make many small plastic toys. These toys are good for creating play scenes. There are many people figures of all walks of life also many Animals. The playmobil toy I am talking about today is the panda family.Playmobil have been making toys for over 25 years. Their toys are all a good quality sturdy and will last a many play hours. They are suitable either for a child care centre /nursery/school or for home. There is a playmobil zoo and many other animal sets the panda family would make a great stand alone toy or an addition to another playmobil toy. The playmobil family set consists of a grass green base this measures approx 5 inches by 3 inches. There are a few plastic tufts of green grass that stand on this base. Also there are two bamboo trees and a bush the tallest is about 9 inches high. This set has 3 panda s a daddy panda a mummy panda and a baby panda. The adult pandas a good size to fit in a Childs hand and for them to manipulate. The baby Panda maybe a bit small and if I had a young child who puts everything in their mouths I might remove this from the play scene unless I was watching all the time.   Your child can place panda in the trees and create an imaginary world. The pandas have friendly features and look loveable.  These Pandas would make an ideal present to a child aged between 3 and 8  . They would make a good addition to the playmobile zoo . This toy costs somewhere between    9 and    10 .    8.99p at http://www.edirectory.co.uk/pf/880/default/d/playmobil/mt/c/rid/13451/pn/H    10.02p at http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk/toys/playmobil-panda-family.asp.

       " '5247778::::Willow Tree (Salix)::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::16.03.2008::::    Where do I start to tell you about willow? There are literally hundreds of different species willows in the genus Salix. The willow/ Salix are a native tree of England and other countries too. Some trees of the Salix species are miniature and grow only 6 feet 2 metres tall other species grow up to 60 foot/ 20 metres tallA willow tree is probably one most people will recognise for the flower catkins commonly called pussy willow. Some of the willow species produce this flower it s a soft stroke able almost furry little catkin about 3 to 7 cm long. It s very sensual; if you have some near you I defy you not to stroke at least one catkin. If you look now you will find pussy willow catkins on willow trees. They bloom before the tree gets its first young fresh green leaves. A catkin is lots of little flowers all grown together. The willow tree can be either a male tree or a female tree the male pussy willow catkins get yellow pollen on the fluffy catkin which is either blown in the wind or carried on an insect s nose or feet to a female tree with female catkins. The female catkins are a lesser catkin and a pale green colour. After pollination the female catkin flowers make seeds and they break up and fall or blow in the wind to set root elsewhere in moist soil.The leaves of a willow tree are long and thin.The branches of the willow tree are long and pliable the bend and sway in the wind rarely breaking.The willow likes a moist soil often growing by or where it floods. If you are looking for a pussy willow for your garden do check the details of the species to find the most suitable one. While I was looking on line for small varieties I found that the site http://www.jprwillow.co.uk/willow-varieties.htm has a lot of willow trees and a fair description of their nature and height. When you hear the name willow you will probably think weeping willow. A few of the willow s have a weeping habit and look lovely as their branches droop and weep over a pond or stream.Another popular garden willow is the twisted willow its branches twisting and coiling looking very attractive. Twisted willow look fantastic grown as a bonsai tree.The willow has many uses they are often grown as a cash crop. The branches pollard and the willow canes used to make furniture and baskets.  Willow is also used to make wind breaks and trellises for the garden. I personally love willow baskets. Weaving willow canes is a craft that many people take up. Classes held in adult education centres.  .The willow cane is very pliable can be bent and woven fairly easily.Willow is grown in osier beds for this purpose the trees coppiced. There are osier beds I know in the Ouse washes. Where the land floods then dries out The willow tree is a good wildlife tree.  Many insects like the Camberwell beauty butterfly will feast on the nectar from the catkins lay its eggs on the willow and the caterpillar eat the leaves for food. Many moth species also use the willow as a nursery. Bees and other insects feed on the nectar too. Many birds they like to use the willow for shelter and eat the many insects that live on the tree Bats like the insects in the willow tree you might find that bats will also roost in a large willow. Talking about bats the cricket bat is made of willow wood.Without the willow we would not have aspirin/ Aspirin acetylsalicylic acid. The leaves and bark of willow is sometimes still chewed and they gave pain relief. In 1828 the active ingredient salicin was isolated and used for pain relief in 1860 a method of making acetylsalicylic acid by a commercial process this eventually developed into the drug we all know now as aspirin.Now finish with a little romance The Chinese willow tree pattern is on 100s of plate s cups saucers bowls. This design is an English one 200 years old made to encourage people to buy crockery. The design as if you did not know is blue and white. There is a pagoda a bridge a three people on the bridge and a willow tree, two birds in the sky. The story behind this design is that. The maiden was in love with a boy who was not thought worthy by her father he had chosen another for her. The boy was imprisoned further down the river the tale goes love notes were sailed in paper boats along the river and the maiden caught them at the bridge. The love thwarted youngsters were killed and they are represented as the doves flying away together. If you wish to see this tale in full I found it at http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue32/iss32p5.html.Sorry this has been a bit long but these are so much to tell about the willow.

       " '5247778::::Cadbury Button Easter Egg::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::11.03.2008::::    I might just buy someone a Cadbury buttons Easter egg as a treat this Easter. I note they are available now on line and in the shops.Most of us acknowledge Cadbury chocolate as one of the better ones, and most of us will have eaten many of their products especially chocolate buttons. Cadbury have been making chocolate since 1824 by John Cadbury, in Birmingham, Easter eggs were manufactured since 1875Chocolate buttons have been the childhood treat for years and years. Cadbury have made Easter eggs and filled them with bags of chocolate buttons for years too. Each year the design might change in some way.  These Easter eggs are designed really to catch the younger age market, well may be the older market like me wanting to treat the little ones in the family.I note there are 2 sizes of Cadbury buttons Easter egg available this year a 105g egg and a 190g egg.Although Cadbury are reducing the amount of packaging for Easter eggs this year (so they say) these eggs comes in a cardboard box to protect it .The box is a Cadbury blue with a picture of an Easter egg nestled in a field of green grass with chocolate buttons scattered around with a chick hatching out of the egg. There is a small window in the picture of the egg so you glimpse the real egg inside. The egg itself is wrapped in foil. The egg itself is a hollow chocolate one. With the egg comes a bag of chocolate buttons. The chocolate this egg is made off is Cadbury dairy milk I am sure I do not really have to describe it too you, but this chocolate is a good one soft creamy and smooth.   I looked at the prices on line and the 105g egg costs    1.45 at Wilkinson s shops190g egg costs    3.15 at Ocado who are also offering two for    5.50. If you want to save money buy your children a bar of dairy milk chocolate instead more chocolate for the price usually.  It s always a good idea to buy your children identical eggs as it will stop a lot of arguing and sad faces if the other sister/brother gets the egg that seems to be the best.Sadly these Easter eggs are not suitable for those with dairy allergies. They also contain 530 cal and 30 g fat per 100g. So not good for that diet. But isn t that the same for all chocolates.     ::::6609678:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::5473058:3:::5244087:3:::5584168:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5719918:3:::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5617685:3:::5617685:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5777170:3:::5777170:3:::6368847:3:::6368847:3:::5816422:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6609304:3:::6609304:3:::5522492:4:::5285637:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5743196:4:::6222560:4:::21963:4:::5633146:4:::6552447:4:::6552447:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6288851:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6629470:4:::6452385:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5085573:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5843359:4:::6520091:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::6204895:4:::6204895:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6242691:4:::6575562:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6443867:4:::6443867:4:::5335750:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6634581:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6221165:5:::6221165:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Colgate Total Fresh Stripe::::Health::::30::::very helpful::::10.03.2008::::    I use Colgate toothpaste on my pearly whites; have done since I was a teenager, when I changed from the toothpaste brand my parents used to the one my boyfriend used. During the past 35 years we have occasionally used other brands but come back to Colgate Colgate makes a few varieties of toothpaste the one I am using at the moment is the total mint stripe one.This toothpaste comes in a 50g or a100g tube. for 50g price 93p from Tesco and Sainsbury s for 100g.  cost    1.54 at Asda,    1.58 at Tesco on offer at Sainsbury s and Ocado 2 for    2.50 till 10/3/08  This tooth paste comes in a tube in a card box. This has a fresh blue green stripe colouring and the Colgate red colours and the Colgate logo plus the words fresh stripe.Squeezing the toothpaste out of the tube is fairly easy .The consistency good for putting a little on a tooth brush.  You only need a pea sized blob.This toothpaste is not suitable for children under 7 years old, that s ok I have a tube of special children s toothpaste at my house for the grandchildren.This is pale green toothpaste with white stripes. This toothpaste has a mild spearmint flavour pleasant clean tasting. It leaves your mouth fresh, your breath smelling good.This toothpaste is designed to help prevent cavities, gingivitis and plaque helps prevent the build up of tartar tooColgate says Colgate Total Fresh Stripe is clinically proven to protect the above and below the gum line, effective at fighting harmful bacteria. My teeth feel clean and look white after using this tooth paste.I note that the active ingredients in Colgate fresh stripes are fluoride and triclosan.I note some concern about the use of triclosen in toothpastes. Triclosen is used for its anti bacterial agents in toothpaste and other anti bacterial soaps. It is reported to be a possible human health risk and an environmental risk.  It is suspected of causing cancer. Read the report at http://www.health-report.co.uk/triclosan.html for further info. The companies that manufacture products containing this chemical claim that it is safe, I  think its possible that the small amount used mean it is fairly safe however I am not sure I shall buy this Colgate product or others containing Triclosen again if I can help it .  Some anti bacterial soaps and sprays also include it I am led to believe.List of Active Ingredients______: Sodium Fluoride (0.24 ) (0.14  W/V Fluoride Ion), Triclosan (0.30 ). Inactive Ingredients: Water, Hydrated Silica, Glycerin, Sorbitol, PVM/MA.I leave you to decide wether this one is for you, I think I will check it out further now and probably use a different Colgate toothpaste.     ::::5522492:4:::6222560:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::21963:4:::5314908:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5085573:4:::5719918:4:::6450234:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6242691:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5186837:4:::5584168:4:::5843359:4:::5244087:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5646482:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::6599475:4:::6599475:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::6588100:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6461332:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6310942:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5743196:4:::6476250:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5439461:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Grey Plates: X-Large Gray Baseplate Educational Toy::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::08.03.2008::::    Today I am telling you about the large grey Lego base plate 628  I have used this base plate to make constructions stand tall. This base plate measures 15 x15  /37 cm x 37cm I think that s 48 studs by 48 studs. Lego bricks being either 2, 4, 6 or 8 stud you can imagine this would make a large building.  This grey plate is a concrete grey so good for using as the concrete coloured base for a castle/ house /block of flats. I do not think this size base plate comes in a different colour but you could always surround it by slightly smaller green base plates to make your Lego play scene.  This base plate is good as it keeps all the buildings together then and it is good as you can keep your uncompleted model on this (out of the way under the bed maybe) to complete later.This Lego base plate although the same thickness as the smaller ones is flexible and wobbles /bends a little. I think its size makes it more likely to break a piece of than the smaller Lego base plates... I found this base plate on sale at the Lego shop http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=628 for    6.99There are several other places on line selling this Lego base plate I am sure you can buy it in high street shops too.Lego is a really good plastic construction system it s easy to clean just wash in hot soapy water. It is safe and helps your child develop educationally. Lego is a long lasting toy my daughteers lego 30 years old is played with by her 5 year old son , good if you can get some in the charity shop .This base plate is useful to keep all your Childs Lego constructions on they can use their imagination to develop a scene of many different buildings positioning them on the base plate , Lego is good educationally for helping develop your Childs creativity and does help practice the motor skills , fitting the small studs together properly..Lego is a toy building system. It links together with little studs in each brick.Lego is a Danish toy company founded in 1932 making step ladders, ironing boards. And children s toys. In 1937 the designers 17 yr old son started designing and making the early Lego toys, Lego is an adaptation of the Danish words that mean play well also in Latin it means I put together.These pieces are recommended for children aged 5 and over but I think that it s suitable for slightly younger children. Have fun making your Lego models on this base plate. I think I would make a rocket and space station if I were building Lego on this now.     ::::5522492:4:::5743196:4:::6222560:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::6288851:4:::5719918:4:::5085573:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6242691:4:::6450234:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5584168:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5843359:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6461332:4:::5244087:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5714912:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5480196:4:::5480196:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6588100:4:::5439461:4:::6219525:4:::6219525:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes - Eve Sutton::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::07.03.2008::::    My cat likes to hide in boxes is a picture puffin paperback children s book, by Eve Sutton the author and Lynley Dodd the illustrator and author. This book is suitable for children aged 5 -8 years old. I think a younger child would enjoy listening to the story This book was first published in New Zealand in1974 it is the first children s book by Eve Sutton and Lindley Dodds first picture book.  Eve Sutton who is Lynley Dodds cousin goes on to write older children s books while Lynley Dodd s goes on writing and illustrating books for younger children .f you work with /have had or were a child after 1983 you will most likely have read Hairy Maclary My class of 10 year old special needs children loved this book when I read to them. I also read it to my grandson aged 5 years old he loved it too.I read to the class from a big book A 3 size. My grandson read from a standard book sized 22.2 x 18.6 x 0.4 cm.  There are 32 pages.  This book is available as a soft paperback or a hardback book, I have a feeling it is also available as a board book too. Have you a cat?  If so then it is highly likely that your cat likes to hide in boxes too. I know when we owned a cat ours did. Our cat would find a box discarded in a dark warm corner climb in it and go to sleep.  Now are you sitting comfortably then I will begin to tell you about the story. The story begins and we are told, my cat likes to hide in boxes. The story continues with each page featuring a cat from a different country. Underneath a picture of each cat there are some words  quot;The cat from quot; then the name of the country  quot;Spain, France, Norway, Brazil, Germany, Greece and Japan. Then on the opposite page there is a statement about that cat so for example  quot;The cat from France    . Likes to sing and dance quot;  quot;The cat from Brazil caught a chill quot; After each double page of a cat from a different country we turn the page and we see an illustration of a cat and a box and the words But my cat likes to hide in boxes.The book finishes Cats from many different countries may like to do all kinds of strange and exotic things, but my cat, an ordinary round-the-house cat, likes to hide in boxes. This book is written in rhyming text, fun to read and hear. The text is repetitive so children soon learn the text and will soon recognise each word.  My pupils some able to read  some not soon learnt the words and joined in reciting the story as it was read to them. . When I read the book sometimes I would make it fun by putting on a foreign accent The illustrations are very good each cat is dressed in a way relating to his country, for example the cat from France is wearing a beret.This book was good enabled us to talk about other countries looking at maps and costumes You could extend this book as you like. Our topic other countries developed from this book we did foods from other countries. We used boxes and toy cats as props for this story. We also used a beret a fan a tissue for the cat from Brazil who caught a chill, we had a toy aeroplane, a card doorway  a toy violin. We also did a play about this book for the parents. Each child was a different cat from a different country dressed up with the costume of that country with the relevant prop. Then we had one child as my cat he had a cardboard box of course. This book was good enabled us to talk about other countries looking at maps and costumes, as well as just having a fun time.

       " '5247778::::Lego Police: Police Motorcycle::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::02.03.2008::::    I was playing with the Lego police motorcycle at work the other day. I pushed it fast through the streets and my policeman helped the Lego lady find the lost Lego boy. My police man got back on his motorbike and rushed through the Lego streets, there had been a Lego car accident. Then my Lego police motor bile had to go to a robbery he was met by the Lego police car the Lego policemen sucessfully caught the robber and took him to Lego jail. No I am not getting into my second childhood; I was at work playing with a group of children. I love my job it allows me to play with all the toys.This Lego police motorbike is a good addition to any Lego set. You can buy it at most toy or toy departments or look on line where you can buy it at http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=7235 . Where it only costs    2.99. I am sure it is available at many other toy sites too. This Lego toy is not suitable for a child under 3 years old due to its small pieces. It is recommended for children aged 5 and over. I think a 4+ year old would get some enjoyment out of this toy depending on the individual child and his/her maturity. A child may need a little help constructing this police motorbike, but mos6t should be able to build it as the shapes of the pieces are a bit more obvious than the masses of standard bricks designed to build a house. This set includes a policeman with a motorcycle helmet, blue light bricks , bricks with  police written on it , a walky talky so your policeman can talk to  other officers. There are several other Lego sets which could be used to compliment this single police motorcycle, Police stations, police helicopters and more. Look at the Lego site http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=K7741 cn=153 for all the sets available. Thanks for reading I had better go now my Lego police motorcycle must go he has just seen the Lego farmer speeding This Lego police motorbike has 28 pieces to fit together it can be a bit fiddly to some children. There is an instruction leaflet in the box that this Lego comes in. This has full instructions and diagrams how to put the 28 Lego pieces together to make the police motor bike.Making the police motor bike  is good for helping children perfect their fine motor control and practice their construction skills. Lego is always very durable and washes well if needed.The police motor bike and the policeman that comes with it are good for helping children s social awareness and play. This toy can be used in play therapy to help relive any experiences a child may have had with the police. Playing out real events somehow makes it feel safer for a child helps them understand.     ::::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6624527:3:::6624527:3:::5522492:4:::6222560:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5646482:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::6204895:4:::6204895:4:::6609304:4:::6609304:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5770793:4:::5770793:4:::6618142:4:::6618142:4:::5473058:4:::6609542:4:::21963:4:::6239059:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6629470:4:::6450234:4:::5633146:4:::6242691:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5719918:4:::6591498:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5584168:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5843359:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6288851:4:::6598259:4:::6598259:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6461332:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6506177:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6219525:4:::6219525:4:::5816422:4:::5450992:4:::5450992:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6474927:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5439461:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Miniature Bullrush::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::29.02.2008::::    I occasionally trawl through the plant section to see if there is a new plant added that I know about so that I can write a review. I often notice the category for miniature bulrush and refrain from writing however recently I visited a garden centre and looking in the aquatics saw one of these plants so decided now I could write a little about miniature bulrushes.Since I was a child I have been fascinated by bulrushes as a family we would often walk by the east Anglian ditches and see the standard bulrushes occasionally pick them. In fact once I stupidly had one and sprinkled the seeds around a small home pond they grew and took over for a while till we dug them up and made sure they did not produce set more seeds. The standard bulrushes are too big for a small garden pond. Miniature bulrushes Latin name. Typha MinimaThe miniature bulrushes look perfect for growing by the side of a garden pond or I think would be perfect for growing in an aquatic tub. The ideal solution if you do not have room for a garden pond. A miniature bulrush is exactly as it says a perfect miniature bulrush. This will grow to between     and 1 metre tall. The standard bulrush grows 1 to7 metres tall. The miniature bulrush is a marginal plant growing on the edge of ponds or water features. It would be good to grow this in a basket At the edge of the pond so you can keep the roots under control and remove and move the plant easily.The miniature bulrush has thin reed like leaves. . The bulrush flower grows on a stem taller than the leaves. The tiny brown flowers grow in summer, forming a stumpy cylindrical head.   Leave the heads on into autumn and they will form seeds the seeds are small white and fluffy like down and they will blow away in the wind. The shape of the bulrush looks good in the garden. If you want to buy a plant your local garden centre will probably oblige you, or I noted that  http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ViewBasket.asp?AddProductID=10451 Product ID=10451 continuepage=http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ProductDetails.asp?

       " '5247778::::Bronte Selection Cakes::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::29.02.2008::::    In the 19 60 s a company calling itself Bronte cakes established itself making cakes in Haworth   Yorkshire . I am anticipating that most of you know that Howarth is the village where the Bronte sisters lived. The 3 Bronte sisters all wrote books Jane Eyre by Charlotte, Wuthering Heights by Emily and The tenant of wild fell hall by Ann.The company in Howarth sold out to a Livingston firm Patterson Arran, who have since expanded the range of products with the Bronte name calling its products caf    Bronte new products oat biscuits and muffins produced. The Bronte cakes are still produces there are 6 flavours of cake that I am aware of. All of these cakes weigh 15 oz /425gm. They are wrapped in plastic cellophane that is seeing through. The labels centre top of the cake has the Bronte cake logo the name of the cake it contains and a description of the cake and the contents. There is a Bronte Fruit   Brandy Cake this is a fruit cake that contains sultanas and cherries.The Bronte Rum and Butter Cake is a cake made with Rum and butter  Then there is the Bronte Stem Ginger Fruit Cake this is a cake containing sultanas, stem ginger and citrus peel. Next a Bronte Dark Genoa Cake this is a dark fruit cake containing sultanas and cherries.The Bronte Dundee Cake is a fruit cake containing sultanas and topped with almondsThey also make a Bronte Cherry Walnut Fruit Cake is a cake with cherries and walnuts. I believe they also make an iced Christmas cake too.There is a warning with all these cakes that they might contain traces of nut and may contain fruit stones. A warning that they contain Gluten too.I have not eaten samples of all these cakes but have eaten the stem ginger and the dark genoa cake. I am not allergic too but dislike nuts and have discreetly picked the almonds of the Bronte Dundee cake. My favourite is the stem ginger cake.These cakes look quite attractive have almost a home made look about them. These cakes cut well into slices not crumbling too much. They are fairly moist and flavoursome. These cakes area reasonable quality for a shop bought cake.I have bought these cakes at shops attached to motorway services when on my holidays the price I seem to remember about a pound. I seem to remember seeing these cakes available at small convenience stores too.. You can purchase them on line at http://www.englishteastore.com/brrumandbuca.html    for between   5 and  6I seem to think that Bronte cakes supply cakes and biscuits more to cafes and eating places than supermarkets.

       " '5247778::::Brio Mallard Train Set::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::28.02.2008::::    BRIO 33191 Wooden Railway System: Mallard Train Set By Brio Brio wooden trains are fantastic; they are a well made long lasting toy. Brio started out in the early 1900 s by Invar Bentsen a basket maker who soon designed and made wooden toys. My grandson has a large collection of trains and railway tracks some brio some other makes. I anticipate that the brio trains will well outlive his play and be stored for the next generation.He does have a Brio Mallard train which can be bought on its own or as part of the BRIO 33191 Wooden Railway System: Mallard Train Set. This mallard train set is compatible with the Brio wooden railway system made from beech wood. It is a large layout having 19 pieces of track including 2 sets of points and a bridge.  1 curved track and a mechanical switching track.The engine is obviously the Mallard and some 2 carriages with the set too. There are 5 figures including a guardsman and some passengers .All these make the lay out realistic. This railway set is suitable for a child aged over 3 years  olds. Let their imagination take over; encourage your child in their play.. Not only will this set provide stimulation for your Childs imagination but it will help their motor skills placing and fitting the track arranging the other track furniture. Brio trains are linked with magnets so this is a learning opportunity too.I really think this is a super set with the Mallard train.The mallard is the fastest steam locomotive in the world. Mallard reached 126mph/202kmph.  Designed in the 1930 s by Sir Nigel Gresley, an engineer who designed the Flying Scotsman. The Mallard ran on the LNER London Edinburgh route till the 1960 sIf you want to play trains you can buy this set at  http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk/toys/brio-mallard-train-set.asp for    49.99 /E74.99http://www.amazon.co.uk/BRIO-33191-Wooden-Railway-System/dp/B000FZ N8W2 MEATS THAT PRICE ITS    48.99P many other places sell it too.Enjoy playing trains with this set I know Adrian and I do.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5816422:3:::5743196:3:::6608659:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6577281:3:::6577281:3:::6222560:4:::5646482:4:::6609542:4:::21963:4:::6288851:4:::6629470:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6450234:4:::6242691:4:::5633146:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5584168:4:::5719918:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5617685:4:::5617685:4:::5439461:4:::5843359:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6461332:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6318281:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5777170:4:::5777170:4:::5373680:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6412105:4:::6412105:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The flowers could be white, yellow, red, purple or blue.  The flower only lasts one day.The 5 inch long leaves shaped like a heart.The morning glory climbs up the trellis twisting and coiling itself along the tree branches for support itThe Morning glory is a plant in the Convolvulaceae, family there are several species of this plant. The Morning Glory likes the sun all day it will climb to 10 foot or more perfect for hiding a tatty shed or garage wall. You will find the morning glory flowering June till October depending on species. The morning glory will produce seeds in a seed pod after the flower has dropped of there are about 5 seeds to a pod.The morning glory does not like its roots in too moist and fertile soil. Morning glories do not like to be transplanted so if you are starting one of in your greenhouse soon use a peat pot that you can plant with the plant.I believe that in the US humming birds will feed from the nectar of some morning glory species. You can buy seeds for morning glory fairly easilyhttp://fothergills.co.uk/en/morning-glory.aspx  has packs of 40 -50 seeds for    1.50-2.00 /. Other seeds merchants are similar.

       " \"5247778::::C�te d'Or Exp�riences 70% Cocoa::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::27.02.2008::::    Come on have a dark experience with me, a piece of Cote d or Experiences 70  Cocoa.  I love dark chocolates and this is no exception. You can buy a 100g bar in Tescos for    1.29p. This bar is wrapped seductively in a dark card wrapper with gold writing. It looks like a glimmer of light is falling on a picture square of chocolate. I open the packet and reveal a dark coloured chocolate. This chocolate is quite a thin layer not thick and chunky. The squares are quite large not many in the bar, 6 or was it 8 squares in this 100g bar. It is possible to break each square into a smaller piece. The chocolate is quite brittle.Pop a square into your mouth and the flavour is dark and intense. The chocolate smooth and silky on your tongue There is a crisp outer shell of chocolate which when bitten breaks into the rich dark chocolate centre. This chocolate is not oversweet it is slightly bitter and I get a hint of red fruits. Some of you who do not like dark chocolate much will find this chocolate very intense a bit bitter. I love it. One advantage of this strong tasting dark chocolate is that I do not feel the need to eat a whole bar in one sitting as the flavour is so intense a few squares at a time will suffice. A treat I like is to eat a square or two of this dark chocolate with a glass of red wine or a glass of port the flavours complement each other deliciously.Calories. Lots 180 per 30 g.  I also found out there may be traces of egg and nut in this bar.Cote D or was first made in Belgium 100 years ago, named after the gold coast Ghana where the cocoa beans for the chocolate came from. This company is now owned by Kraft foods the website has some good recipes for chocolate treats see http://www.cotedor.co.uk/cotedor/page?siteid=cotedor-prd locale=uken1 Pagec Ref=727..Do I recomend this chocolate ?

Well it might be Limnanthes douglasii otherwise known as the poached egg plant, sometimes called the scrambled egg plant too. This is an annual I remember my dad growing in his garden as a border plant. Sometimes dads would put on e in the patio pot.  Dad would sometimes grow one in a pot for my mum as a houseplant.As you can imagine from the name the flower of this plant looks like a poached egg ,  The leaves are a pale green the  flower saucer shaped is white tinged with yellow the centre of the plant  are a bright yellow. This plant grows about 6 inches/15 cm tall spreads across the ground for 15 inches/40 cm.This flower smells sweet it s a light perfume stronger in the sunshine.If you sow these seeds in March after the frosts you will be rewarded my flowers in June through till August. Sow in a seed tray with seed compost and plant out when big enough.  You can sow this seed direct into the ground. If you let the poached egg set seed you will get some self setting for next year .You could also seed this plant in June it will then flower indoors in the winter.I will grow this plant in my garden The poached egg plant likes the sun and a free draining soil it attracts bees, hoverflies and possibly butterflies. Some seeds merchants sell this seed in their wildlife attracting section.A packet of these seeds costs    1.70 from http://www.suttons.co.uk/pd_141452_Poached_Egg_Plant_Limnanthes_Douglasii_S eeds.htm also from http://fothergills.co.uk/en/limnanthes-poached-egg-plant-914.aspx.

       " '5247778::::Aster::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::22.02.2008::::    Aster this word means Star in Greek, to me the name means a flower of the Asteraceae family. This flowering plant is frequently called michealmas daisy. I like to grow Asters in the back of my flower borders. Where they bloom in late summer early autumn. There are a large variety of Aster plants some growing as tall as 3 feet some more suited to the front of the border only growing  6 to 10 inches tall. Small asters are good in patio pots The aster flower is a composite flower this means that what we see as the yellow centre of the flower is in fact lots of little flowers, what we see as petals are actually sepals. Other flowers with a similar flower us are dandelions or daisies. In fact the Aster flower looks very much like a daisy flower. Some asters are single flowers (one row of petals/sepals) other doubles (with 2 rows of petals /sepals) Asters flowers are   commonly blue or lilac purple coloured sometimes red or pink and sometimes yellow or white. There is a wide variety of hues in these colours. You can buy Aster plants from the garden centre or you can grow your own from seeds. Asters are a perennial plant flowering for several years. They like a well drained soil and a sunny position. I like asters as a lot of them are attractive to wild life. The nectar luring butterflies, moths, bees and other insects. Some caterpillar feast on the leaves. The Aster Frikartii/ monch is one I note as being particularly good for butterflies. The purple flower flowers in the summer and grows quite tall Height: Height 36-48ins (90cm -1.2m).

I thought I would tell you a tale of love lies bleeding. I went to my father s house at the weekend and was clearing out his green house and I found some love lies bleeding seeds. Love lies bleeding, Amaranthus caudate is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. This plant is an annual need to be grown every year.I shall try to grow a few of these seeds for my own garden I hope the seeds are not too old and still fertile. These seeds should be sown March to April indoors April to May outdoors.To grow indoors in my greenhouse I shall prepare a tray of seed compost sow the seeds and keep them moist and warm, you could sow the seeds direct into your soil though. These flowers will probably self set in later yearsIn April or May the plants should be big enough to plant out in the garden about 1 to 2 feet /30 -60 cm apart. I shall put them towards the back of the border as they grow to about 3 to 5foot /90cm to 150 cm tall these plants do like a little moisture but should be ok if the weather is a bit dry. They are a hardy plant that likes the sun or partial shade. These tall plants have stems and leaves that are tinged with red. The blood red crimson flowers are form a long tassel like a catkin which droops several of these drooping spikes come from the same stem. You can see easily how the flower gets the name love lies bleeding.    This flower means love and immortality; I think this plant also is believed to hold medicinal properties do check these out  If you wish to have love lies bleeding in your garden seeds are available at http://fothergills.co.uk/en/amaranthus-crimson-love-lies-bleeding--162.aspx for    1.25p also you should be able to get these sees at most garden centres.

       " '5247778::::Brio Peek a Boo Roller::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::21.02.2008::::    I visited some friends with a young baby the other day and discovered their baby crawling around ( well more squirming around on her tummy really) She was crawling after and trying to grab a Bruin peek a boo roller she did this for about a minute before her attention went elsewhere , the toy was left on the floor and about 5 minutes later she discovered it again and started bashing it about.This peek a boo roller is an inflatable toy. When inflated it is a soft PVC cylinder. It is a beautiful blue colour with pictures printed on of teddy bears and other animals. Babies respond well to pictures of faces loving the eyes nose mouth combination.  There are a few clear windows in the blue these are for baby to peep through and see the inside of this roller. Inside are are some colorful jingle balls. My friend s baby was shown these balls through the peek in window; she looked for a moment then bashed the roller. The balls jingled so she did it again, the balls jingle when this toy is pushed along the floor.  The sounds are an incentive for baby to push this toy the windows are maybe a little small I think the rollers I have seen with larger see through areas are better. This toy will encourage motor control from your baby strengthening her/his arms while they push and bash this toy. It will encourage crawling as baby will like to push it away and then try to get it again this will strengthen her/his  leg muscles. It will also help a baby discover that if they push/ bah this objects it will move and jingle. A babies world is full of first experiences discovering what will happen if.  Toys like this will widen their experiences safely as this is a safe toy.I would recommend this toy for a baby aged about 3 months upwards to about 18 monthsThis toy is available from several on line shops it is mostly available at toys/babies are us at the price of    .3. 99p or  9.99 web site addresses www.toysrus.co. Bruin has been making toys for many years. The name Bruin means a baby brown bear. It comes from the name of the bear in a translation of a Dutch story about Reynard the fox. Bruin is the Dutch word for brown. Bruin toys are good they seem to last long enough for baby games. I would recommend a toy like this to encourage baby to crawl and to discover what happens if. Babies like knocking things down and the resulting clatter. Have fun playing with your baby s toys .Mary     ::::5719918:4:::6557158:4:::6557158:4:::6450234:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::6288851:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6239669:4:::5646482:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5522492:4:::5584168:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6601486:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6588100:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6448232:4:::6448232:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6190414:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::21963:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6368847:4:::6368847:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6474927:4:::5816422:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Tesco Raspberry Ripple Soft Scoop Ice Cream::::Food & Drink::::10::::helpful::::14.02.2008::::    Tesco Raspberry Ripple Soft Scoop Ice Cream. This caused a ripple of discontent in our house. I had no ice cream left in the freezer pre Christmas; hubby was doing a small tesco shop so I asked him to buy some. Hubby came home with  some vanilla and some Tesco Raspberry Ripple Soft Scoop Ice Cream this cost  him    1.39 for a 2 litre tub I think this is a fairly cheap price. I opened the lid of the ice cream and said are you sure this is raspberry ripple yes hubby said. The ice cream was a white colour and had a few flecks of red init. I spooned some into a bowl yes I could see a fine tracing of red I suppose that was the ripple. I did wonder if we had a dud tub without the raspberry rippled into it. But I think not as there was a slight thin tracing of raspberry rippled through some of the ice creamThis ice cream is described as soft scoop? Yes I was able to scoop some out of the tub into a bowl with my spoon but the ice cream was not as smooth and creamy as I would have liked. A very mild flavour a bit sweet and vanilla tasting, did I get a hint of raspberry from the ripple? Not really. So all rounds this was a disappointment fortunately we had only family guests and no one to impress. We did think about taking this tub back to tesco s but it was inconvenient then the shops were shut I could not buy replacement till ewe got to tesco after Christmas. We did actually eat it at Christmas and I pretended that it was not raspberry ripple and it was ok so-so. So next time I want raspberry ripple ice cream I will def not be buying this one.     ::::5719918:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5522492:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::5473058:3:::6320122:3:::6320122:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5750745:3:::5750745:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6288851:3:::5646482:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::2385:3:::2385:3:::6242691:3:::5317988:3:::5317988:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5465910:3:::5465910:3:::5186837:3:::5366599:3:::5366599:3:::21963:3:::6458724:3:::6458724:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6354980:3:::6354980:3:::6593927:3:::6593927:3:::6603187:3:::6603187:3:::5352779:3:::5352779:3:::6609678:3:::6442533:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::6241857:3:::6241857:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5693422:3:::5693422:3:::5802710:3:::5802710:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6496624:3:::6496624:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::6506177:3:::6448232:3:::6448232:3:::5714912:3:::6320657:3:::6320657:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::6219525:3:::6219525:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5085573:4:::5633146:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5243876:4:::5243876:4:::5921889:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6450234:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5410107:4:::5410107:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5261772:4:::6521661:4:::6588100:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Building Plates: Straight & Crossroad Plates::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::13.02.2008::::    There are masses of Lego sets available that I could tell you about because I have work with children many years and Lego is always a popular construction set to have in child care /school situations. Lego is also a popular toy at home for children to play with too.Children love to build play scenes with Lego constructing buildings or building vehicles. To help  make the scene there are base plates available some with just studs on to build the houses onto others like these are road ways  to drive Lego cars on these base plates also have studs around the flat road so that your child can use Lego bricks to make road side scenery or houses.Lego Straight   Crossroad  plates item number 7280.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      The road base plate I am talking about today is the Lego Straight   Crossroad  plates item number 7280.This set compromises of two base plates measuring 10 inches/25 cm by 10 inches/25 cm. / 32 studs by 32 studs.The base plates are a road grey colour.One of these base plates has a straight piece of road. The road runs across the base plate centre. There is a strip running along either side of the road of 6x32 studs. The roadway itself is flat to enable wheels to run on it. There are white dotted lines painted on the roadway, also 2 grey drain covers. There are white lines painted along the centre of the road it s just like a real road. The other base plate is the cross roads this is basically a crossroad represented by two flat stretches of road crossing each other. There are road markings on the 4edges of this cross road. In each corner of the base plate there is a 6 stud square. It s possible to put a Lego road sign fitting into this studded area.This straight and crossroad base plates are good for adding to other Lego road plates to make more complete road system. These road plates although fairly thin Lego are quite strong and durable. Your child can use them to make many road and play scenes adding whatever pieces of Lego takes their fancy.  Your child will enjoy running the Lego cars they have built on these roads also suitable for running small non Lego cars on too. Lego have quite a bit of road furniture available too road signs and traffic lights. Your child can get lost in their make believe Lego road system using this straight road piece and the crossroad to take them on their imaginary journey.Price~~~~~~ This crossroad and straight road baseplate7280  set costs    5.99 at http://www.millionsoftoys.co.uk/Toy_Shop/Lego/City/1783_Lego_City_7280:    9.245 at http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xDN-toys--building_sets_and_blocks-building_sets- to_lego_themes_lego_town  19.99 at http://www.nextag.com/lego-town/search-htmlInfo about Lego for those of you who didn t know.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              Lego is a toy building system.

       " '5247778::::Kraft Philadelphia Extra Light::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::11.02.2008::::    I occasionally buy a tub of Philadelphia cheese for my lunches. I have bought the extra light one recently. Trying to be a slim. Philadelphia Angel. You can buy either a tub with 200g of light cheese or a pack of 4 smaller mini tubs each containing 35 g.  All 4 weighing 140g.The larger 200g will cost you    1.28p in the main supermarkets the smaller mini tubs also cost    1.28p.This cheese comes in a white and light blue clean looking tub with the Philadelphia logo and extra light written on it. In 100g there are 110kcal, 5.1g fat, 3.5g sugar. But unlikely you will eat 100g in one go I think a portion is about 30g.Taste.  This is a smooth cheese has a light creamy cheese taste to it, a subtle taste. Sometimes I like to add a few chopped chives or tomato to it, this gives it more tang.  Philadelphia extra light spreads well and can be spread easily on to crackers, crisp breads or bread. I have even dipped a few breadsticks into it. . This cheese is a light flavour. I do like it occasionally.This Philadelphia light can be used in any recipe instead of a full fat cream cheese; there are lots of recepies at http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia1/page?siteid=philadelphia1-prd l ocale=uken1 PagecRef=661.Philadelphia cream cheese was first produced in 1872 by a dairyman William Lawrence in America. In 1903, the Phoenix Cheese Company k bought the business in 1928 Kraft bought the company. Philadelphia cheese in its many forms is well known and available in many places. If you wish for a light mild flavored cream cheese then Philadelphia extra light is good...     ::::5410107:3:::5410107:3:::6609542:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5522492:3:::5633146:3:::6506177:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::21963:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5326581:3:::5326581:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6145850:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::5693422:3:::5693422:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5296797:3:::5296797:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::6320122:3:::6320122:3:::5646051:3:::5646051:3:::5646482:3:::5371022:3:::5549598:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::6461332:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::6297090:3:::6297090:3:::6637105:4:::6637105:4:::5719918:4:::5837129:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6617495:4:::6450234:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6288851:4:::5921889:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5255134:4:::6521661:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6354980:4:::6354980:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6552591:4:::6552591:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6242691:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6588100:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6452385:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5723893:4:::5723893:4:::6472468:4:::6472468:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5620008:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5816422:4:::5241613:4:::5241613:4:::5373680:4:::6219525:4:::6219525:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5714912:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Brio Sampo the Dog::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::09.02.2008::::    Ahh its cute this little wooden toy dog that is made by Brio has been around for many years 1945 saw the first one of these toys.Let me describe this toy. Sampo dog stands on a red base. He stands 5 inches tall. Sampo is a shiny black dog with yellow feet these are fixed to the base. Sampo s legs are made of 2 beads each these are threaded together and to his feet with I think it s a strong string like thread His body is one black bead shaped a little to resemble a dog s body the legs are threaded onto the body. There are 3 black beads threaded to make the tail this is threaded into the body and out the head end, there is a black bead to represent the neck then a head shaped black bead this has two beady eyes and two red floppy ears. In total there are 19 parts to Sampo dog.Now the base circle of the base moves if you press it and guess what so does Sampo. He flops about and performs contours ions of his body when the base is pushed. His body made relaxed or taught by pressing the circular button base of the toy upwards. This movement slackens the strings, and makes Sampo move.Sampo is quite fun an adult will find it amusing for a short while pressing it a few times to see Sampo do different contortions. This toy is suitable for a child aged 3 year and upwards I think a 4, 5, 6 year old will find it most fun.Apart from fun this will help a child perfect their fine motor skills, it will teach about cause and reaction. Basically this is just a fun toy. Some children will obviously find it more fun than others. . Sampo is a Brio toy and well made should last quite a long time.Sampo costs    5.99 that about 8.99 euros at http://www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk/toys/brio-3 1912.asp    5.99p is the R.R.

The rabbit can be made to move head mouth and arms.Now the thing that is so great about this rabbit is its hiding in a lettuce about 5 soft green leaves are around the rabbit and the rabbit can be made to hide in the lettuce and then pop out.Each of the lettuce leaves has a small price of Velcro which holds it back when you are not using the puppet and if you peel back a leaf you will find a mini beast finger puppet. There are 6 finger puppets a bee, a slug, 2 caterpillars, a ladybird, a butterfly. These are good puppets quite lifelike. These are also mostly made of a fur fabric.These puppets will fit a small adult hand and fingers; they are not too big to swamp a Childs hand. They are soft and comfortable to put on a hand. When you pop the rabbit out of the lettuce this toy measures 13 inches tall. The finger puppets are a good size too will fit onto my little finger maybe just onto some of the others. The finger puppets fit onto a child s finger they are not too big so they fall off.This rabbit is suitable for imaginary play and will help/motivate a child to develop movement in their fingers. (We use glove puppets at school for this with pupils who have little movement in their hands.). This toy is also made of a lovely feeling fur and the leaves are sponge , so it is good as a tactile toy to awaken senses. This rabbit can be used as a prop at story time. It will help develop a child s imagination and story telling.. My grandson 5 enjoyed playing with it my granddaughter too she at two maybe a little young for it but she was happy with rabbit on her hand and jumped the rabbit around. I think she will grow into this toy.  This is a lovely toy. Now the price    This puppet costs    22.50 thatsapprox 32.85EUR |  43.88 from otherworld from Amazon I note it s available from 320.95 at http://www.dandelionhomeandgifts.com/index.php?main=prod id=85 this toy cost    19.95. expensive maybe but you are getting 6 finger puppets and the rabbit in lettuce hand puppet To be honest this is just such a gorgeous toy looks fantastic feels wonderful, no one could resist putting their hand into this puppet and playing with it. Oh go on you know you really want to play with this toy .     ::::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5445547:3:::5522492:3:::5719918:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5633146:4:::6450234:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6242691:4:::6288851:4:::6452385:4:::5921889:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5620008:4:::6140875:4:::6140875:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6368847:4:::6368847:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5473058:4:::6378906:4:::6603580:4:::6603580:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5542565:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6588100:4:::6601458:4:::6601458:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6461332:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5439461:4:::5296797:4:::5296797:4:::5840413:4:::5840413:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5373680:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5714912:4:::6212982:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5335750:4:::5770793:4:::5770793:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Fuzzy Felt Thomas And Friends Tin::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::03.02.2008::::    If you were born post 1950 then you probably will have played with fuzzy felt. This is when fuzzy felt was launched. The idea and design came from Lois Adams who in the second hand war used her farms outbuildings to make felt for gaskets for tanks. Lois created snippets of felt into shapes for the children of the workers to play with. This developed into fuzzy felt the children s toy.Fuzzy felt is recommended for children 3 and over. There have been and are many sets /designs of fuzzy felt, the one I am telling you about today is the Thomas and friends fuzzy felt tin box.The fuzzy felt set comes in a blue tin. The tin has pictures embossed onto it. I think it is useful to have a tin for fuzzy felt keeps the product in good order,Inside the tin are two fuzzy felt boards. There are laminated characters pieces of Thomas and his friend s .There are masses of silhouette felt shapes for scenery to make up a story board/ picture of Thomas. The fuzzy felt scenery comes pre-cut from 6 sheets   of felt they have to be pressed out before use.Once you have the fuzzy felt pieces ready they can be positioned anywhere on the felt boards that come with the set the fuzzy felt pieces will attach themselves to the board. Your child can hold the board up to show you and the pieces will not fall of easily they stay on due to the fuzziness of the felt. If your child wants to move a piece of felt then its easy all he has to do is pick it off the board and move it.Your child can develop his/her imagination by creating a scene for Thomas and his friends. The pictures can be created and changed so easily.  Your child can be absorbed for a long time playing /creating with fuzzy felt. It s a good quiet toy to take visiting. Encourage your child to tell you about the picture they are creating.  Develop their speech and language skills. This toy is also good for developing fine motor skills. There are several others   of these fuzzy felt collection tins available, a Noddy one, one for Rupert the bear. [Postman Pat, fireman Sam, so if your child is not a Thomas fan they may like one of the other tins,Fuzzy felt is a long lasting toy very durable, suitable for both home and child care /school situations. These tins are great for school as they are a better way to keep the fuzzy felt. The Thomas and friends tin is available from http://www.toysrus.co.uk/Product.aspx/TruOrFindUsing/TruAZOfBrands/TruLea rningFuzzyFelt/031992  for    9.99. At Amazon it s available from    4.99p. Look around you can buy Thomas and his friends collectors tin at many other places too.Have fun playing with your children and making fuzzy felt pictures of Thomas the train and his friend.

       " '5247778::::Fimo Clay::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::01.02.2008::::    FimoEberhard Faber makes a range of art craft products they are a member of the German STAEDTLER group. One of the products they make is Fimo. Fimo is modelling clay. I can remember my teenage daughter really enjoying making trinkets and jewellery from Fimo and I was in a sop recently and saw some for sale and it brought back memories.  First your young children will use playdoh or plastercine as a modelling medium. If your child develops an interest and  skill in clay modelling they will enjoy using fimo .  Fimo can be moulded into shapes or rolled out flat and a cutter used to make a flat shape, I have several fimo Christmas tree decorations. There are lots of good cutters at http://www.fullmoons-cauldron.co.uk/pmctexturesandshapedcutters.htm. The finished product looks good glazed.Adults will also like to use fimo as a modelling clay the finished products can look very professional. Fimo is often used to make dolls by hobbyists Fimo is Polymer clay, in recent years Fimo has been revamped. These clays are soft; the newer clays softer than the original fimo clays, apparently doll makers find it a little too soft. I just read that the clays that have to be fired at 130 degrees have now been discontinued and the ones that are available now have to be fired at 110 degrees C. . There is Fimo clay called  Fimo Classic  with 24 colours in the range. The newer  Fimo Soft  has 48+ colours.  The range of colours is so wide. Fimo soft is easy to use its soft and can be moulded into many things. It then has to be baked in a hot oven 110degrees C. If you use higher temperature it will burn and blacken.. My daughter made many little models and lots of jewellery; some of it is still around 15-20 years later.There are lots of ideas for what to make at http://staedtler.co.uk/project_ideas_uk.Staedtler?ActiveID=23852.You can buy fimo in multi packs for starters, or you can buy small kits with several different coloured fimo clays and instructions on how to make the object. There for example you can buy a kit to make a teddy bear, a farm animal and a monster kit there are jewellery packs with the addition of the jewelery fittings. These costs around    4.00 see http://www.handyhippo.co.uk/s263-1-Fimo-Kits.html for several kits.Fimo clay is available from http://www.polymerclaypit.co.uk/acatalog/Fimo_The Classic Block Standard block (56g) - these cost    1.55, Miniblock (15g) costs-    0.60Large Blocks (350g) cost    6.95  The soft fimo block costsStandard block (56g) -    1.55Miniblock (14g) -    0.60. Also available is a starter set and a doll set.Fimo clay can also be bought in craft shops or departments of big stores. Fimo is not suitable for under threes they will be better with playdoh but children aged 8 and upwards will find craft /model/ jewellery making rewarding with this product.Thanks for reading Mary     ::::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5719918:4:::5085573:4:::6450234:4:::5633146:4:::6242691:4:::5473058:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5522492:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5826736:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6378906:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5770793:4:::5770793:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5295459:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5646482:4:::6452385:4:::5416378:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5774361:4:::5774361:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6535491:4:::5439461:4:::6292861:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5476711:4:::5476711:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5296797:4:::5296797:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5620008:4:::6588100:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6471685:4:::6471685:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5816422:4:::6522551:4:::6522551:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6320657:4:::6320657:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6239059:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5335750:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6202288:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Coneflower::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::27.01.2008::::    Cone flower.One of the things I like to do of a winters eve is to look in gardening catalogues  both on and off line, to plan /dream and order my garden plants for the next year. I saw on the pages some plants called Cone flowers. I think I shall order and plant some of these this year. The cone flowers, Echinacea are a member of the Aster, Asteraceae family. Sometimes the cone flower gets called Rudbeckia There are several different coloured varieties one the Echinacea Purpurea, The most common one the purple flowered one Magnus, this has an orange centre, there is a white flowered one  white lustre, Echinacea. Tennesseensis is a mauve coloured petal with greenish yellow centres. There is a yellow flowered one too. You may know one of the yellow ones as black eyed Susan. There are several other cone flowers coloured a range of whites yellows pink reds orange and purples. I shall choose a purple red coloured one for my garden.Cone flowers can be bought as a tall variety or a dwarf variety.  The tall varieties grow 3 to 4 foot/l 90 to 120 cm tall. The dwarf ones grow 12 to18 inches 30-45 cm tall. I shall probably but a few tall ones and a few shorter ones.The flower looks like a daisy the daisy species   belongs to the Asteracea family too. The common name cone flower comes from the centre of the flower which his slightly cone shaped.Around the central cone radiate the coloured petals. Some of the cone flowers have single row of petals others double. The erinacea purpurea has flowers 2-4 inches wide. The stem will sprout several branches which will have a flower at the top. The flowers bloom from July through to SeptemberThe flowers are good as cut flowers for the house. The green leaves grow all the way up the stem they  are a sort of oval shape with jagged /toothed edges.This plant can be bought at garden centres as a plant usually costs    2-   5, or you can grow from seed. This plant likes a well drained soil in a sunny position, it is a hardy plant. A perennial that will last several years.One of the reasons I have chosen this plant is that it is reported to attract butterflies and insects to the flower. Generally I prefer to grow native plants in my garden but this plant originates from North America. I record the sightings of butterflies in my garden for Butterfly Conservation so I will be able to find out if this plant does attract them. Enjoy your garden this year, I am dreaming of warm sunny days in my flower filled one.     ::::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5646482:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5522492:3:::6754009:4:::6754009:4:::5719918:4:::5085573:4:::5633146:4:::5171853:4:::5171853:4:::6450234:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5335750:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6243305:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5921889:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5826736:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5657574:4:::5657574:4:::6253630:4:::6253630:4:::6452385:4:::5774361:4:::5774361:4:::6288851:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5416378:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6461332:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6601932:4:::6601932:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5584168:4:::6588100:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5805660:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5620008:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6242691:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5816422:4:::6292861:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5439461:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5297958:4:::5297958:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6239059:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Brio Stacking Clown::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.01.2008::::    Brio stacking clown. I have played with this toy for many years and thought it was about time I reviewed it. I just checked a few details on line and was amazed to find that Brio have been making this stacking clown toy since 1953  (Or some form of it). I knew that I have played with it for most of my career working with children but had not realised it was available a year before I was born.There are many stacking toys available to buy. The reason why this stacking clown is still made by Brio is that it is a really good stacking toy for children to play with.  The Brio Stacking clown has 9 pieces. There is a circular yellow base from the centre of which sticks up a pole. There are 5 brightly coloured, fairly thick disks of varying circumferences which have a hole in the centre these fit onto the pole. These discs can be put onto the pole in any order. If your child puts these on in the correct size order (green, black, red blue, yellow) it will make the clowns body which has a slightly (larger tummy middle disk) than the base or top. Next put the red thin disk onto the pole this represents the clown s neck ruff. Then there is a round bead with a cheerful face on it this clowns head, onto the clowns head to top of the pole put the conical clowns hat. This conical hat has a red rim and the cone part is yellow.  When all the pieces are together the stacking clown stands 230mm/9 inches high.As you can imagine since this is a Brio toy this is made from wood. The wood is coloured in a safe way. Which is essential as this toy will be played with while your child will still be at that stage of putting everything in their mouth. While researching a few details about this toy on line I read that in 1997 Brio recalled this toy and  redesigned and replaced its hat  due to a child reportedly choking on it .I found this info at .  http://www.recall-warnings.com/cpsc-content-98-98024.html.  Choking on small parts is always a hazard with small children, watch your children while they are playing with tiny pieces and for those at the nothing everything stage do not leave then unattended with small toys .  The educational benefits of this toy are good. It will help develop your child s motor skills, will help develop their grasp. Will help develop hand eye co-ordination. This toy will help sequencing skills, sorting which piece comes next. You can use the colours to begin colour and name recognition, say the name of the colours as your child puts them on.  You/your child can have fun making the clown funny by putting the bricks in different places,  whoever heard of a clown with a face on his tummy dear, let s put his head at the top dear. This toy is more interesting to a child rather than just a plain stacking cone as it has the fun of being a clown and having a face.You can buy this toy from    9.99 from  http://www.amazon.co.uk/BRIO-30120-Wooden-Toys-Stacking/dp/B00004T19T 14, 95  The Us Amazon from http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004T19T?smid=A154Z3BZB2CCWS tag=dealtime-toys-m p-20 linkCode=asn.  14.95From http://www.activetoy.co.uk/product.php?id=1540 it cost    9.99 this company promise to price matchBrio makes good toys.  The Stacking clown will last many, many play hours. It us a toy that will last several children s playtimes, if you have it at home for your child/ren, I expect it will be in good enough condition to pass or sell on .(remember if you have a pre 1997 one check the head brio will probable still change it for you)Remember have fun playing with your children and their toys playing and having fun is a good way to learn .     ::::5435149:3:::5435149:3:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5476711:4:::5476711:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6288851:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5522492:4:::6239669:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5921889:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5784644:4:::5335750:4:::5454586:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5620008:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::21963:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::5646482:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6413554:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6406069:4:::6406069:4:::5584168:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5797317:4:::5797317:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5020702:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6476250:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5439461:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6452385:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Fisher-Price Dance Baby Dance - Classical Stacker::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::20.01.2008::::    Ohhh sparkly stars. These sparkly stars are cute. This toy is a good interactive educational toy that will make a baby smile and laugh. This toy will encourage baby to use his/her motor skills. Basically this toy is a plastic yellow pole on a base.  There are 4 chunky sparkly twinkling stars. The stars are also made out of plastic. There are 4 stars graded in size a blue one, a red one, a green one and a yellow one. These stars are quite thick and are textured. There is a yellow star that fits at the top of the pole this has a cheerful face on it. Children respond well to facial features the eyes, nose and mouth, there are also some rosy cheeks on the star face too. When the first star is put on it passes over a small button on the side of the pole this triggers a light sparkling and a sound. Your child will fit the other stars on the pole and the last star on the top when this is positioned twinkle, twinkle little star is played and the toy will rock from side to side very slightly rewarding your Childs success.  This toy needs 3 AA batteries to make it work.This stacking toy is suitable for a baby from about 6 months, obviously you will have to help them at first and they will put the stars in their mouths, no problem they are safe and easily washed. Your 2 year old should be still interested in this toy and will be able to stack the stars in the correct order. I believe they have one of these in our special needs nursery department the flashing lights and sounds stimulate and encourage learning. Batting and rocking this toy will encourage their gross motor skills, placing the stars onto it will enhance their fine motor skills. The lights and the colourful stars and friendly face will be visually stimulating. The sounds and song will stimulate their auditory. Listening skills. Stacking the stars will encourage problem solving. It will help baby learn about size and colour. Do talk to baby naming the coloured stars. This is a fisher price toy and fisher price toys are well made and designed they last a long time. This toy costs    9.95 it is available from www.johnlewis.com and at most other placesWould I recommend this toy? . Yes I would for a young baby ,a baby gets older he will want something more challenging.     ::::5633146:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5522492:4:::21963:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6288851:4:::5719918:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6450234:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6465383:4:::5921889:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6239669:4:::5255134:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5416378:4:::5646482:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5843359:4:::6601932:4:::6601932:4:::5584168:4:::6242691:4:::5244087:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5774361:4:::5774361:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6224127:4:::5415714:4:::5362774:4:::5241292:4:::5241292:4:::6452385:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5439461:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5743196:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6320657:4:::6320657:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::PHB Jigsaw Shapes::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::15.01.2008::::    A puzzle at my work place. We have the jigsaw shape puzzle by PHB at my school.  This puzzle is a wooden inset puzzle with 12 pieces. Each piece and corresponding hole to position it into is a geometric shape. There is sometimes one of a shape sometimes two of the same shape but they are different sizes, there s circles, squares, rectangles triangle, hexagon, pentagon, semicircle. The puzzle tray is a natural wood colour; each wooden shape is a different colour. This puzzle is quite a large one sorry I did not measure it at work but it must be about12 inches/30cm by9 inches/23cm possibly a bit bigger. The individual shapes about 2 inch pieces. These wooden shape puzzle pieces do not have pegs on to aid their fitting.This puzzle is good to help the learning of shapes and their quantities.  Sit with your child while they are doing the puzzle and help your child name the shapes correctly as they fit them. Do remember to praise your child for correct naming and positioning. These shapes are also big enough to use as templates to draw round to make shape pictures.This puzzle suitable for a child aged 2 and over My nearly 2 year old granddaughter can do simple inset puzzles although maybe a few too many pieces in this one for her also shapes she is not familiar with by the age of 3 she will be able to fit all 12 into the puzzle and name a few shapes she already knows circle and triangle.. It is good for children s motor control to fit puzzle pieces practising fitting pieces in place. Also good practice for hand eye co-ordination. I am sure several other play and nursery groups will have this puzzle. I work in a special needs school and we use this and other puzzles helps develop concentration as well as the other skills. This puzzle and others like it would be good for home use. Will help your child and be a quiet activity to do. Do encourage your child to sit and do quiet activities like puzzles at home. This puzzle is available from Amazon for    5..99p.  I expect work bought it through an educational supplier though . This puzzle is fairly robust and will wipe over with soapy water if needing a clean. Yes I would recommend it as a tool to helping your child learn their shapes . Have fun playing  with your children s toys I know they will , Mary     ::::5646482:3:::6601932:3:::6601932:3:::5719918:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5633146:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6239669:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::21963:4:::6471685:4:::6471685:4:::6292861:4:::6450234:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5577439:4:::6288851:4:::5244087:4:::5774361:4:::5774361:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5415714:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6242691:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6452385:4:::6243305:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6599475:4:::6599475:4:::5439461:4:::5620008:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5066197:4:::5066197:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5645431:4:::5645431:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6603737:4:::5416378:4:::6239059:4:::5816422:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5584168:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Co-op Chocolate Coins::::Food & Drink::::30::::helpful::::12.01.2008::::    Co op chocolate coins. I think most people will have consumed a few chocolate coins in their lives. Chocolate coins are made and sold by many companies. They are ideal to add as chocolate stocking filler or use as a cake decoration. I gave my children at school some chocolate coins this year I bought them in the Co-op. The chocolate coins were in a yellow/gold net bag and contained 12 coins all the same size. Sorry I forgot the price but I remember they were well under a pound a bag. Can not find price info on line. . These chocolate coins were wrapped individually in a  gold foil wrapper; the gold coins were German coins.   Deuchemarks   with the German eagle imprinted on the foil, I think these are like the commemorative coins that denote the last Deutschmarks in 2001. Now I believe all real coins are Euros. Now to the taste.~~~~~ Often I find the chocolate in coins and decoration inferior tasting nasty. Before you taste smell the aroma of food gets the gastric juices flowing , this chocolate coinn smells only a little it smells chocolatly    surprise .. While this chocolate coins not the best tasting Belgium or Cadbury chocolate it is ok. It s a MILK chocolate a bit like a cooking chocolate. The taste is not so nice that I want 2 though (which is good as I am sure they are calorific)So not bad but not really a winner on taste to me, Still the kids wont be so discerning.I hope the Tesco ones I bought for the family tasted better     ::::5719918:3:::6609678:3:::5633146:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::6212039:3:::6212039:3:::21963:3:::6185895:3:::6185895:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5774361:3:::5774361:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5374295:3:::5374295:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5353630:3:::5353630:3:::5687589:3:::5687589:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::6231301:3:::6231301:3:::6288851:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::6436251:3:::6436251:3:::5244087:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5646051:3:::5646051:3:::5620008:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5693422:3:::5693422:3:::6217853:3:::6217853:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5584168:3:::5522492:3:::6390594:3:::6390594:3:::5647565:3:::5647565:3:::5000330:3:::5000330:3:::5364984:3:::5364984:3:::6242691:3:::5828346:3:::5828346:3:::5809210:3:::5809210:3:::5750745:3:::5750745:3:::6320657:3:::6320657:3:::6591498:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5439461:3:::5349776:3:::5349776:3:::9879:3:::9879:3:::6239059:3:::5816422:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6450234:4:::5577439:4:::6452385:4:::5921889:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6322806:4:::6322806:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Crawfords Gariboldi Biscuits::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::10.01.2008::::    Crawford garibaldi biscuits,Is that a dead fly in your biscuit, no dear it s a currant a bit squashed. There are several currants squashed in a Garibaldi biscuit..The garibaldi biscuit was created by the English. It was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi to honour the Italian general who led the fight to unify Italy.   Last year 2007 is the bicentenary of the birth of Giuseppe Garibaldi. (July 4, 1807 - June 2, 1882. Giuseppe Garibaldi visited London in 1864  A make of garibaldi biscuits that I like is Crawford s, or united biscuits as Crawford s sold out to united biscuits in the 1960 s. .{{  I have read on various web sites that the first garibaldi biscuit made by Crawford s was in 1813 in Leith, Edinburgh since 1 Garibaldi was born in 1807 I doubt that the biscuit named after a 9 year old.  I suspect it was a different name then later called Garibaldi. The Peak Freans in London made a garibaldi biscuit in 1861.  I suspect that it might have something to do with the recruitment of John Carr a great biscuit maker of Scotland }}  Crawford s garibaldi biscuits are sold in a packet containing 100grams of biscuit. The pack is a dark red colour with the Crawford s logo the name garibaldi and a picture of a few garibaldi biscuits. Opening the packet there are several layers of these biscuits these biscuits are usually still linked together you have to break them apart.  Pullout the top biscuit it is a thin flat rectangular biscuit a golden colour these biscuits have a high glaze. You will notice it is speckled a few raisins which have bursting out of the biscuit. This biscuit has been made with the currant filling sprinkled onto one layer this then has obviously folded over and the currants make a central filling. I imagine this biscuit then flattened by a roller and squashing those poor currants, hence making them looks like dead flies. The biscuits are so thin that the raisins burst through the top and the bottom. I have seen many children picking these dead flies (currants) out and eating them with relish. The biscuits are a crispy texture but the currants make them slightly soft.These biscuits taste sweet you can taste the curranty flavour throughout the biscuit. These biscuits contain 33  currants they are not suitable for those with allergies to wheat flour, and milk. These biscuits may contain sesame seeds. One biscuit contains 40 calories. Full ingredients are available at http://www.abitofhome.ca/page/C1/PROD/5041403You can buy a packet of these biscuits for about 70p in most supermarkets.. I found a garibaldi biscuit recipe in line so if you prefer to make your own rather than buy a packet of Crawford s garibaldi biscuits go to http://www.hookerycookery.com/biscuit003.htm. The date on the front page says the first garibaldi biscuit made in 1813, I also found this info at Bebo.com, but I also found that it was first made 1864 according to yahoo.com Enjoy your dead fly biscuits, Mary     ::::6448877:4:::5433642:4:::5476711:4:::5476711:4:::5633146:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6450234:4:::5335750:4:::6452385:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6288851:4:::6322806:4:::6322806:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6242691:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5244087:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6601932:4:::6601932:4:::6212039:4:::6212039:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5843359:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::21963:4:::5719918:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5921889:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6461332:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5624348:4:::5624348:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5720884:4:::5720884:4:::6604409:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6603737:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5349776:4:::5349776:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5328942:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5289059:4:::5289059:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5816422:4:::6458724:4:::6458724:4:::5584168:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6521661:4:::5373984:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6588100:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Fisher-Price First Blocks::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::05.01.2008::::    We have the fisher price first blocks that appear in the category picture here at work in the early year s department. There are many shape sorters (which this toy really is) available. This one by fisher price is a good one.This toy is made of a good durable plastic. It is a soft plastic not brittle that will snap. It is easy to wash and clean.Now let me describe these fisher price first shapes, shape sorter. It is not shaped as a post box as many shape sorters are but is a lower flatter shape a rectangular tub with a lid which the holes to post shapes are cut out of. This toy. Has a good strong blue carry handle.The tub itself is a bright red colour. This then has a fisher price product sticker on it. The lid to the shape sorter is yellow. This fits on well. In the lid are 5 shape holes square circle triangle rectangle and a star .The lid does not have clips which baby can not undo to fit it and can be taken off fairly easily. There are 10 shapes that come with this toy 2 for each shape hole. These are smooth shapes that baby will try to put in his /her mouth and they do not have sharp edges. Also they are too big to get in babies mouth and for him /her to swallow. This toy is a safe toy.Age ~~~~~A shape sorter is an ideal toy for a baby from about 6 months old upper age 3 years old depending on your Childs development.Play value and benefits.~~~~~Your very young baby will enjoy learning about the shapes their texture their properties just by mouthing them, holding them in his/her hand feeling them. The first way baby learns is through touch. Baby will then place the shapes move them from one place to another. Before baby can actually fit the shapes take the lid of and let baby just place the shapes in the tub then baby can take them out again and begin all over again. make this fun by talking to baby making sounds as the bricks plop into the tub , clap your hands praise baby , yes they are learning .As baby progresses she/ he will be able to place the shapes in the correct place s maybe not easily at first but with a little help will turn them around so that the shapes fit. Soon baby will learn which shapes fit in which holes.If your child is having difficulty putting the correct shapes in the correct holes help them point or tap the correct hole you can help them by doing it hand over hand together too.We use shape sorters such as these with the special needs children I work with, I just found an excellent site with advice about play with object related play using shape sorters at http://books.google.com/books? id=FhQwmxJSpKAC pg=PA53 lpg=PA53 dq= posting+toys source=web ots= V3BnkvX6T sig=4KwYzzEjN7lI _FchkG5TZ1G6ww PPA54,M1.This toy is a good toy to play with baby and baby will be able to occupy themselves a few moments playing with this toy. Grasping and positioning the blocks in the sorter will help your child practice their motor skills. They will stimulate your child s visual awareness placing and positioning.While baby is  playing with it you can help increase their vocabulary by saying in out and naming the shapes setting them on the way to early geometry, maths learning shape and their qualities. You can also count the shapes as they go into the pot.When the game is over its tidying up time baby will help put the blocks back in the tub. This tub will fit in the toy box better than that post-box round shaped ones I think. Other uses ,I posted this review on the other side and was reminded  by the Ex raven that these shapes are also good for printing, dipping into paint and printing onto paper . Essentially~~~~~I think this is a good toy not too many shape holes easy for baby to hold and master. Easy to clean, A great way of learning for baby.The price ~~~~~   7.99 from http://www.kiddicare.com/webapp/wcs/stores/ servlet/productdisplayA_319_10751_-1__6585_10001_   5.97 sale price at http://www.toysrus.com/ 8 at http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx? st=10 e=storeproduct pid=38691  9.99 at http://www.toysrus.comI am sure that you can find this toy in a toy department. If not this one then another shape sorter, I do know from experience that this fisher price first blocks is a good one.

Info for those of you who didn t know. Lego is a toy building system. It links together with little studs in each brick. Lego is a Danish toy company founded in 1932v making step ladders, ironing boards. And children s toys.

Watch out here come the police in the little tikes  patrol police car, its been driven by a 4 year old the police man could be between the age of 1 and 5 as it will be big enough inside for them.  There is only room for one patrol officer in this car and no space for prisoners behind him. This police patrol car is a version of the cosy coupe you often see children driving around in these cars from little tikes are very popular in childcare settings This car is ideal for the playground or inside in a large space. I did see one at toddler s world at the leisure centre in Dunstable. As you might imaginer this car is made out of plastic coloured blue with the word police on the doors (there are 2). There is a roof over the top of the car it is not an open vehicle. (Ideal little Johnny then can play outside in the rain he will not get too wet.) On top of the roof are the blue police lights This police car is foot powered scooted along as fast as your child can go. So ideal for those with no peddling skills. NNE NAA .When the child pushesthe button on the electronic microphoneelectronic sounds are heard. Also the blue lights flash. This does need 2  AA batteries so when you get fed up with the noise the battery can always run out.This toy is very easy to clean when it gets dirty yes I would recommend it if you have somewhere your child can ride it. Measurements 82cm L   x   44cm W   x   82cm H. you can buy this toy for    54.95 from http://www.littletikes.co.uk it is about    10.oo  more expensive than the cosy coupe I wrote ABOUT IN 2003. You could buy from Woolworths for    49, 99, and from mail order express its    49.99 too, save a few p its    49.95 from john Lewis. Would I recommend? Yes I have seen many children enjoying playing in this version of the cosy coupe.

       " '5247778::::Christmas Rose Helleborus Niger::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::21.12.2007::::    The Christmas rose Helleborus Niger is not a rose as we know it from the family Rosaceae, but it is a hellebore from the Ranunculus (buttercup family.) This plant is one of the few plants that flower in the winter time to cheer our souls.LEGEND ~~~~~ There is a legend that a young shepherd girl seeing the wise men and shepherds taking gifts to the baby Jesus found a flower blooming through the snow and took it to the stable as her gift to the Christ child. Apparently you should plant /put a Christmas rose by the door to let Christ into your house.Flowering time~~~~~~~~~~This plant will flower anytime from December to April. Often flowering and getting confused with the Lenten rose Hellorborous. Orientalis which tends to flower just as winter is endingWhat it looks like.~~~~~~~~~~ The Christmas rose grows 12-15 inches30cm-50cm tall. It has shiny leathery dark green leaves. Its flowers are white tinged with pink flower. The stalk bears a single flower. The flower is about2 to 4 inches/5cm-10cm in diameter50. The flower is shaped like a bowl and has 5 petals. Inn the centre of the flower the yellow stamens are quite long making an attractive centre to the flower Growing.~~~~~~~~~The Christmas rose is a native of central and southern Europe. It is fairly easy to grow in the garden.  Plant in the garden in early spring. They need partial shade, which gives sunlight in the winter months. The soil most suited is deep, fertile, moist but with drainage. Give the soil lots of humus before planting the Christmas rose. The roots (poisonous) planted downwards into the soil the crown (where roots meet stem) about an inch below the soil. Put some mulch around the top of the soil around the crown. You can grow Christmas rose from seed but they take a few years to bloom.  Caring for. ~~~~ If growing indoors keep in a cool position and water when soil dry to the touch.

       " '5247778::::Sweet Chestnut Tree::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::14.12.2007::::    Sweet chestnut.  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, sorry I got carried away singing that old song it made me think of sweet chestnuts which many people will be roasting and eating this Christmas time .. This chestnut is the Sweet chestnut Castanea sativa not the horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum... The sweet chestnut tree is not as common in England as the horse chestnut, Although the Sweet chestnut has been here for very many years it is not a native of England but it is believed it ids a Spanish native brought to Britain by the Romans. Sometimes sweet chestnuts are called Spanish chestnuts. I have been to Spain and seen forests of sweet chestnut trees. In England there are sweet chestnut trees in the forests and woods and sometimes found in parks or in the verges by the side of roads. What is a sweet chestnut tree?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The sweet chestnut tree is a large tree, 20-30 metres tall, a bit large for a modern garden.The thick trunk will have barked that has deep grooves spirally running vertically (good for bark rubbings.)    The wood is used for furniture.~~. The leaves are long have serrated edges and are very tough.  The tree looses its leaves in October November as it is deciduous,~~The sweet chestnut has both male and female flowers in June July time these are both in the catkins which stand upright 10-20 cms long. The female flowers when fertilized will develop in to the nut.~~ The nut of the sweet chestnut is edible not like the conker from the horse chestnut. The nut is encased in a prickly spiky green brown coat.  This spiky case is removed to find the edible nut that is encased in a protective shell/skin. It is a shiny brown with a flat side. The edible nut is inside this skin. The nut is a yellowy creamy wrinkles nut it is not edible however till it is cooked.  The nut should be ready to harvest October November time but English grown chestnuts may not be fully mature as they need sun, sun, sun  Chestnuts are often known as Marrons in France and other countries. Eating chestnuts.~~~~~ Chestnuts evoke that romantic image of sitting round the open fire roasting and eating chestnuts autumn and Christmas time.Taste ~~~ Oh I hate describing tastes a little sweet a not very strong flavour it s only a little nutty pleasant~~ Chestnuts are available to buy in shops and markets if you can not find your own in the woods Chestnuts are a starchy food could be an alternative to potatoes. You can roast chestnuts in their skins on your open fire.  Gas hob or electric plate. You can buy special chestnut roasters a bit like a frying pan with holes in it see http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steel-Chestnut-Roaster-Wooden-Handle/dp/B000H7AFUQ they have some for sale from about 6 pounds. You could roast chestnuts in your oven at 400 degree f for about 15 -20 minutes    Or just boil them in a pan of water for about 10 minutesIf you are roasting or cooking the nut in the outer brown skin does pierce it first or you will get some messy explosions.  You can eat the cooked nuts as they are or add them too recipes there are several chestnut recipes at http://www.cooks.com/rec/story/71/ cooks_chestnut_k. Or Delia has a chestnut stuffing recipe at http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/eighteenth-century-chestnut-stuffing,914 ,RC.html. Of course you could just buy some chestnut stuffing or a bag of frozen brussel sprouts with added chestnuts for your Christmas or New Year celebration. It is possible to buy canned chestnuts too. Tesco is selling a variety of chestnut stuffing s from about    1.25 to    2.

       " '5247778::::Playmobil 4133: Super Castle Set::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::12.12.2007::::    My Grandson loves the Play Mobil super castle set that his mummy and daddy bought him for his 5th birthday.This is a plastic toy made to look like a stone fort; there are fortifications around part of the top of the castle. There is a dungeon too. This toy measures 13inches long and 9 inches high.  The toy is not so big it takes over the whole of the living room floor.The castle comes with a variety of extras one which is my grandsons favorite is Big Bertha a cannon that shoots. this cannon ball will guard the castle against all comers and knock them over , it does actually shoot quite a distance and will knock over the toy plastic soldiers My grandson delights in shooting the cannon and putting the   enemy  that he knocks over in the dungeon. We did tell him to make sure he was not firing the cannon at any one, as I could see that being a possible problem. However after telling him once he is a good boy and does not fire the cannon at anyone. There are 4 knights, 2 from opposing armies (different colored tabards.) shields for the soldiers weapons too swords, axes, jousting poles. There are helmets for the soldiers too. Flags to fly, a ladder to put up against the castle wall in the attack. I think my grandson will get a lot of play hours from this toy. This toy will inspire his imaginary play. Adrian will be able to play with this on his own or with his friends. This toy is recommended for children of 4 and over I would say that s about right.  The age ratings on ciao are not quite right for this toy I think 4 to about 6 maybe 7 years would be correct.This Play Mobil super castle set costs    12.95 from John Lewis s,     11 .95 from Sp models 13, 95 from mail order express.  20 .50 is the recommended retail price but it is available for  19.95 at http://www.utoypia.com/moreinfo.php? ID=3530 Name=Playmobil_Super_Sets Play mobile toys are good value they last well and wash easily. This playmobil set should last a long time will not break easily, Adrian may lose the cannon ball somewhere though as he fires it everywhere.    Play Mobil has evolved from a lock and metal fitting company formed in 1876. Hans Beck created the play Mobil figure in the early 1970 s during the oil crisis. The first play Mobil toys were on sale in 1974 and have developed into a really good toy giving hours of pleasure to children.  There are several other sets that will compliment this set extra knights, dragons or even bigger castles. The cannon is available on its own for about    8.00. Would I recommend this toy? Yes.     ::::5773758:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::5522492:3:::5646482:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6520091:4:::6322806:4:::6322806:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6288851:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5244087:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5921889:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6452385:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6450234:4:::6242691:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6588863:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6557505:4:::5416378:4:::5584168:4:::6581111:4:::5843359:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo: Green Duplo Baseplate::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::10.12.2007::::    I play with Lego duplo building plate s identical to this nearly every day; we have some at work, and guess what I have some at home for the grandchildren to build on.. Lego duplo is a really good construction toy and when your child is making a building these base plates are good for added stability and a firm base to build on. Lego duplo is suitable for children aged 3 -5 years old, but this really depends on their maturity, development and skills I have known under threes play happily with duplo and over 5 s play with it too. Duplo helps develop your child s gross and fine motor skills; these plates being different colours are attractive and can help colour recognition.These base plates come in a set of 3, a red one a blue one a green one. Each of these base plates are 6 studs by 9 studs 54 studs in total. These plates are big enough for placing duplo bricks on side by side building a boat maybe or making a tower, let your Childs imagination run riot. A word of warning you may not be able to recognise the identity of the finished construction. Ask your child about it rather than saying that are a lovely house when really in your Childs mind it may be a swimming pool There are larger Lego duplo base plates available too but these smaller ones are fine  especially for the younger age range.Duplo helps develop your child s gross and fine motor skills; these plates being different colours are attractive and can help colour recognition.Lego Duplo is a strong plastic well constructed it will last many many playhours  , if when your child grows out of it you keep it  your next generation will play with it . I kept duplo from 25 years ago and my grandchildren now play with it. Duplo base plates are easy to clean just wash them in warm water with a preferred detergent or disinfectant (babies love to mouth everything and pass on their germs) These base plates are not too expensive RRP    3.99. They are available at a lot of toy stores and on line. The Lego store http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=2198 has them available. Amazon has a store selling them for    1.99p. You will have to pay    4 at http://www.toys-express.co.uk/acatalog/Bricks.html. These building plates would make a good addition to any child duplo toy collection. Have good play value and, long levity, if you see them cheap second hand they are likely to be in a good condition. Thanks for reading; off to work now to play with this toy, I love my work playing with toys all day     shame about the children being there too   61514;     ::::5435149:3:::5435149:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6322806:4:::6322806:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5522492:4:::5565496:4:::6588100:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5416378:4:::6591498:4:::6288851:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5620008:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6589491:4:::6589491:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6145850:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6450234:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5207685:4:::5207685:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6526351:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5843359:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5743196:4:::5921889:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5244087:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5441577:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6242691:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6594702:4:::5454586:4:::5584168:4:::6569579:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6378505:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6588863:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Toyday Wooden Animal Castanet::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::08.12.2007::::    Wooden castanet tobar A toy /musical instrument that I have played with at work is the wooden lady bird animal castanet, What is this castanet?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This castanet is a wooden toy. This castanet is made of  two  small circles of wood measuring  5     cm in diameter. This toy  is painted a bright ladybird/Christmas red  there is a black line dividing the wooden circle. ( to represent wings). On the red wood either side of this line are 3 black dots.There is  a black face area with two white and black eyes on one edge of the circles.  This re[presents a lady bird/bug. The two wooden circles are tied together by a piece of elasticised red string. This casternet is chunky fits into a childs hand well This is a very bright contrasts toy very appealing to a Childs eye. Just discovered you can buy a green frog castanet or a yellow duck one he same manufacturer and design except the frog and duck have protruding eyes. Suitability ~~~~This toy is really suitable for a 3 year old and over.How to play a castanet ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This castanet is played by putting the wooden circles open in the palm of one hand, folding your fingers down and clacking the wooden circles together. (Its not as easy as you guys think) Sound~~~~~ The sound made from this castanet is not unpleasant it s a sort tap clicking of wood together.  We use castanets to accompany many songs. Castanets are used a lot in Spanish music.  The castanet is an instrument that is used to give a beat to a song a tapping instead of a drum. You can play a fast or a slow rhythm with a castanet. Benefits of using a castanet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It s not just the music, the rhythm. The castanets not only enhances and enable students to accompany music (ok so often our children need a little help to clack these castanets ) but they are good to encourage hand movements fine and gross motor movements. Some of my special needs children need an incentive to move their fingers and making a sound does give this incentive. Using music and castanets can stimulate speech development. In a group situation you can promoter turn taking and social skills. What s more these brightly coloured castanets are fun to use for any child,   .. go on give your child some clackers in their Christmas stocking.  .This toy/musical instrument  should last quite a long time  as it is fairly basicand sturdy .The castanets I am talking about only cost 99p.  You can buy them from http://www.thelittlehencompany.com/animal-castanet---duck-frog-or-ladybird- 486-p.asp  or 50p from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toyday-Animal-Castanet/dp/B000H6UR7I On eBay    1.25p http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/NEW-Musical-Instruments-Animal-Castanets-Ladybird_W0Q QitemZ140179539493QQihZ004QQcategoryZ101565QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZVie wItem.

It runs at 1.19 kw hours  The wash efficiency is also an A rating the spin however is only a B efficiency rating running at 120 rpm.  This machine is not the best at water consumption using15.85 gal per wash.This machine stands 84.99cm tall is 59.51 cm wide and 57.99in depth. The controls are a dial and there is a digital display. The time remaining for the wash is displayed. The start can be delayed so you can put the wash in and set it to come on when you want it too. There is a quick wash setting and a mini load setting ideal for Dad on his own. The other settings include hand wash and wool wrinkle free and soaking as well as other standard wash settings. This machine is fairly easy to load and unload seems to get the washing clean , the spin is ok however this machine does not have a tumble drier function.

       " '5247778::::Cointreau Liqueur::::Food & Drink::::50::::helpful::::28.09.2002::::    This is the first review I ever wrote for caio read at your peril.Yes this is my favorite tipple. I had a drop or two last night went to the cupboard where I keep it and realised it was my last bottle   Fortunately we are going to France soon and I can buy a few bottles it does work out a little cheaper. Last time I bought some in England it was    14 when we have got my supplies from France I shall update and tell you how much it cost thereCointreau is a clear liquid tasting of oranges; it is a bitter sweet blend of orange peels. Adolphe and Edouard Jean Cointreau developed   Cointreau in Angers France in1849.  Drying orange peel and then macerating them in alcohol for several weeks to bring out the aroma make Cointreau.Chocolate goes wonderfully with cointreau I have had cointreau chocolates given to me as a present wonderful l orange chocolate with that sweet bitter taste.Have recipe if you like chocolate and cointreau, Make your favorite hot chocolate add a little cointreau mmm-hot choc with a buzz warming on a winter night. Cointreau comes in a distinctive brown square bottle very sophisticated or is that because I know what it holds.You can visit the cointreau factory in France, or visit their site on line at wwwcointreau.com  (I do not find this site easy to read because of the colours and size of print they have used) I Think I shall check out where Angers is if it is on route to the Pyrenees I shall visit and try some of their wares.

       " '5247778::::Lego Baby 5463: Play Train::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::25.11.2007::::    Baby s first train.Trains fascinate children and adults alike. Whether it s the fast new trains or the old steam trains which hold that piece of magic. We have train museums, old steam train railways lines and events. There are model railways designed and played with for and by adults. Most of us and our children will have had some sort of train toy during childhood.  Many manufacturers make toy trains. A toy train that I have played with recently alongside a child I hasten to add is the Lego baby train number 5463.Lego Baby is the largest of the Lego range. First available as Lego baby in 2005 It used to be called Lego primo or Duplo primo. These bricks are designed for babies from 6 to 18 months. The train is recommended for children ages 1year and over. These bricks are 4 times the size of duplo eight times ordinary Lego. Lego baby can be used alongside other Lego bricks. To fit these bricks to duplo, adapter bricks are available from LEGO Direct (set 5022).This baby train wieghs: 422 g  boxed I can not find this train for sale on line anywhere Amazon uk say it is not available  but http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0007LXVNU/ref=dp_olp_2/002-6275501- 8547268 it is available at  24 plus postage of    7. I am not sure the train came from that I played with maybe someone had it as a pressie from the U S? This train consists of an engine and two trucks/carriages. First the engine it s a dark green engine which is rounded to look like the boiler of an old steam train. There is a funnel of an orange ball this if depressed will toot like an engine. Behind the boiler is the driver s carriage this has a large rounded knobbly bit that another brick can fit in. A cheerful driver with a red hat is provided to sit in the drivers cab. This engine has 4 bright red wheels.There is a linking piece at the back of the engine which fits with the link on one of the carriages. There are two carriages one is a light green one a blue each one has two knobbles on it and each one has 4 red wheels. Basically it looks just like a large brick with two knobs on and some wheels. Also supplied are 2 bricks which will fit on to the knobs. One brick is yellow and has a picture of a dog on it. One is blue and has a picture of a monkey on it. So come play with me and my baby Lego train set. It is good for little children and those with poor fine motor control as the pieces fit together even easier than duplo. You can fit the pieces together to make the train and play with it. Baby will watch you and want to join in.  Baby will soon grasp how to stick the bricks together.You can push the train along on the wheels see they go round and round ooops baby has knocked the train over. It will not work like that baby it needs to be on its wheels there can you feel the wheels go round and round as I push it along your arm. That s right now baby can push the train too chook, choo.  Baby is practising gross motor skills by pushing the train and placing the bricks  We can practise making sounds as we chug the train around the floor choo choo, peep peep  chhh chh chhh , shhh shhhh shh. Listen to your babies sounds it s the beginning of language copy them its fun, introduce new sounds and baby will soon try to copy them.Look at the lovely colours the train is green that brick is blue. Baby will learn about colours and their names do say the colours when you are playing with baby. Baby will also learn about shapes and size with these brick s when he/she explores them in her/his hands and mouth. Play sorting and matching using these and the other bricks in the baby range. Learning different and the same.Babies love to just move these bricks around putting them into tubs and boxes that s a great game; it s also useful to teach baby how to tidy up.  Lego baby is made of a safe hard plastic all smooth edges no sharp pieces.  The person to get hurt is mum or dad when they walk bare footed over the Lego that baby has not put away .They are too large to swallow when baby puts them in his/her mouth. You can begin to play imaginary games with this train go on a journey to the seaside or to town, use other toys to supplement this to make a play scene. Babies of one and over are beginning to develop an imagination. And play out scenes that they have experienced. Widen your Childs experience so they can understand the train. Go on a train journey one day.  Most important have fun  play with your baby and their toys. Choo choo  chooooo.     ::::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5435149:4:::5435149:4:::5719918:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::6204895:4:::6204895:4:::6397261:4:::6469545:4:::6469545:4:::6224127:4:::6239059:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6588863:4:::6569579:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6212982:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5584168:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6413554:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::6450234:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6288851:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6447607:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5921889:4:::6452385:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5244087:4:::5646482:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6323918:4:::6323918:4:::5335750:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5020702:4:::5454586:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5661865:5:::5661865:5:::6318281:5:::6535491:5:::6378505:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Toyday Smile Drum::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::23.11.2007::::    Smile at this drum,~~~~~~~~~~~This smile drum is one I have played with at work. It may not be what immediately pops into your head as a drum, but this is what it is it s a smile drum. This toy/musical instrument is a bit like a traditional hand mirror in shape. It has a long cylindrical handle with a drum circle at the top. The drum is just a drumming fabric stretched across the circle. The drum has a smiley face printed on it, it measures 20cm across. Young babies and children always respond well to a face on a toy the two eyes and mouth. The smile face printed on this drum is rather appealing. Attached either side to the coloured plastic frame that circles the drumming fabric are two beads that are attached with a piece of string. This drum is made in pink, y yellow, orange, or greenTo play this drum ~~~~~~~~~~ Put the handle of the drum between the palms of your hands and rotatethe handle rapidly. A rum like noise is produced sometimes quite loud.All children love to make a noise. I have used this smile drum with my less able students to get their attention and responses.  Also this smile drum is easy for a child to hold. And make a sound with. Some of my less able pupils have to be assisted hand over hand, the sound does give them the incentive to try and move their hands to make a sound for themselves, so encouraging movement. I think this Smile drum would make super stocking filler for a young child who likes to make a noise. Age suitability .~~~~~~~~ I think this would be fine for a child over the age of 2Price and availability.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This toy is really cheap 50 p you can buy it at http://www.toyday.co.uk/shop/traditional-toys or http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toyday-Smile-Drum/dp/B000H6URU0 has it for 49p. I am sure I saw this for sale in the toy shop in the underground market in Aylesbury. I expect you will find it in other novelty toy shops too.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::5646482:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6450234:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6242691:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::5244087:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5921889:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6413554:4:::5843359:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6576470:4:::6576470:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6325121:4:::6288851:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5584168:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5663139:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6212982:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6239059:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Almer�a (Spain)::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::24.09.2002::::    A pretty cove and a beautiful walk near San Jos    SpainWe went on holiday to San Jos    in Almeria Spain this Easter hols. This is a description of one of the best bays/beaches we found and a good coastal walk.We used the tourist hiking map Capo de Gata-Nijar (1:50.000 same scale as an standard OS map here) which we bought from the tourist information in San Jos   , it comes with an accompanying book about the routes marked on the map. It also contained information about camping, apartments and other local information in Spanish. Dearly beloved can read some Spanish and I found I could follow a lot of the instructions fairly simply, you may be able to get an English copy. I will check this out .We found this a very good map and guide I would certainly recommend it.One morning we set out in our hire car, with a loaf of bread, some cheese, some fruit and some water to Cala el Playazo Map reference 888804, this is about 15k from San Jos   .  I will describe how to get there, first you head east about 12 km from San Jos   /El Pozo de los Frailes to Rodalquila. Then head for Horticheulas and Las Negras, about 2 km out of Rodaquila towards Horticheulas you come to a turning on your right posted Playazo. Now this is more of a farm track than a road. It is possible to take your car down here - slowly. It had rained the night before we went and was very muddy. So, after about 1 km when we passed the ruined Castillo de Rodalquilar, we stopped the car and walked the remaining track. From the road to the cove it was only about 2 km.We came across a small beautiful cove, waves crashing onto the rocks, seabirds calling and with only a couple of cars parked in the parking space. No one on the beach (no bar, no ice creams, no deckchairs). I suspect it gets busier in summer - maybe 8 cars then ? The beach is of the palest sand and behind it there is a small pool of freshwater (or at least there was after the overnight rain) with a palm tree fringe. The water might last as a sign declaring this to be part of the National Parque Gata-Nijar had a  don t disturb the frogs  icon alongside the no fires, no camping, leave the flowers alone symbols. I gazed out to sea listening to the rhythm of the waves, the gulls and the enveloping peace. I could imagine pirates landing their bounty here, secretly, years ago. Then we began the walk behind the Castillo de San Ram   n along the coast path, which was very easy to find, well maintained and quite wide. The vegetation is sparse but it is a beautiful walk up to the top of the cliff. We saw a few butterflies. Not many as it was cloudy: Lang s short tailed blue, Spanish marbled white, swallowtails and whites. Birds we saw included kestrel, raven, avocet and linnet and the astounding trumpeter finch.  However when we got to the top I was slightly nervous (nearly petrified would be more honest -db) and walked very carefully. The cliff was steep and high. I do not like heights but dearly beloved was skipping along gaily chasing butterflies, not a care in the world. He said it was easy,  no problem , but then he doesn t get queasy thinking about going up a ladder. The path is only 2 or 3 km long to where you descend towards a camping site with lots of blue awnings (for shade, the dryness of this area makes trees hard to grow) this is Cala del Cuervo. Where there is a beach of grey gravels and some very impressive cliffs that give protection from the wind. We decided to return by a circular route rather than go back the way we came - and avoid the precipitous drop. After some trouble getting past the camp site fencing we took a track along a dry riverbed where we ate a late lunch and then joined the road, the scenery, flowers and insects along this route were good. At first it was a small country road that joined a more major, but still quiet, road back to Rodalquila. Only 2 or 3 cars passed us. Along the way we saw the various brightly coloured rocks that give the area its name (Cape of Agate in translation) and evidence of small scale mining of the vermilion, scarlet, orange and green rocks. We then found our track back to the place we had left our car.Iwould certainly recomend this walk and the Almeria area in Spain     ::::5393701:3:::5013633:3:::5013633:3:::5066613:3:::5066613:3:::5207843:3:::5243388:3:::5240190:3:::5239203:3:::6470690:4:::6023250:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6413554:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6452385:4:::6556647:4:::6220051:4:::6212982:4:::5620008:4:::6222117:4:::6222117:4:::5676748:4:::5255134:4:::5796458:4:::5332626:4:::5624912:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5565496:4:::5717149:4:::5279552:4:::5719657:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5697579:4:::5697579:4:::5286588:4:::5286588:4:::5020054:4:::5020054:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5020702:4:::5431484:4:::5275540:4:::5244008:4:::20096:4:::775:4:::775:4:::5285637:4:::5246873:4:::18116:4:::5251198:4:::5026776:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::5081075:4:::5186837:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::5066721:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5202792:4:::5085331:4:::8689:4:::5244881:4:::5238961:4:::5238961:4:::5151805:4:::5050869:4:::5241490:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::5208443:4:::5208443:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5066097:4:::5066097:4:::6389:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::5202678:4:::5151822:4:::5151822:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::6189264:5:::6189264:5:::6561342:5:::5314908:5:::5670103:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tobar Metal Harmonica::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::21.11.2007::::    Tobar ltd is a Suffolk company that make and distribute toys and novelties. I was in a shop the other day and bought a harmonica as a present for my grandson. Tobar make both a metal and a wooden harmonica I bought the metal one for    2.99 the wooden one is    3.99,A harmonica is a wind instrument. It has multiple, variably-tuned reeds which are secured at one end over an airway slot in which they can freely vibrate.  Air blown into this slot vibrates the reeds to produce sound. This Tobar metal harmonica is about 95cm long 25 cm wide.  This harmonica is C tuned. And when you know how to play it you could play tunes quite melodically.  The sounds this musical instrument makes are melodic not shrill and ear piercing. This harmonica suitable either for a child or for an adult to play with Christmas carols would sound good if tune played successfully on this harmonica. One of the reasons I bought this harmonica for my grandson aged 5 is because he has a very slight speech problem. We use harmonicas and other blowing tools at work with our special needs children who have speech problems. A harmonica is good for strengthening the lips, lip pursing. Also will help those with poor breath control. Blowing the Harmonica will provide a good work out for the lips and mouth muscles strengthening them making it easier to say sounds. Also a harmonica is fun to use. Children love to make noises and this harmonica is perfect as I said it is a pleasant sound not screeching or ear piercing.  This harmonica seems sturdy and I think will last a long time. Making music with a harmonica is fun for both children and adults.I dare you to have a harmonica around and not to blow it they are so tempting. Trouble is this is a great way to pass on germs it s a bit like snogging the previous player and catching their germs. For some tips for how to play a harmonica go to. http://harmonica.com/ or http://www.harmonicalessons.com/ I think a harmonica would make super stocking filler.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5646482:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6239059:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6288851:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6450234:4:::5499641:4:::5620008:4:::6238803:4:::5348537:4:::5348537:4:::5020702:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::5244087:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5584168:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5921889:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6447607:4:::6256267:4:::6256267:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::6459776:4:::6459776:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6545126:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6316362:4:::6316362:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The train is a sleek looking blue vehicle designed for speed, the carriages are both email blue too they are simple with a slot along the centre top in this slot your child can slot the email messages that are to be delivered.  With the train you also get a net worker figure and 2 emails which the net worker figure can hold in his /her hand when delivering them. This train will add a little extra to the Classic set adding more play opportunities. The net worker figure can ride the train and send the messages.Your child does not need a computer to play with this train as it runs on a classic old fashioned brio system. But if your child wishes to hear the messages he/she will need a mail reader, this is a block to with a place to slot the email message in and a place for the net worker figure to stand the email messages can be heard using the rail hub that is available. This set does not come with a mail reader, or hub. You do not need the extra sets  with this train but I think some of them they are good if  your child is to get full value. For full details of Brio networker EMO sets go to http://brio.knex.com/customer/home.php?cat=379 cp=1 startnum=0. There areThere are  packs of email message ,A mail reader , A mail hub, , funky modern looking net workers to go with this set . Some of these figures are the baddies the viruses. Brio trains are well made, and classic toys that will last a generation or two they last well are durable... My grandson has many brio trains and has spent hours playing with them. This train is suitable for a child aged 3 and over although a slightly younger child may play with it too. My grandson aged 5 still plays with his wooden brio trains but not as much as he used to. Brio trains are compatible with the Tesco range of brio trains and tracks, also with the Hero sets and the ELC train sets  The basic emo transporter set that I described  is available at many places It s a    11.97 from http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brio-33286000-BRIO-33286- Transporter/dp/B000EGFSVQ/ref=pd_bxgy_k_h_b_cs_text_b/202-5450309-3744640 http://www.amazon.com/Brio-33286000-Network-EMO 2527s-  Transporter/dp/B000EGFSVQ has it reduced from the RRP of 24  to 12     8.49 from http://www.littlenuttreetoys.co.uk /buy-toys.php? item=411. To be honest I prefer the classic old fashioned Brio wooden train sets but maybe that s because I am not completely switched on to the computer age.     ::::5522492:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6243934:3:::6243934:3:::6302297:3:::6302297:3:::5646482:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::6556647:3:::5287742:3:::5287742:3:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5719918:4:::5633146:4:::6239059:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5407970:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6238803:4:::5335750:4:::5350681:4:::5350681:4:::5921889:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6450234:4:::6452385:4:::5620008:4:::6413554:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::6458213:4:::6458213:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6542585:4:::6542585:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5687589:4:::5687589:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5584168:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5055846:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5244087:4:::6288851:4:::6447607:4:::5591704:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5684916:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6483659:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6408658:4:::6439681:4:::6439681:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hotpoint RLAV 21::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::17.11.2007::::    I will now tell you about the fridge my students keep their paced lunches in at my school. .  This fridge is the Hotpoint RLAV 21, a Hotpoint Iced Diamond fridge in Polar White This is a   white freestanding fridge with no freezer compartment. .This freezer stands83.6cm tall it is 54.6cm wide has a depth of 60 cm. the net capacity is 127 litres.  Open the door it opens on the right, I do not think this can be changed to open the other way.  Inside there are 2 glass shelves and a basket for fruit /veg at the bottom it is possible to stand something on the glass top of this basket below the two shelves effectively giving 3 shelves. The door is moulded to have 3 thin shelves the bottom one for milk and other bottles, this has a small front partition to it .to keep the bottles from falling over I guess. The next 2 shelves are suitable for butter, eggs, Marge etc... This fridge has an energy rating A.  Using on average annual energy consumption 150kw per hour. I have needed to clean outside and inside of this fridge a little its easy to wipe over with a cloth. I checked the price of the Hotpoint PLAV 21 its    169.99pfrom the electric shop    132 from 247 electrical,    128 at http://www.sainsburyskitchenappliances.co.uk/Product_Information.aspx?Produ ctID=1934 So far this fridge seems adequate for our needs storing little Johnnie s packed lunch to keep it cool.  . I work in a special needs school so perhaps we are more cautious about keeping children s food cooled than a normal school where I doubt that a fridge would be provided for students use, we also keep our class  food tech items in here . l     ::::6897067:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5522492:3:::5633146:3:::5719918:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6238803:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5407970:3:::5510910:3:::5646482:3:::6572749:3:::6354829:3:::6354829:3:::6477149:3:::6477149:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5244087:3:::5584168:3:::5708728:3:::5708728:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::6436028:3:::6205746:3:::5805660:3:::6439184:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5623801:4:::5623801:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6458213:4:::6458213:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6576470:4:::6576470:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6450234:4:::6288816:4:::6288816:4:::6483659:4:::5620008:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6242691:4:::6452385:4:::6571765:4:::6571765:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5591704:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5921889:4:::5816422:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6378505:4:::6551921:4:::5350681:4:::5350681:4:::6585647:4:::5347743:4:::6576767:4:::6576767:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6239059:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Dalberg Daisy::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::13.11.2007::::    Although this daisy is native to Dahlberg daisy is native to south central Texas and northern Mexico. It grows well in my garden.I have about 3 Dahlberg daisies in my pot next to the front door. They are a lovely mound of bright yellow flowers.I bought mine as plants from the garden centre. But you can easily grow them from seed (so info on them says) I shall try that next year. My Dahlberg daisies have given me a stunning show of bright yellow flowers since July. I expect the frosts will get them soon; they will only survive outside in a frost free area. This plant is an annual but it self sets seeds on the garden and if you are sheltered from frost it might survive another year.UPDATE~~~~~~~~ my plant in pot sheltered one dide by fence open allother sides to air has survived 2 frosts well.This plant is low growing 6-12 in /15.2-30.5 cm and will spread 18 inches. Mine have covered the pot and trails down the side.This plant has formed a spreading bush. The stems have many branches with leaves that are feathery and a lovely green. The yellow daisy like flowers are numerous, the flowers are     inch 1.3 cm in diameter. When the leaves are crushed and bruised they smell lemony. My daisies are in full sun they seem to love it, I also have a chalky soil and they seem to love that too. Apparently these flowers grow well in a rockery. They really are a great ground cover plant. So ideal for a poor stony soil. This plant needs a little watering but will tolerate dryish soil for a while. I had to move some because of overcrowding in my pot and planted them in the front border they are forming a super cover of green fern leaves and bright flowers.When I get some seeds next year I shall plant in doors sometime between Feb and March. And transplant outside when frosts are over. These daisies will flower from June and mine are still flowering now. I looked on line to see where I could buy seeds and I found the following websites.http://www.2bseeds.com/dahlbergdaisyindex.shtmlhttp://www. packetseeds.com/acatalog/Dahlberg_Daisy___Thymophylla_tenuiloba_.htmlhttp ://www.eseeds.com/c-4963-baskets-and-planters-designer-collection-01.aspx prices about a pound a packet.

       " '5247778::::Radox Showerfresh Refresh Hair & Body Gel::::Beauty::::40::::very helpful::::15.11.2007::::    After a hectic day at work, with demanding children round my feet, I often feel the need to get home and refresh myself. I sometimes get home have that cup of tea and then take all my clothes off and shower. I use a variety of shower creams one I have used is Radox refresh.Price and availability~~~~~~~~~~~~ Radox refresh shower and hair gel is available from Tescos for    1.00. This is for a 250ml bottle this is cheaper than some other shower gels such as imperial leather or Palmolive. Radox refresh may also be bought at other supermarkets and chemists too.I note on eBay this shower gel is also available in a 500 ml bottlePackaging.~~~~~~~~~ This is a newer packaging to the bottle displayed in the picture. This gel is contained in a clear plastic bottle that has a green base with a hole that the liquid can be squeezed out of. It has a sloping top that has a green plastic lift up hook. So this is ideal to hang up in the shower. There is the word radox and refresh on the bottle and a label listing ingredients.Product ~~~~~~Yes this is a light green coloured liquid it squeezes easily out of the bottle not too runny. This gel is not just suitable for my body but for hair too. I always start by washing my long locks I do not need a great deal of this liquid to make lather. I do use a conditioner after using Radox refresh shower and hair gel though as my long hair can get tangled. Ok so I rinse it out of my hair and put conditioner on .then I wash my body. As I said there is quite a good lather produced so I do not need lashings of gel. I rinse of the soap from my body and wrap myself in a warm towel and then put some clothes on. I feel clean and refreshed its amazing the effects a shower can have. My skin is not sensitive but unless you have very sensitive skin this product should be ok.Perfume. This gel does have a perfume it s a slightly herby smell there s a hint of mint and other green smells. It is a unisex smell, not flowery not spicy. After the shower these is a slight fresh clean aroma left on my skin. This gel like most other soaps will sting if you get it into eyes, so be careful~~~~~~ I find the radox hair and body gel range excellent for holidays especially camping holidays as I only need the one bottle. Between hubby and myself .I can just get away with out conditioner if necessary.  Several other perfumes and types are available in this range of Radox hair and body gel. You can have a  relax  ing shower, replenish, recharge or invigorate with other Radox shower gels.About Radox ~~~~~~~~~ Radox should know what they are doing making soap/shower products as they are a firm who have been making   products for bathing for over 100 years they started in 1807 making some foot salts. The radox show gels were introduced in the 70 s Radox is now owned by the Sarah Lee Company     ::::5719918:4:::6288851:4:::5663139:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6483659:4:::5608754:4:::5608754:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6571765:4:::6571765:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5244087:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5921889:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5584168:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6569579:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5620008:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6442533:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5490500:4:::5490500:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Frabar Skittle Set::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::08.11.2007::::    Skittles~~~~~~I sometimes play skittles at work, and thought they would probably make a Christmas present for present for a child. One of the skittle sets we have is the Fraber skittle set. I notice kiddiecare  http://www.kiddicare.com are selling them for    2.99. What Farber skittles are made of and how they look~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A set of these skittles contains 6 skittles. A black plastic ball comes with the set.The skittles are made of a bright plastic 2 red 2 blue and 2 yellow. These skittles have a long curvy cylinder type of body with a couple or ridges around the circumference.  The middle of the cylinder slightly fatter than the base and top .There is a rounded ball type top. The plastic is fairly soft it is possible to squeeze it when you pick the skittles up. These skittles are suitable for playing inside the house or outside they are fairly light and do not tale a lot to knock over. Because they are a light plastic they should not damage furniture or chip paint of the wall.How to play skittles~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Stand the skittles up on a flat floor surface 3 at the back then two in front of them between the spaces then one skittle centre front. This is a turn taking game and you decide how far back you or the children stand to be fair everyone rolls /throws the ball from the same distance, bit you may decide to  let the youngest or least able stand closer to the skittles. Each player has a turn rolling /throwing the ball at the skittles and count how many they knock over. You may decide to let each player have 1, 2, or 3 turns before counting the fallen skittles. After each turn the skittles are picked up and repositioned for the next player.The winner is the person who knocks down the most skittles. An alternative way to play~~~~~~~ If you could stand the skittles on a table and roll the ball along the table to knock them down. I have used a chute like guttering to enable some fairly immobile students with little strength inn their arms to play  Place the chute on the student s knee while they are sitting in wheelchair or on a standard chair.  Let them point and position the chute towards the skittles. Give the student a ball and let them roll the ball down the chute. This way you can give the student as much or little help as they need. This will give a disabled person the opportunity to join in with others and gat pleasure from playing a game.Skills learnt from playing skittles ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Basic maths counting. Eye hand co-ordination is practiced, gross motor skills are practiced, and Turn taking and sharing is an important lesson learnt playing this game. If you are using the Farber skittles colour recognition can be learnt.  Skittles can be a fun game.  For all the family might be better than watching the TV all Christmas day. Playing this game of skittles is good practice for 10 pin bowling. Or lawn bowls.  I am going bowling as part of my schools staff Christmas Get together I think I need to practice my hand eye coordination with the schools set of these before I go. Would I recommend these farber skittles       ? Well yes they fit the requirements for a game of skittles.  They may not be the best or the most exciting or nice looking set of skittles. There are many other skittle sets available, more adult wooden ones and soft fabric ones for young children.  These Farber skittles should last a fairly long time unless you really squash them completely out of shape. Easy to clean and store. If you really want a cheap set of skittles and you drink squash or pop out of plastic bottles you could save the bottles and use these as skittles. Weight the bottles slightly by putting a little sand, pasta or rice in them and knock them over with a ball.     ::::6572749:3:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5663139:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6140875:4:::6140875:4:::5244087:4:::6239669:4:::6540512:4:::5700904:4:::6582683:4:::5837391:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5510910:4:::6450234:4:::6578529:4:::6578529:4:::5921889:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5279678:4:::6288851:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5584168:4:::6325121:4:::5793515:4:::5843359:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6452385:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5255134:4:::5646482:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5657574:4:::5657574:4:::5416378:4:::5816422:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6467283:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6417425:4:::6417425:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bosch WAE28363GB::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::05.11.2007::::    I have used the  Bosch WAE28363GB washing machine at work to wash our pupils swimming wear, towels and sometimes their clothes if they have an  accident . I work in a special needs school and do have some soft fabrics in the classroom that I sometime wash too. We have only had this washing machine this term; I have used it a few times. Bosch isr reputedly a good make, I think this is one of the reasons why we got it as we need products that do not break, that will last a long time. I have found this macine easy to use .The Bosch WAE28363GB machine is a white colour. It has a spin speed of 1400rpm. This washing machine is a cold fill machine.This machine is freestanding although you could put it under a shelf and between other kitchen appliances. The height is a standard 84.7cm; width 60cm, the depth including the distance the machine needs to stand away from the wall is 59cm.The door hinges on the left side and opens wide so I can bundle the towels inThe energy used is1.02kwh on 60c cotton wash it uses 45 litres of water on the same wash. The wash on this 60c cotton wash lasts 135 minutes.The wash load capacity is 6kg. There are 15 clothes wash options; I have only used a few. They range from a heavy soil to a freshen up with options for wool or delicates washing. There is a reduced ironing option and an aqua plus option for rinsing this will remove more detergent residue than the standard rinse. This is a fairly quiet machine that you can delay the washing time by 24 hours. The washing is an A classification, the drying spin efficiency B Max spin speed: 1400 rpm . It seems to wash well as far as I can tell. We nearly always use the tumble drier that stands by its side at work as there are no facilities for outside /air drying. This machine is washers only no tumble facility. If you have room I think the separate options better than a washer dryer.Price and availability.  I can find information that this machine costs between     319 (Biasco) and    369   comet most stores offer free delivery.

       " \"5247778::::Woolgar's Farm Peg Tray Puzzle::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::04.11.2007::::    I am going to describe a farm tray peg puzzle that I have played with. There are many children s puzzles featuring farm animals.I am not sure of the manufacturer of this toy but this puzzle is available at for    5.99P at http://www.woodentoysonline.co.uk/acatalog/Peg_Puzzles.htmlI   This wooden puzzle has 9 pieces. It is a strong wood and will not get bent or damaged easily. This is an inset puzzle each puzzle piece is a complete animal which your child has to find the correct shaped hole/space for. Each piece has a small peg on it to make it easy for your child to pick the puzzle piece up and insert it into the correct space.  The Animals on this farm jigsaw are a sheep, chicken, a duck, a dog, a cat, a cow, a horse of course. There is also a tree and a farmer s wife. These pieces need only a little jiggling to get then into the correct position if your child finds the right shaped hole. Although this jigsaw puzzle is ok I think there are better animal puzzles on the market, ones where there is a picture of the animal in the hole, ones with better animal pictures on the puzzle pieces. However the pictures are not especially babyish making it more age appropriate for slightly older pupils whose skills are limited This puzzle is suitable for a child aged about 2 -5 years old dependant on their development of course. Insert puzzles are good for helping a child develop their concentration and their fine motor skills. Peg puzzles are good as they seem to be easier to position for most children encouraging them to use a pincer grip. Some of my pupils do find that pincer grip difficult though and need assistance, Thanks for reading   if you are stuck for an idea for a Christmas present for a young child. I would recommend a puzzle like this.   juio     ::::5522492:3:::6540512:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5351312:3:::5351312:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5584168:3:::6243934:3:::6243934:3:::5793515:3:::6238803:3:::5646482:3:::6325121:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5633146:4:::6542585:4:::6542585:4:::5719918:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5416378:4:::6323918:4:::6323918:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5255134:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6442533:4:::5510910:4:::6242691:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5921889:4:::6452385:4:::5567856:4:::5567856:4:::6378505:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6457223:4:::6457223:4:::6288851:4:::6185895:4:::6185895:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6447607:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5256544:4:::5256544:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5843359:4:::5805660:4:::5542565:4:::6239059:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6413554:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",

I have seen and played with this blossom farm chime ball from the early learning centre. The early learning centre has had this ball for sale for a few years now. This chime ball costs    5. It is available on line ( http://www.elc.co.uk/toy-41047? category_id=864 parent_category_id=531 pare nt_category_id=531 ) and ion high street shops.The blossom farm chime ball is made from fabric so it s soft. This ball is made with 6 different coloured pieces of fabric which are sewn so in segments so that the ball looks like a colourful orange. One piece is spotty. The fabric is a type of jersey towelling  Come and play with baby and this ball with me.Can you see the ball baby yes its up here, listen I will shake the ball has a chime in it. Ohh did you see babies eyes look at the ball and baby smiled lets shake the ball again. Baby is trying to reach for the ball how sweet. There, there baby the ball is for you, you can hold it. Look baby is holding the ball tight in her/his grip the ball is going straight into baby s mouth. Ahhh babies always put things in their mouths. This ball is quite soft and safe. Come on baby give me back the ball, go on give it to me, baby is holding onto the ball tight.  Come on baby I want that ball, that s right good girl boy. Watch the ball as I roll it along your highchair tray that s right there it s rolling back again, can you hear its making a ringing chiming noise as it rolls along. Ooooppps it s fallen on the floor. There now I have picked it up you can play with this ball. Oh look baby has picked the ball up again she /he has thrown it on the floor it made a noise when it fell on the floor didn t it baby did you hear it ring.

       " \"5247778::::Member Advice on Toys and your Child's Development::::Ciao Caf�::::50::::very helpful::::20.02.2005::::    A toy, the dictionary definition of toy is an artefact designed to be played with. Play is the means by which children discover and understand the world in which they live a practice for life. Toys are the tools that are used to do this.I am a qualified nursery nurse, have taken courses in play therapy and have worked with children about 30 years I think that play is the most important activity for a developing child. Play is good for Adults too. Play does not need toys but they are a useful aid to play. There are so many toys available many more than when I was a child.  There are Toys suitable for all ages. Does that Adult get more pleasure when he is driving his sports car than the child with his shiny red pedal car?I think play is so important that I am glad of this opportunity to write about it. I have written mostly about play and toys up to seven yrs. The first years of life and play is so important for physical , emotional developmentand.Give your child different opportunities and experiences, you do not have to pay a fortune on the latest toy. Computer and computer games have become popular but spend some time away from the computer and TV playing more traditional games. Types of play  Well to begin with a child will play on their own solitary not relating or playing with others. He will then play happily alongside another child, (parallel play) not joining in with but happy to be beside someone else. Then at around the age of three he will join in with others playing co-operatively with other children. There are different types of play:EXPLORATORY PLAY Exploring the world. By taste, touch seeing and hearing.CONSTRUCTIVE PLAY Discovering how things work, how they are made and what properties they have.SKILFULL PLAYMaking those models out of Lego. Making jigsaw puzzles,PRETEND PLAY I like to call this practice for life. Acting out real life situations in a safe play environment MODELLING PLAYImitating their observations of others. Copying mum or dad bathing the baby or cooking the meal mending the car, reading the paper.

There will be crazes for toys, toys you buy that seem great but do not get played with. Toys that become favourites and get played with endlessly.I f a toy does not get played with put it away bring it out again when child is ready for it  Remember to look for the safety mark when you are buying a toy.  Spend on a good toy so it will be durable but also there are many cheap pocket money toys that will not last long these equally have their place. I know that I have not covered everything in this review.not enough room  I really need to write a book / Children do develop at different rates the ages I have used are very approximate. Working with special needs children I know how valuable it is to give children the tools and opportunities for play.  No need to spend a fortune on toys it does not make you a better parent.  This month I shall be mostly writing about toys and I thought a general review about play and toys would be my introduction. Hope you do not get too fed up with my toy opps.

       " '5247778::::Argos Solid Pine 2x2 Multi Toy Unit on Wheels::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::29.10.2007::::    I recently bought a 2x2 pine multi toy unit from Argos. I needed/wanted to have a storage unit to store all the grand children s toys in as I was getting fed up with clutter all around after they had gone home. This 2x2 unit costs    44.99p available in Argos stores or on line at http://www.argos.co.uk. This toy store unit is also available in larger sizes. 3x3 or 2x3 or an L shaped unit with 6 spaces.I also purchased some blue and red plastic boxes to fit into the unit as these do not come with it. Ok so I walked/ struggled a bit (could really have done with hubbies help a bit) out of our local Argos with this unit it comes flat packed. Getting the unit home I was eager to erect it. I undid the card box found the instructions and read those first. I then took out all of the pieces from the box and checked they were all there. Now began nearly an hour of fitting it together. I fitted the screws through the correct holes that were drilled ready turned the screws with the Alan key that was provided, I also needed a scew driver. The first pieces were fairly easy to fit but as I progressed it was a little more difficult as you had to move .walk around the unit to fit the screws I really did this in too small a space top of the stairs. Well I did complete this task successfully and without too much difficulty. I checked it for rigidity and the unit shelves were firm.  Some wheels came with this pack they can be fitted to the base of the unit, but I felt that I did not want the grandchildren moving the unit around so have kept the wheels safe in case I decide to add them another time.  Then I moved the unit into the little bedroom and admired my work. Not too bad I thought. I inserted the plastic boxes and I thought its ok. Would look better with rush or grass or cane boxes but for the use its going to get will be ok. I could leave it with no boxes and use as a display / book shelf. The size of the boxes to fit this unit is (H) 24.2, (W) 38, (D) 47cm. There is plenty of space around these boxes when they are fitted into the unit.. The pine wood is solid, looks like a lot of the wood in these cheap pine furniture ok but not brilliant. The pine is not treated so you can stain paint or varnish the surface. I left ours natural it suits the rest of the house. These units would look alright in a bedroom a hall or could be used in the garage. The size of the 2x2 that I have is Size (H) 64.4, (W) 85.2, (D) 48.5cm. Over all yes I would recommend these pine units they are fairly cheap reasonably easy to put together, maybe not the best bit of furniture but ok for the purpose. I have seen these or similar in schools for storing toys.     ::::6540512:3:::5410178:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5522492:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6452385:4:::5633146:4:::6239669:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6526351:4:::6230899:4:::6230899:4:::5719918:4:::6468264:4:::5510910:4:::5793515:4:::6238803:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6471685:4:::6471685:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5620008:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5646482:4:::5921889:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6288851:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::5843359:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5584168:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5020702:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6569579:4:::6166273:4:::6166273:4:::6439681:4:::6439681:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6566254:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5565496:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6566660:4:::6566660:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5699215:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::6242691:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6378505:4:::21963:4:::6535533:4:::6535533:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Pack of 6, 32 Litre Storage Boxes::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::27.10.2007::::    I have been trying to organise the small bedroom that the grandchildren use at my house. I bought a pine multi unit system from Argos, I needed to buy some storage boxes to put their toys and clutter in that would slide into this unit. Now I did not really want plastic boxes    .. But they were the most practical. I bought a pack of 6 Pack of 6, 32 Litre Stack  n  Nest Boxes. This pack costs    7.99 that s a fair price for 6 boxes to store the grand children s toys in.  These boxes are made out of plastic 3 red and 3 blue boxes in the set, that s good Adrian has the red ones Cassie the blue. Now I did not really want plastic boxes    .. . I would have liked grass cane or rush. The plastic ones are more practical cheaper than cane grass or rush. I think that plastic is better for storing children s toys. There are no rough edges. They are easy to clean and will take a bit more rough treatment than rush. Plastic should last a longer time than the rush or sea grass boxes. The size of each of these multi purpose boxes is (H) 24.2, (W) 34, (D) 47cm. quite a few toys will fit into a box so that when the grandchildren go home my floor is clear of children s. These boxers look quite neat, bright colors, not as terrible as I thought. These boxes are not too large to lift and carry, I am often taking them downstairs full of the children s toys then upstairs again. These boxes will either stack on top or nest inside each other. The plastic lip at the of the boxes is shaped so that if you put the boxes on top one way they will nest into each other , turn one around they will stack .  This is ideal. These boxes are open topped they not have lids but for my purpose lids are unnecessary. You can use these plastic storage boxes for many things. Ideal for storing tools and clutter in the garage. Or they would be fine in a bedroom for storing student s books, or even shoes and clothing. If you are just starting a home /flat these would be fine cheap and cheerful. Yes if you needed some cheap, cheerful plastic boxes without lids these would be fine I am happy with mine, when the g rand children grow up I may get some rush boxes for my unit and use these for storage in the garage     ::::5522492:3:::5687298:3:::5687298:3:::5238639:3:::5238639:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6596613:4:::6596613:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5719918:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::6239669:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6242691:4:::6166860:4:::6166860:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5793515:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5843359:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6540512:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5620008:4:::5289781:4:::5289781:4:::5921889:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5646482:4:::5365662:4:::5365662:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::21963:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6212982:4:::6559918:4:::5624457:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5584168:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Lego Fire, Police & Vehicles: Police Boat::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::21.10.2007::::    * Duplo lego bricks.* I am too old top have played with Lego duplo as a child  , but because I have worked with children for 35 years now  I have played with these bricks so often.  Duplo bricks are really good for children helping their creativity and fine motor control. Duplo bricks are ideal for a child aged between 2 and 5; older children will use Duplo alongside standard Lego as they will fit.  Lego bricks were developed in the 1950 s, The first Duplo lego bricks were made in 1969.Duplo Lego wears well, it is suitable for both  nursery or home situations at home it will last a generation or two of children. My grandson plays with his mothers old Duplo nearly 30 years old. Its good to buy second hand can be easily cleaned and disinfected and should have suffered no breakages occasionally a little chipping but very rarely. Lego is a safe toy for a small child no rough edges big enough not to be swallowed.*Recently I have seen the Duplo police boat*. This toy is will be ideal for a 3 or 4 year olds.  . This box of bricks includes 2 boats, 1 blue and white police boat, one yellow boat, 2 figures. There is a red plastic suitcase brick in this set for the robbers to steal away. There are a few other standard Duplo bricks with the set too they make an island and a yellow light brick for the top of a tower of bricks to make a lighthouse. The police boat has a blue cabin with windows which your child and you can fit onto the studs on the base of the boat. There is brick which is blue and grey to resemble the police light this can be fitted on top of the boat cabin. There is a lower section on the boat for the police duploman to stand while driving the boat. There are studs over most of the boat so your child can use his/her imagination and add other Lego bricks or people.The other boat is a yellow boat not as grand as the police boat,   but the  naughty  Duplo people could use this to get away with the jewels. Or maybe the Duplo police can help rescue Duplo people who are having trouble with this boat, the play scenarios are as endless as your Childs imagination. The yellow boat also has many studs on it to fix other Duplo bricks onto.These Lego boats will float on water, so you could use it in a water tray; there are many play opportunities with this set. I think this is a good addition to a Duplo Lego set. *Availability and price* From the lego store  http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=4861 this toy costs    19.95pI saw this Lego police boat set in JLEWIS S today in Watford so I am sure you will be able to find it in high street shops that sell lego/duplo toys.Yes I would recommend this toy as a Christmas present for a child aged between 2 and 6 dependent on their maturity.     ::::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::5719918:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5620008:4:::6166860:4:::6166860:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6452385:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::6569579:4:::6413554:4:::5649437:4:::5649437:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::5779979:4:::5779979:4:::5793515:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::6535491:4:::6185895:4:::6185895:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5480196:4:::5480196:4:::5843359:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5244087:4:::5646482:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6540512:4:::6572749:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6323918:4:::6323918:4:::6325121:4:::6288851:4:::5584168:4:::6468264:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5921889:4:::6535533:4:::6535533:4:::6239669:4:::6461332:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5816422:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6239059:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6242691:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

After driving to the alps and camping in the French Alps for a few nights we drove into Italy and camped at a campsite in Sarre which is in the  Val de aosta Sarre is about 35 k from the French Italian border at only a couple of miles from Aosta itself.. The camp site is situated by the N26 which is the road that goes along the valley to Aosta there is a new payage road that goes from  France into Italy past  Aosta and beyond  do not take this or you will whiz straight past. This campsite was in a good position for us it was easy to access either back into France or forward into Italy near the lovely town of Aosta . Also only a short journey up and over the pass into Switzerland. It was at the bottom of the valley so we could explore the side valleys Climb Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn.  If you are a skier there are plenty of opportunities easy to get to from this site (if you go at the right time of year) .Turn into the campsite and you will see some parking on the left for if you return late at night as they close the gates at I think 11 o clock it might have been 10.30 though .In front of you top the right is the small reception office. Ok so we booked in for a few nights cost is:- 3 euros for a car, 3.10 euros for our 2 man tent a bigger tent cost slightly more 5 euros per adult its 3.70 euros per child but we did not have one with us one, if we had wanted electric it was 2.50 euros to be plugged in. So 16.10 euros for hubby and me to stay a night. That s about ten pounds per night. This site had room for caravans to park, I think there might have been a few that were there all the time.  There were grassy areas to park put your tent up on. The site had a few trees which made it pleasant, not quite as nice as the French site but ok. I am not sure how many places for camping there was but this site is not very big it s 7500 sq metres and has a few different bays for camping screened by hedges and a few trees for shade. The camping spaces were a reasonable size. The site was fairly quiet apart from the family with a squawking infant; they only stayed a couple of daysThe River Dora Baltea ran along by the bottom of the campsite. The motorway along the other side of this river. I did wonder if this would make camping very noisy, but it did not as the sound of the traffic was constant in the background and disguised by the river sounds. We had what we though a good position for our tent it was by the perimeter fence by the river. We turned our tent so we opened to look at  the river ,the mountains and valley not the rest of the camp site. We had a tremendous view to see when we ate our evening meal that I cooked on the camping gas Facilities~~~~~ The facilities for washing and showering were fine a row of individual shower which needed a 50c coin. Doesn t worry the camp site office have plenty of change. The time that 50c lasted was enough to quickly shower   There was a separate ladies and gents toilet and washing area which seemed adequate for the number of people on site. There was warm water to wash with. These areas were kept fairly clean, I saw a cleaner daily. Dish washing. ~~~~~~~~~There were several large sinks in an area designated for washing up they all had cold taps but there was a hot tap you could fill your bowl from and carry to your basin area. Plenty of space. Clothes washing /drying There were sinks for washing your clothes by hand free warm water, and also a coin operated washing machine. There did not seem to be a tumble drier though.These facilities were adequateChildren s games ~~~~~~~~~There was a small playground for children, table tennis/ping pong and basket ball nets. Food and drink ~~~~~~~ There is a supermarket along the road to Aosta 10 minutes walk away. There is also a small shop in the village.  There are a couple of bars within walking distance. I know there are two restaurants one very near 2 minutes just the other side of the road and one 10 minutes walk towards Aosta. So you can get all your necessaries without going far. This campsite is kept clean and tidy, the hosts welcoming and helpful. I think it was in an ideal position for us to explore this part of the Aosta valley.  With both easy walks and more demanding walks and activities available. The nearby Town of Aosta a delight to explore.  Sadly we could not get  enjoy our holiday more as my husband was quite ill for several days but We want to go back to this area again one day and would be happy to camp at this campsite again website address below if you fancy a look.http://www.campingmontebianco.it/eng/benvenuti.asp..     ::::5522492:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6496624:4:::6496624:4:::6521661:4:::5207685:4:::5207685:4:::6230899:4:::6230899:4:::5633146:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6413554:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5805660:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6540512:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::6239669:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6242691:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5646482:4:::5921889:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6468819:4:::6468819:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5719918:4:::5843359:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6288851:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6197992:4:::6197992:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5624457:4:::5590172:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5335750:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5244087:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::6468264:4:::5584168:4:::5347743:4:::6256267:4:::6256267:4:::5816422:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5410178:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::6569579:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::5368530:4:::5368530:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bears in the Night - Jan Berenstain, Stan Berenstain::::Books::::50::::very helpful::::15.10.2007::::    Bears in the night  This is the first  quot;ghost quot; story my daughter ever heard. Sally my daughter was born in 1978 this book was published in 1971, I had read it before to children at work.This book is suitable for children from a very young age it is a Beginner s book, edited by Dr Seuss published by Random house. Are you sitting comfortably then I will begin to tell you about the story.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  There are 7 bears  quot;In bed quot; The word  quot;WHOOOOO quot; is coming through the window the bears in their pyjamas get  quot;out of bed quot; and go  quot;To the window quot;. The bears climb  quot;out the window quot; and  quot;down the tree quot;.  The bears go   quot;over the wall  quot;,       quot;under the bridge quot;  quot;around the lake   quot;between the rocks quot;  quot;through the woods quot; Then  quot;up spook hill quot;   quot;Whooo quot;. The bears  are spooked , they hastily retreat  We see  an owl sitting in a tree going Whooo I do not think the bears have seen the owl,   quot;down spook hill   quot;  they return the same way they got up spook hill finally climbing quot; up the tree  quot;  quot;In the window quot; until finally they are  quot;back in bed quot;.Words~~~ The words are great they are repeated often.  Children love the repetitiveness and I have known young children who can not read  quot;reading this book quot; as they are so enthralled with the book and the words they have memorised the words. The words I put in speech marks are in fact the only words of the book. The words are simple, words an early reader will learn quickly.  This is a good book for learning those words for positioning in, under, on, up down.  Only a few words on each page more as the story progresses. This book is only 32 pages longIllustrations~~~~~The pictures are done in hues of blue gives that night time feel to the pages. The lantern that they carry gives of a yellow light and illuminates the way up spooky hill. The illustrations are great the pages are not fussy the pictures simple.  The way the bears bodies are position gives you the feeling that they are sneaking out creeping up spook hill. The bears have super wide eyed expressions on their faces. Babies relate and recognise the face form eyes nose mouth. While reading this story I make sure the children all can see the pictures. This is an easy book for me to do that with as I know the words of by heart Stan and Jan Bernstein are the authors and illustrators of this book. I really love this book. Whenever I read it. The  of children are   transfixed by the story. I read the beginning of the book slowly lingering on the words  quot;up spook hill quot; then I turn the page and say a scary Whooooooooooooo, hopefully making my children jump. Then the   words that repeat the journey down the hill I say quickly to give the children the impression that the bears are hurrying scared down the hill. Phew I exclaim wiping my brow and say the words on the last page  quot;back in bed quot;. I then turn the pages back to the picture of the owl and say I think it was the own saying whooooo scaring the bears. You weren t scared were you?                                           ~~~~Now a little about Stan and Jan Bernstein; Stan and Jan met at art school in Philadelphia and married when Stan came out of the army after the Second World War. They had been cartoon illustrators in magazines.   After the birth of their son they wrote and illustrated a baby book which was published. Jan and Stan have 2 sons. Mike the younger son is also a writer, illustrator of children s books.  In 1962 they began the series of books we know as the Bernstein bears edited by Dr Seuss and published by Random house. Sadly in 2005 at the age of 82 Stan Bernstein died.   Over 250 books with the characters the Bernstein bears have been published. For Christmas 2007 a Bernstein bear book trim the tree a lift the flap book is being published written and illustrated by Jan and her son Mike Bernstein. So there will be a new fun book for me to read and enjoy 30 + years after I read the first bear book.   If you wisg to hear /read the story go to http://edamonth.homestead.com/readBearsInTheNight1.html here you will hear someone reading the word and see them printed , to be honest I think I read the words better with more atmosphere than the guy  you will hear readingIf you wish to buy Bears in the night .

       " '5247778::::Lego Duplo Building Plates::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::12.10.2007::::    I play with Lego duplo building plates identical to this everyday; we have some at work, and guess what I have some at home for the grandchildren to build on.. Lego duplo is a really good construction toy and when your child is making a building base plates are good for added stability and a firm base to build on. Lego duplo is suitable for children aged 3 -5 years old, bit this really depends on their maturity, development and skills I have known under threes play happily with duplo and over 5 s play with it too. Duplo helps develop your childs gross and fine motor skills , these plates being different colours are attractive and can help colour recognition.These base plates come in a set of 3, a red one a blue one a green one. Each of these base plates are 6 studs by 9 studs 54 studs in total. These plates are big enough for placing duplo bricks on side by side building a boat maybe or making a tower, let your Childs imagination run riot. A word of warning you may not be able to recognise the identity of the finished construction. Ask your child about it rather than saying that are a lovely house when really in your Childs mind it may be a swimming pool There are larger Lego duplo base plates available too but these smaller ones are fine  especially for the younger age range.Lego duplo is a strong plastic well constructed it will last many many playhours  , if when your child grows out of it you keep it  your next generation will play with it . I kept duplo from 25 years ago and my grandchildren now play with it. Duplo base plates are easy to clean just wash them in warm water with a preferred detergent or disinfectant (babies love to mouth everything and pass on their germs) These base plates are not too expensive RRP    3.99. They are available at a lot of toy stores and on line. The Lego store http://shop.lego.com/Product/?p=2198 has them available. Amazon has a store selling them for    1.99p. You will have to pay    4 at http://www.toys-express.co.uk/acatalog/Bricks.html. These building plates would make a good addition to any child duplo toy collection. Have good play value and, long levity, if you see them cheap second hand they are likely to be in a good condition. Thanks for reading; off to work now to play with this toy, I love my work playing with toys all day     shame about the children being there too   61514;     ::::5522492:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6239669:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5633146:4:::5590172:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6242691:4:::6377619:4:::6377619:4:::5347743:4:::5238639:4:::5238639:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5335750:4:::5921889:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5646482:4:::6318572:4:::6318572:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5020702:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6484083:4:::6325121:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6378906:4:::6540512:4:::5584168:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5843359:4:::6413554:4:::5620008:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6526351:4:::5837391:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5352779:4:::5352779:4:::6468264:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6288851:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5719918:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6239059:4:::6559918:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::5803721:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Weetabix Oatiflakes with Raisin, Cranberry & Blackcurrant::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::11.10.2007::::    Weetabix oatiflakes fall from the box into my bowl some mornings at 7oclock. I do not shower mine with milk I am a bit strange I eat my  oatiflakes without milk most people in fact nearly everyone except for me will add milk to their cereal. From my box golden crispy brown textured flakes fall these are made of oats. A few plump juicy raisins fall into my bowl too. I see some round dried fruits they are a dark red colour I pop one into my mouth I can just discern a cranberry taste. There are a few darker round dried fruits that fall into my bowl amongst the oat flakes. The darker fruits are black currant. They do not have a strong flavour in fact they are small sop I imagine I will rarely bite into one and release the flavour. However I do not eat each of the ingredients seperatly I load my spoon with a mixture. This is a satisfying breakfast. I believe it is fairly healthy.There is 363 k cal per 100g.  A serving is about 40g so 145 kcal per serving. There is 4.2 g fat per 100g not too bad. There is a good range of vitamins and some iron in Oatiflakes. So lots of energy and fibre provided in this bowl of cereal. Weetabix says it should keep you going to lunch time. Yes it does keep me going to lunch time , I am so busy  I do not have time to think about food for myself .I do not get a chance for a break till midday anyway , actually we do not get a midmorning break for coffee and a snack anyway.  Weetabix has been making breakfast cereal for many years and recently produced oatiflakes.  Oats are recognised as a healthy cereal. A good source of fibre which we are told can help reduce cholesterol. Oats have a low G I  so the sugar levels in our blood stream keep level.(sounds good no hyper kids first thing in the morning  and they car keep going longer before running out of energy)  . So oats are good for us. These cereals are great as they offer more choice to people with wheat allergies. Only draw back is the price. Like a lot of cereals I think they are expensive. I usually buy some own brand bran flakes to add a few to my bowl A   pack of weetabix Oatiflakes with Raisin, Cranberry   Blackcurrant usually retails at    2.50 for a475g box, but dash along to Sainsbury s and you will find the price reduced to    1.29p.     ::::6458724:3:::6458724:3:::5624457:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5522492:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::5244087:3:::6297090:3:::6297090:3:::5646482:3:::21963:3:::5951402:3:::6565934:3:::6565934:3:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::5633146:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5647046:4:::5647046:4:::5921889:4:::5620008:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6505713:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5843359:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5700904:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6169857:4:::5793515:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::6540512:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5608754:4:::5608754:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::6318281:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6171845:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5584168:4:::6468264:4:::5719918:4:::5540048:4:::5540048:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6288851:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::6378906:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5837391:4:::6559995:4:::6559995:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6378505:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::6497051:4:::6497051:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5699215:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::6242691:4:::5347743:4:::5020702:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::6239059:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Chelsea Bun::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::10.10.2007::::    Yes the Chelsea bun does originate from Chelsea although you can buy them nation wide  .It is thought that the Chelsea bun was first made in the Chelsea bun house on or near Grovesnor Row or Jew s Row. This bun shop was making Chelsea buns from the mid 17th early the shop closed in 1839 when it closed. This shop was visited by many including royalty, king Georges 11 and 111 on route to the nearby Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Availability Now I must admit to liking a Chelsea bun. I either buy mine from Tesco s or the local bakers and I have even made my own. Chelsea buns seem to be available at all bakers and supermarkets. The price for a pack of 4 Chelsea bun s at tesco is    1.09p  27 each  each at Sainsbury s     1.05p  for a 4 pack thats 26p each, from my local bakers it costs 75p  each there. The baker s bun is bigger fatter and a bit moister, fresher than the tesco packed buns but not sure if they are really 50p better?It is very possible that all of you know what a Chelsea bun is like, but to remind you I have written the following. Looks.~~~~ A Chelsea bun is a circular bun it is glazed with a honey glaze but rarely have sugar on top .This bun is  round made with a dough coiled into a spiral ,dried fruit can be seen peeping from the seams of the dough spiral. These buns are usually quite moist. Eating~~~~~ The way I and lots of other people like to eat these buns into slowly nibble  them and uncoiling the bun as I eat exposing the dried fruit on  the coils , be careful you do not lose the dried fruit sometimes it is not embedded /stuck on to the coils and falls onto your lap/ the floor.Taste.~~~~These taste great the bun is enriched bread dough a yeast bun. They are sweet and buttery with a hint of spice Making a Chelsea bun/recipe ~~~It is possible to make the dough in the bread maker then construct your bun, or make the dough using your hand; you get the satisfaction of kneading the dough this way.Recipe-------250g plain or strong white (bread flour)    teaspoon salt125ml milk1 sachet quick yeast40g margarine/butter100g dried fruit1tspoon mixed spice or cinnamon (I prefer cinnamon)25g brown sugarMethod Mix the flour and salt and rub in 15g of margarine/ butter. Add the yeast and warm milk to the flour mixture.Mix till its soft dough and knead the dough for a few minutes.Roll the dough out to nearly a square. Melt 25g of butter and then brush it over the surface of the dough.Sprinkle the dried fruit, sugar and spice evenly over the dough.Now roll up the dough like a Swiss roll and slice it into about 8 or 9 circles.Put these circles flat on a baking tray and leave to raise for a while buns should be about twice the size.Bake in over at 200C gas mark 6 for about 20 minutes. When baked you can sprinkle some sugar over the top, But I do not think this necessaryThere are many recipes for Chelsea buns on line, and in cookery books some slightly different to mine. Now I have written this I shall have to go and make some, Oh by the way in case you had not guessed these are very fattening   61514;     ::::6609678:4:::6230899:4:::6230899:4:::6545046:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5633146:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5335750:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5522492:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5805660:4:::5246905:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6239669:4:::5793515:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5646482:4:::21963:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6377619:4:::6377619:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5843359:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::6242691:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6540512:4:::5244087:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6461332:4:::5921889:4:::5700904:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::6559918:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5347743:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::6320122:4:::6320122:4:::6288851:4:::5584168:4:::6468264:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5929109:4:::5929109:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::6368847:4:::6368847:4:::5719918:4:::6497051:4:::6497051:4:::6538056:4:::5373984:4:::6496990:4:::6496990:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5764692:4:::5764692:4:::5714076:4:::5714076:4:::5415714:4:::6439681:4:::6439681:4:::5410178:4:::5803721:4:::6559995:4:::6559995:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6378505:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bluebell Creeper::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::08.10.2007::::    This bluebell creeper/Sollya heterophylla is an Australian native plant. It is able to survive our winters if kept in a warm sheltered position in the garden, but really more suited to growing in a greenhouse or conservatory.It is available at http://www.crocus.co.uk/plants/_/climbers/other-climbers /sollya-heterophylla/itemno.PL00006259/ price    8.95 for a 3 litre pot.This is as you can imagine from the name a creeper; it will climb and twine for about 6-12 foot 2-3 metres. You will need to tie the stems to support with raffia or twine.This is an evergreen creeper keeping green leaves all the year.In Australia this plant might be classed as a menace as Bluebell Creeper is an invasive  plant whose vines strangle indigenous plants. The flowers are as you might guess from the name blue and a bell shape.  Sometimes the flowers are white or a pinky blue. These blue bell flowers grow in a cluster. The bell of the flower is made up of 5 overlapping petals ; the petals are about 1 cm long. It is a very pretty dainty flower. The creeper flowers from June to September and then has blue berries. If you are growing this plant you need moderately fertile well drained soil. Although it needs regular watering do not over water .  I would not recomend growing this plant in England becauise it is non native ,Thanks for  reading  Mary     ::::6239669:3:::5522492:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::5633146:3:::21963:3:::6242691:3:::5276607:3:::5276607:3:::5805660:3:::5552490:3:::5552490:3:::5646482:3:::5374295:3:::5374295:3:::5530202:3:::5530202:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5365662:3:::5365662:3:::5793515:3:::5843359:3:::5584168:3:::2385:3:::2385:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6540512:3:::5351504:3:::5351504:3:::5020702:3:::6253630:3:::6253630:3:::6497002:3:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5719918:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6468264:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5620008:4:::6478325:4:::6288851:4:::5921889:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::6302297:4:::6302297:4:::5591704:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6378505:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5373984:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6202957:4:::6202957:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

The banner at the top of that page and every page on this site is a tartan with the words Scottish recipes and in smaller print just like granny made. There is the introductory paragraph and highlighted words to click on to visit the about Aberdeen website. Also a banner to click on to play a whack the haggis game.At the side of the introductory message are side bars a list of recipes for breakfast, starters main courses desserts and snacks. You can click on the tittles and up comes the recipes, yes quite a few traditional  Scottish recipes for things like rumbledethumps, (like bubble and squeak ) tablet, Cullen skink  (a fish soup)   The recipes are written with a Scottish flavour a few wee Scottish words like neeps , tatties , braw and a few others. These words are translated and explained immediately after you have read them  I have seen recipes for most of these in books on Scottish cookery so nothing really new but I think this site a useful resource, I may cook some Clapshot  (potatoes and swede)or maybe some stovies,  (sunday lunch leftovers)perhaps so skirlie. ((oatmeal and onion stuffing .)I believe this site is written or sponsored by the Aberdeen tourist board as there is a link to it saying  Our other site There are links to places of interest, places to stay, places to eat all in the Aberdeen area.

       " '5247778::::Giant Garden Connect Four::::Family::::40::::very helpful::::03.10.2007::::    In the 1920 s two brothers created a company selling textile remnants. They soon started making and selling pencil cases and things for schools. This company was Hasbro. Over the years Hasbro purchased various other toy companies. Working with children for many a year I have played with lots of Hasbro toys. I was in the playground at work this week and joined in a game of connect four on the giant garden edition of this game. A large garden connects four /four in the row is made by a couple of other manufactures but ours is the Hasbro one.Product description .~~~~~~~~The giant connect four is a giant edition of the smaller table top toy.  It is a large plastic toy. It is 1.1 metre tall. The main playing frame is a blue colour. This is slotted at the top so that you can post the discs in it. There are 7 rows of 6 round holes in the frame so that you can see the counters when they are in position. The bottom of this frame has a bar that can be released to let the discs fall through when you have completed the game. The playing blue frame is supported by two green struts these have feet on to balance and hold the game upright. The playing frame does not go right down to the floor it finishes just above it so that the discs can be removed from the base of the playing frame,At the side and bottom of each of the green struts is a little shelf this is to stack the playing discs on there is also the lever to pull to remove the base strip that keeps the playing disc from falling through the frame while the game is being played. (Pull these and the discs fall out of the bottom of the game)  There are 42 red or yellow discs/counters provided enough to fill all the spaces   there are equal amounts of red and yellow discs. This toy is a very sturdy toy made of a strong plastic.  You can leave it outside the entire year probably best if in a shed or garage during winter though.Price is~~~~~ RRP    136 at http://www.gardenoasis.co.uk/giant-connect-p-1112.html?osCsid=999dc5ace1376 8cf59824d21bc46c03b its    144.98p at http://www.mastersgames.com/cat/giant/giant-captains-mistress.htm its    123.32 ( 245). Suitable for:-~~~~ This toy is suitable for outside or inside games. For a school, a youth club, a pub or for a party maybe. If you are a really keen player then yes buy one for your home garden.How to play ~~~~~~~This game is easy it is a game for 2 players. Each player chooses which coloured disk/counter they are going to use. It is a turn taking game first one player drops their counter into a column the aim is to get four of your counters in a row vertically horizontally or diagonally. The winner is who gets four in a row first.  There is some skill and strategy in this game and some luck. I can not say it a game an intelligent adult, or child will play very often once they have mastered the skill. But it does have some play value.  Ours at school gets used mostly as a toy just simply to put the discs into. We have several children who will play for a long time just dropping the counters in and filling the spaces then releasing the counters on the floor. We have others who will make attempts to make patterns using the same coloured counters to make rows. Few of the pupils at my school use it as a game played the correct way, I work in a special needs school. So this connect four is used more as a posting toy. It does have value used as this as it helps fine and gross motor skills. Also develops concentration. Thanks for reading about one of my schools playground toys .

       " '5247778::::The Bunk Bed Bus - Frank Rodgers::::Books::::40::::very helpful::::01.10.2007::::    The bunk bed bus. This is a book by Frank Rodgers written in 1989. Frank Rodgers has written and illustrate over 60 books .He was born in 1944 and became an art teacher. In 1987 he resigned from teaching and devoted his career to writing and illustrating books. The bunk bed bus is a children s book suitable for children between 5 and 8 years old. I got my copy from the charity shop for a few pence. You can buy a paperback copy of this book for    3.99p from http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141315614,00.html... The country book shop has it for    3.19 http://www.countrybookshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?searchtype=author search text=Rodgers+Frank I have a hard back copy. I do not think the hard back copies are available new any more. The RRP on my hard backed book is    7.99.Right, now are you sitting comfortably?  Now I will begin to tell you about the story. Janet and Sam have a Granny full of energy. She loves to go jogging, does woodwork, and fixes cars... Sam and Janet loved their Granny. The family have a snooty next door neighbour who always looks down her nose at Granny s constructions, but Granny didn t mind her neighbour s comments,One day the children s beds finally collapse from the children doing too much bouncing on them. S Granny makes a bunk bed for the children. . The children played on the bed pretending it was a bus... Granny goes outside and gets lots of old junk: _ old wheels old bedsteads, and starts welding. Her snooty next door neighbour looks over and makes a sarky comment and tells granny that she is entering an art competition.  Granny then disappears into the shed and makes lots of noise clattering drilling and tinkering noise... Then later that day Granny emerges with her construction       .. , it s a bunk bed bus she has made a sculpture for the art show. It s a bunk bed with additions to make it look like a bus. They have to push it to the competition of course. No engine. They can not get this sculpture into the hall so it has to be judged outside. We see the neighbour looking down her nose at it; I shall not tell you if Granny wins the competition or the snooty next door neighbour.The town council buy Granny s bus and use it in the children s play park and the children and all their friends can play on it. I think this book is a fun book for the age group it is aimed at. I read it to Adrian nearly 5 and he seemed to enjoy it and like the idea of a bus made to look like a bus.The illustrations are good. Lots to talk about in the pictures. The characters faces very expressive. This hard backed book has 23 pages measuring 215mm by 196 mm.

       " '5247778::::White Mountain Tunnel, Italy::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::30.09.2007::::    The tunnel under the white mountain,/Monte Bianca /Mont Blanc .When you get to these mountains you can see why they are called the white mountains  fantastic peaks white with snow.  The picture is of the Italian enterence to the tunnel.This year we drove all the way down through France to the Alps stayed a few days in a campsite in the Alps then journeyed on by road over the mountains to Italy. We did not go through the tunnel through Mont Blanc but went the long way round the mountain it took us all day. After camping in the Aosta valley just the other side of Mont Blanc in Italy it was time to come home and we made a short cut through the tunnel. Our experience through the tunnel.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well first we had to queue about 15 minutes to get to the entrance of the tunnel a different day we had seen longer queues. So this gave us plenty of time to look at the scenery... We could see the mountain but to be honest I had seen many better views of the mountains. There were quite a lot of road works and the roads were busy.At the entrance was the pay kiosk where we paid the princely sum of euros 32. 30 for info on other vehicles and return tolls see http://www.atmb.net/atmb_tunnel.php?id_rubrique=178 lang=en.We had to wait a few moments at the peage/ toll booth so that there was a gap between the car in front of us and our car. Driving through the tunnel vehicles have to keep at least 150m gap between them. There are blue lights at intervals in the tunnel that mark out 150m. Once in the tunnel the traffic moved smoothly on the two lane dual direction road. There is a minimum speed limit of 50k per hour and a maximum speed limit of 70k per hour. There are large fines for not obeying these speeds or travelling too close.The route through the tunnel was as you might imagine not spectacular. We needed our lights on and mostly what I could see was rock wall of the edge of the tunnel those blue lights , a few  security notices the view of the back of  the car in fronts   and its rear lights, and cars going past us the other way. As we got neared the end of the tunnel it became lighter. Actually we were not in the dark for very long it us about     hour to travel through the 11.6 km /7.25 mile long tunnel. The views of the mountains coming through the tunnel into France were super. mountains covered in snow I think if we were going the other way from France into Italy the views would have been good too. Its just going into the tunnel the vista was Limited. Travelling on into France the mountain s were picture post card views passing by views of glaciers the formation of which was fascinating. This certainly was the easy way from Italy into France. My husband said he did not find the driving stress full if we have to travel either to Italy from France or from Italy to France again we would choose this route. According to the web site it is possible to get from Calais to the tunnel in 8 to 10 hours via motorways (payeage)  It took us a little bit longer we chose to drive  not on motorways part of the journey also hubby is the only driver it took us about12 hours but that included a stop or two. All in all a good route under the White Mountain Information about the tunnel~~~~~~~~~~~After travelling through the tunnel I was interested and looked up a few factsThe tunnel burrows under Mont Blanc/ Monte Bianca the White Mountain. The tunnel links Chamonix, haute savoie France to Cormayeur Aosta valley in Italy. The tunnel is 11.6 kilometres 7.25 miles long. When the tunnel was built I think this was the longest road tunnel built. I think the shortest road route around the mountain is about 50 something K so it certainly saves a lot of mileage.  Italian firms use this route a lot for transporting their goods to northern Europe on Lorries.The tunnel was begun in 1957 completed in 1965.The tunnel is managed one half by a French company the other half by an Italian public company.I wonder if you think driving through the tunnel is safe. What if you break down? There are many safety precautions in place throughout the tunnel, telephones, bays for broken down cars to pull off. There are a team of safety officials driving through the tunnel ready to help drivers in distress. The worst thing that could happen in a tunnel like this is fire.On March 24 1999 there was a fire in the tunnel, a Belgium transport truck caught fire. This fire spread through the tunnel and 39 people died. I do remember hearing this on the news at the time. I think the biggest killer was smoke as there was not enough ventilation to clear smoke and fumes Previous to this fire there have been several smaller fires which were easily put out. The tunnel was closed for 3 years to clear and repair damage also new safety facilities installed. Now I believe the tunnel much safer to travel through.The official site for the tunnel with much more info is,http://www.atmb.net/atmb_tunnel.php?id_rubrique=209 id_article=1341 la ng=en There is also a long article in WikipediaWow if you wish to view the traffic congestion or lack of it go to http://www.tunnelmb.net/v3.0/gb/indexgb.asp  where there is a web cam to see the conditions at the tunnel entrances. Also a French or Italian weather report link is available. Information about traffic using the tunnel in the past is also available here. Would I use this tunnel again? Yes defiantly     ::::5522492:3:::5510910:4:::5633146:4:::6239669:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6467633:4:::5627049:4:::5627049:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6023250:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::6222560:4:::6242691:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6318572:4:::6318572:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6168823:4:::6484083:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5843359:4:::5811168:4:::5811168:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6288851:4:::6325121:4:::2385:4:::2385:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5373984:4:::5646482:4:::5584168:4:::5817619:4:::5817619:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::5921889:4:::6497051:4:::6497051:4:::6323918:4:::6323918:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5816422:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5020702:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5786498:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6468264:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6539421:4:::6539421:4:::5244087:4:::6320938:4:::6320938:4:::6477149:4:::6477149:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6212982:4:::6474927:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Hasbro My Little Pony Show Stable::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::28.09.2007::::    My little pony show stable.  IN 1982 Hasbro toy manufactures produced a new toy it was my little pony. Ahh my little pony was every little girls dream, oh to own a pretty pony one that had pretty hair that you could style. You could dream of winning those races with them. Take them to the beauty parlour. Put the baby pony in its nappy. These ponies were really played with like a doll more than as an animal. My daughter aged about 5 when they first came out. It was not long before she entered the dream play world of my little pony. I was in the loft last week hunting out children s toys we stored from my daughters childhood playdays to give my grand children.The first my little pony was made in    1982.  The show stable produced in 1983 my daughter a sweet 5 year old loved pretty things. I can not remember if the My little pony was a birthday or Christmas present and I am sorry I can not remember the price  I seem to remember we as young parents thought it quite expensive . You can buy second hand my little pony show stable from between    5 and    10 on eBay.  My little pony is suitable for children aged 3 and over.My little pony stable was our choice to give our daughter as we thought that a stable would give her some play scenes for imagining the ponies in their stables and tending them. Also we thought it an ideal toy to house the many ponies and accessories she was beginning to collect, help keep them tidy and together. I suppose you could equate the my little pony show stable with a dolls house. Now come on get down with me and explore the show stable I got out of the attic most of the original pieces are still here. Let s fit the white stable together its quite easy. You fix the 4 stable doors on, they just click on. These now open easily so you can play with the ponies.  On the front of the building is the little pony logo a rainbow with show stable written underneath. My daughters stable has a few other stickers on too, I am not sure if these came with the show stable, she may have got them separately. The floor of the stable is blue. The roof of the stables is a light purple colour this lifts up off the stable. There is a hidden handle on the roof this makes for easy carrying. The roof also has a removable weather vein; this is a yellow pony with an arrow.There are also 3 places where you can fit in 3 flags. 4 flags come with the stable. There is a position you can fix the spare flag on the ponies saddle. These flags have pony symbols from the decoration on the individual ponies. The fully assembled show stable is a cube about 30cm sq.Inside the stableThere is a free standing white bed with a purple head board this came with a pretty pink blanket.There are hooks on the doors at the back of the stable from these the little ponies could hang the first second and third ribbons that they won (the ribbons came with the stable.) Three yellow trophy cups also came with the stable. There are two green window shelves to fit onto the windows and 2 green troughs to put outside the show stableAlso with the show stable came Lemon drop. A pretty yellow pony with purple mane and tail, purple eyes too. She has purple raindrops on her hind quarters. My daughter spent ages grooming her with the purple comb and yellow heart shaped brush that came with the stable tying the pony tail with the ribbon that also came with the set... Lemon drops mane and tail could be plaited  and coiffed for hours.Lemon drop has a pink saddle with a rope design on it and lots of flowers, reins and bridleA little plastic light brown puppy called Brandy was there in the stable to add to the fun. Now my little pony had been groomed ready for the races. A race course could be set up with the two white A style jumps and the pole jump (white with yellow pole). There were 6 green plastic fences. Lemon drop and the other ponies my daughter owned had great fun racing and jumping. Winning the trophies. My daughter and her friends did play with this My little pony stable quite a lot. The stable is quite easy to carry from room to room by its handle and it is also a good toy to take to amuse your child at a relative as it is compact and you can carry the little pony paraphernalia inside the stable.I have just looked and discovered the  web site http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_GB/default.cfm?page=Products/Catalog.  You can buy my little ponies from Argos too see their selection and prices at http://www.argos.co.uk /webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?

       " \"5247778::::Sainsbury's Eccles Cakes::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::26.09.2007::::    Eccles cakes.~~~~~ I was thinking about the history behind little some of our traditional cakes and thought I would tell you about Eccles cakes.I have often purchased these traditional cakes in many bakers all over England. Eccles cakes are named after the market town of Eccles in Salford near Manchester. History.~~~~~~~~I have researched a little and discovered no one heard of this cake before 1785 when  James Birch  had a bakers shop  it is not sure when the first Eccles cake was sold there but it was sometime  between 1785 and 1800.It is suspected that the recipe for  sweet patties  that is in the cookery book, the experienced housekeeper written by: Mrs Elizabeth Raffald s   of Cheshire in 1759 is where the original recipe came from You ve never had an Eccles cake  Well let me tell you what they are. ~~~~~~~~~~~ An Eccles cake is a small round cake somewhere between 5 and 8cm diameter made of puff pastry these cakes can also be made with flaky pastry. This is essentially one circle of puff pasty with a mixture of currant s mixed spices or either cinnamon or nutmeg. Some butter and some orange or mixed peel.

       " '5247778::::Cypress::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::24.09.2007::::    Cypress There are many species in the tree genus Cypress. This tree is a conifer tree. Some cypress trees will grow to 100 feet and more tall. The Cypress tree you will be probably most familiar with is the Leyland cypress.  We have Mr Leyland and his nephew Mr Naylor to thank for this natural hybrid. In 1888 a Monterey Cypress was cross bred naturally with an Alaskan Cedar at Leighton Hall in England. These first hybrids were tended and propagated and now have 10000000 s of offspring throughout England Australia and America.What does a cypress tree look like?~~~~~~~~~~A cypress tree is a conical shaped tree. This tree has soft dark green to grey leaves. The leaves are called needles due to their shape. This species of conifers does not have sharp needle leaves. A cypress tree has rough bark with a few vertical crevices running along it at intervals. This tree is evergreen. The leaves on a Cypress will turn brown and drop of when they get to a few years old, this is not seasonal. Cones~~ A Cypress tree produces both male and female cones. The female cones are round; the male ones are a long cluster.Smell~~~~~The Cypress has a fairly strong smell it is warm and pungent, some people working with Cypress might need time away from the smell as it gives some a headache.~~~~~~~~~~So what use is a cypress tree?~~~~~~~~~There are several uses that you may know of. The one is a garden hedge. The Leyland Cyprus is much used for this. It makes a thick hedge a lot of gardens have these, my next door neighbour has one.   61558; A Cypress hedge makes a good wind break ,  61558; It s a good noise barrier ideal if you are on a busy road.  61558; It s a good screen to your garden if you want to be private.  61558;  Some birds like dunnocks and greenfinches will nest in a cypress hedge. Other birds will use this tree for roosting.  61558; You may use a leylandi cypress as a Christmas tree this year .Many are used to decorate our homes and offices.  61558; Cypress wood is used to make doors and floors, the wood might be used in other places in the building of a house. The Cypress contains an oil cypressine  this oil acts as a preservative and Cypress wooden items will last a long time and not rot and decay easily at  61558; The cypress is used as our last bed; they are used to make coffins.  61558;  The Egyptians used Cypress to make the sarcophagi for mummies. Cypress wood   takes ages and ages to rot. Cypress twigs are often used in the wreath for the funeral The Cypress tree is often planted in grave yards  61558; Italian harpsichords used to be made from Cypress; some guitars are also made of Cypress wood.No use~~~~~ Cypress trees are not much good for wildlife really. If you have a Leyland hedge do plant other species of tree in it to make it more interesting for wildlife. A forest made of cypress trees will not have much else growing under the trees as the canopy excludes lightGrowing a Cypress tree.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A cypress tree grows very fast. It will make a good hedge quickly. You must be prepared to prune it often or you will become unpopular with your neighbours. Cypress trees like a well watered soil. In fact some Cypress species like their roots wet and grow in and on lake edges. There are many garden centres where you can buy cypress trees.I found several on line sites  one ishttp://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ProductDetails.asp?ProductID=70037 a pack of 10 4 foot /100-110 cm tall trees for.

This book is for children ages 2 or 3 years old. I bought my copy in the local charity shop for a few pennies. You can buy it new for    8.99p.

This book was first published by Orchard books september1997.This book is a good size to read to your child this hard cover book is 22x 22.6x1cm. It has 19 pages. The pages are a v thick paper/ v thin cardAre you sitting comfortably? Good now I will begin to tell you about this story.In the first picture we see mummy bear pushing a pram up a hill towards a tree house, under another tree is Daddy bear with a news paper over his face. The newspaper is a flap of this paper / v thin card that you can lift up. Daddy bear is snoozing under his news paper there are 7 words on top of the page  quot;where oh where, is my baby bear? quot; The book continues with daddy bear looking in a tree, in the rabbit s house, in the reeds by the side of the pond, in the mole hole, behind the bushes. Each of the pages has a flap to lift and we see the appropiatte animal but no baby bear. Each double page has about 6 to 10 words on it. Eventually we see Daddy bear at home saying to mummy bear  quot;where oh where is baby bear quot;. Lift the flap of the kitchen curtains and mummy bear says look outside over there. And there is baby bear asleep in the pram under a tree. On the last page we see the family and the animals we found under the flaps in the book under the tree.

       " '5247778::::Trumpet Vine Campsis Radicans::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::17.09.2007::::    Trumpet vine, Campsis radicans (Bignoniaceae) .I do not have a trumpet vine growing in my garden, but I know someone who does. My friend has a yellow flowered trumpet vine growing vigorously up an archway. This is in full sun. The vine will also grow along the ground where there is no support and makes a good ground cover. This vine looks magnificent in a green house tooThis flower comes in a few different colours ranging from yellow through orange to red.The roots like a fertile, moist soil that drains well. The plant will shoot upwards and grow green leaves. The leaves are what are termed as pinnate this means feather like with one leaf having lots of smaller leaflets which grow opposite each other. The group of leaflets are 10 -30 cm long.The Aerial roots grow from the stems of this vine. The Arial roots help this vine cling to its support the stems wind a little too but generally the trumpet vine does need other support too. This plant does grow quickly and will soon overrun a stone wall. It flowers between June September. The flowers are trumpet like hence the name trumpet vine The flowers are quite large 3 to 8cm long they grow in clusters when they turn to seeds the seed is in capsule which is cigar shapes. The seeds when the capsule pops open are winged seeds which will blow in the wind to self set elsewhere. This plant is a hermphadite and will self fertilise.This plant is native to the southern states of America where it grows wild. It was introduced to the UK mid 1600 s This vine can grow to 4 to 6 metres tall  This flower will attract humming birds (in America) to feed from its nectar and is attractive to other insects.Do wear gloves when tending this vine as there are tiny hairs on the foliage that might irritate . Also all parts of this plant are poisonousso do not eat. You might find you are allergic to its pollen too.This plant can be invasive it is not harmed much by frost and can be pruned back a lot. In the winter apply some compost around the roots,I looked on line and you can buy trumpet vines from:-http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ ProductDetails.asp?ProductID=10749 sells this plant for    9.99http://www.jacksonsnurseries.co.uk/findplant /plantcard.aspx?CategoryID=3 ProductID=384 sells it for    3.60http://seeds.thompson-morgan.com/uk/en /product/2848/1 sells a packet of seeds for    2.49p     ::::5522492:3:::21963:3:::5244087:3:::5480196:3:::5480196:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5633146:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::11979:4:::11979:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5551468:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5646482:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6288851:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5331868:4:::5331868:4:::5793515:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6239669:4:::6242691:4:::5843359:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5784644:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5921889:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::6377088:4:::6377088:4:::5584168:4:::6026196:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6451016:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6212982:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6374904:4:::5020702:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5512615:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Woolworths Kids Play Sand::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::11.09.2007::::    I think sand and water are one of the best play mediums you can give your child. I think I could safely say all or very nearly all childcare / nursery schools have a sand pit or tray a child can access. My grandchildren spend many hours playing in their sand pit outside their backdoor its great as this area has a roof to shelter the little ones when they are playing outside with the sand. I also have a smaller sand tray at my house it lives in the conservatory where we can sit with the children. I have bought sand from Woolworths for my grand children s sand pit. Play sand is available at other outlets, but I bought a couple of bags of Woolworths play sand in the sale. This play sand comes in a10kg bag, this costs about    1.50-   2.00 a bag can not remember for sure. My local woollies had none in stock when I looked after work today. Play sand is better for your children to play with than builders sand as play sand will not stain like builders sand does. Play sand is recommended for use with children it  specially graded for children and washed .The play sand from Woolworths is not unlike the play sand from mother care the ELC or many other outlets. I bought it from woollies as it was easy for me to get and it was in the sale. Why I think sand is a good toy._________ Sand helps children develop many skills. Primarily it is a sensory experience good for using with my special children at school.  Do not just encourage young children to feel it with their hands but let them put their feet on sand feeling the rough sand and the way their feet sink into it and let the sand run over their toes. Wet the sand and let your child feel that, make a foot print.Now explore a little further. Plays with dry sand first sieve it pour it see how the sand runs and falls. Add some water and see how it reacts differently your child can mould it into pies and castles.  Your child is exploring science, learning volume, pouring, discovering the properties of sand learning as they play. While your child is playing with the sand give them some tools to play with and your Childs hand eye co-ordination will develop. Their fine motor skills will be improved too. Any sand play toys are good in a sand pit, you can purchase a variety  buckets, spades a sieve or use an old spoon a washed out yoghurt pot. When playing with sand your child will learn about changes, the difference adding water makes. Your child will learn about causes and effects, what happened when you tap out wet sand from a bucket what happens when you knock the sand castle over. Wet sand is also good for writing letters on tracing the letters into the sand either with a finger or a tool.After the first exploratory sand play your child will learn construction making tunnels and buildings.This constructive play will soon develop into dramatic play, your child using the  digger  to build a house, to build a road., listen to your child while they are playing they are in a world of their own.Sand play is good for your Childs vocabulary too learning words like wet, dry, sift pour. Learning the words for capacity  empty, full. Please talk to your children while they are playing.Playing with sand can also develop social skills, learning to share, learning to play with each other. Yes sand is a really good play material.There are many outdoor and indoor sand trays/pits available from many different outlets or you can use and old container. Just one thing id you keep your sand pit in the garden do put a lid on it other wise it may become the neighbourhood cat loo. Now as winter draws nigh you might not think that it s good to buy sand for your child at home, but there is no reason why you can not use sand inside the house. Use a smaller container, put an old shower curtain under the sand tray and have a dustpan and brush at the ready.Hazards with sand -----Most children will try and eat sand do not worry too much as it can not do much harm will not usually hurt anyone and your child will discover it does not taste or feel nice in the mouth. Just say that was silly sand is not for eating it s for playing with, it does not taste nice does it. Sand in the eyes, yes it happens, your Childs friend may throw some sand this should be discouraged. If a little sand does get into a Childs eye tell the child not to rub they eye and  get the child to blink a lot and this should wash the sand out flush the eye by pouring clean  water over the eye this will help wash the sand away with lots of blinking.  The sand will wash to the corner of the eye gently wash it out with more water or dab it out. Keep an eye on the child after If the child continues to have sore red eyes you will need to see a doctorPlaying in sand is fun and while your child is playing they are learning. Playing is a Childs work, go on enjoy playing learning with your child in their sand pit with a bag of play sand from Woolworths it really is worth it.     ::::5351450:3:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5633146:4:::5522492:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6446991:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5244087:4:::6526351:4:::6239669:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5591704:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5203100:4:::5335750:4:::5842146:4:::5837391:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5646482:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::6202044:4:::6202044:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6242691:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6391496:4:::5921889:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5793515:4:::6553849:4:::5843359:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6325121:4:::5837129:4:::6530034:4:::6530034:4:::6461332:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::21963:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6288851:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6374904:4:::6212982:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::5584168:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5620008:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5289781:4:::5289781:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::6378505:4:::5627049:4:::5627049:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5816422:4:::6496181:4:::6496181:4:::6465359:4:::6465359:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Stockton's Wing Collection, The - Stockton's Wing::::Music::::50::::very helpful::::14.03.2007::::    I am at home with a poorly sore throat; I looked through my CD collection and discovered a Stockton s Wing collection CD. I listened to this and now am reviewing it.  This band started by playing Irish pubs and gigs and soon progressed to playing festivals and venues in England Europe and the US. I know I have seen them play somewhere but cannot remember whether it was Cambridge, Glastonbury, or maybe some other event.However the CD the Stockton wing collection is one I own and listen too occasionally. This CD has 20 tracks from  Stockton s Wing , (1978) Take a Chance (1980) and  Light in the Western Sky  (1982) albums.   It lasts 77 minutes.The tracks are:- 1} the Drops of Brandy.  This starts the CD off with a merry slip jig this lasts for 2 minutes 50.  This is a merry little jig foot tapping you could dance to this. The Banjo and fiddling is lively and cheerful. 2} Trip to London: You can imagine people skipping round the room to this tune. 3} Take a chance. This is a song featuring Maura O Connell - Backing Vocals 4} Cameron Highlands. This is a tuner that has a thoughtful air to it the music gets faster and faster in this tune making me want to tap and nod my head I am typing as I listen and my typing is getting faster and faster. 5 The concert reel / the high road to Linton. Yes it s a reel. Getting livelier and livelier  6} Walk away. You may recognise this song this was released as a single.   quot;Walk away talk away looking for someone to blame  quot;yes ok I am singing to this song 7} The Belltable This tine is a waltz named so I understand after the Belltable an art centre in Limerick which Stockton s wing used as a venue in their early days venue 8} My darling asleep / Sonny Brogans. Another foot tapping jig, I sit here, but I could be tempted to dance to this one. and wake his Darling up .9} beneath the shade quot;The answer lies here somewhere   quot;The birds  were singing around him  trees gently swaying in the breeze, as her lays under the trees quot; I often think that when I sit / lay on the grass under the trees watching wildlife and nature , a good place to meditate .. This song trips along and bursts into a gig at the end a satisfying song and tune. 10} The maid behind the bar,This is a jolly fast reel. 11 The green gates /boy in the gap. This is a fast reel; if I were dancing I could hardly keep up to the music.12 the dirt track in the sky.This is a gentle folk song about an old man on the dirt track to the sky  13the golden stud  I can hear a didgeridoo on this track I think this is because Stockton s wing were joined by Australian   Steve Cooney. This adds a haunting air to the lilt of an Irish jig to it. A few words are spoken in a point where the music drops down low. The didgeridoo certainly mixes well with the rest of the instruments Track 14 Promenade love. This is a folk song about walking along a lonely beach while thinking of lost love. Track 15 Austin Tierney s / Jenny s Chickens. This is an n Irish jig after the last song it lifts me makes me want to dance, I need a partner to twirl around my sitting room will you join me. This is a cheerful happy jig with clapping that starts part way in come on clap in time its fast I am typing like mad  (sorry I forgot you could not hear it too .) Louder more base now come on stomping up and down my living room one way back again then back again faster, faster     this is lifting my spirits oh it stops suddenly and goes into Track 16 Skidoo. Starts with a wolf howl and that didgeridoo deep and then a little jig notes making me tap my fingers a twiddly sound and the deep dark didgeridoo and bass under it  sulty sounds and clapping the tune picks up I am tapping my feet the music gets faster slower then   Track Cielle swing. A jolly swinging reel  with some lyrics  about a dance come on I want to join in swing around the room yes that s right hold my hand swing around my room and la lea with the band a little whelp now and then . That was jolly I am quite tired now clap with the CD at the end Track 18 Beautiful affair. This is another you may recognise as it was produced as a single. This is a folk song .Track 19 The Humours of Tulla / The Bucks of Oranmore. This is a short 2 minute 07 tune that gets my foot tapping  Track 20 The Chicago Set.  This is good instrumental tune to finish with Makes me want to listen to more. I am sitting listening to this CD and it makes me feel I really must get out listening to more live music. I would love to be sat in a grassy flowery field in the sun listening to music .feeling the love and pain that this music makes me feel. Yes Stockton wings music really does get to my senses. It either makes me feel happy cheerful and wants to get up and dance or makes me feel wistful and sad.  The sleeve notes on this CD seem to be quite limited . This CD is a good mix of reels jigs and folk songs the line up and instruments as far as I can make out are  Mike Hanrahan Guitar and VocalsTommy Hayes - Bodhran, Jew s Harp, Bones, SpoonsPaul Roche - Flute, Whistle, Low Whistle, Vocals.Maurice Lennon - Fiddle, Viola, VocalsKieran Hanrahan - Banjo, Mandolin, Bouzouki, Guitar, Harmonica     ::::5295459:3:::5771229:3:::6397280:3:::5480196:3:::5480196:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::11979:4:::11979:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5739985:4:::5739985:4:::5550344:4:::5285637:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5633146:4:::21963:4:::5814197:4:::5814197:4:::5719657:4:::6265235:4:::6377619:4:::6377619:4:::6404833:4:::6343765:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5510111:4:::6418036:4:::6200035:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5731546:4:::5731546:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5348537:4:::5348537:4:::6242691:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::6288851:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5620008:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5793515:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5510910:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5522492:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5782906:4:::5782906:4:::6291350:4:::6291350:4:::5687811:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::5843359:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5624912:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::6224456:4:::6319849:4:::6319849:4:::6225687:4:::5584168:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::6230813:4:::6230813:4:::5774361:4:::5774361:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::5762857:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::6163519:4:::6163519:4:::5802710:4:::5802710:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5530943:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::5720430:4:::6223486:4:::6223486:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::6044343:4:::6044343:4:::5749337:4:::5749337:4:::5842146:4:::5588010:4:::5588010:4:::5644117:4:::5644117:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::5366599:4:::5366599:4:::5414290:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::</endperson>\\n\",\n",
       " '5247778::::Grand St Bernards Pass, Italy::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::08.09.2007::::    When we were on holiday in Italy we were not very far away from the borders with Switzerland. We were near the grand St Bernard s pass, so one day we had to visit and pop into Switzerland just to look and say we had been there really. There is also a petit Saint Bernard s pass this is between France and Italy This pass in the ALPS between Switzerland and Italy had been used for many years since before 800 BC. Tribe s people and traders used this pass to take their wares for sale and Armies used this pass for their troops. Its possible Hannibal and his elephants passed this way also Julius Cesar too, Napoleon led his army of 40,000 troops over the pass into Italy in may1800,Saint Bernard of Methon~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~During the 900 s it became a treacherous place for travellers as Huns and Saracens rampaged terrorising travellers stealing and hurting them.Bernard of Menthon was the Archbishop of nearby Aosta. Bernard travelled the area spreading the word of god He tended the victim s injuries and was the overseer of the construction of a hospice on the pass. This hospice was a welcome refuge for travellers giving pilgrims free shelter and food. In 1923 he was given the title patron saint of the Alps by Pope Pius XI. I am not sure when the pass took his name.St Bernard dogs~~~~~~~~~~The Saint Bernard dog is named after Bernard of Methon. The dog has been kept and bred at the St Bernard pass since the C17. At first maybe used as a guard dog, and then its aptitude for sensing avalanches and rescuing people buried in the snow. The Brandy cask is I am afraid a romantic addition painted in an 1820 painting by Sir Edwin Landseer in 1820. I think that St Bernard s dogs are still bred by monks at the hospice now ,although I am not sure, we certainly saw none on the mountainside.Our journey to the pass~~~~~~~~We left Aosta and taking the road ss20 marked Saint Bernard s pass. We passed through and by several small villages/small towns we stopped at one and I bought some bread and ham for lunch.There is a quick way to Switzerland a tunnel goes through the mountain. There is a toll. The pass now is mostly used by tourist trafficThe road we were traversing is closed from October till June due to the snow making it impassable.When we were travelling along this road it was quite busy there were some roadworks. The scenery was terrific the mountains giving it that wow factorWe spotted the Saint Bernard s hospice and the custom point just above the lac between the mountain peaks Mont Mort and Pic de Drona The border pass~~~~~~~~~The height of the pass at the border is 2469 m. We did not stop at first because it looked too crowded. We passed through the customs passports ready, we did not need to show them. Into Switzerland and back again~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We then continued a little way in to Switzerland. (I wanted to tell everyone I have been there.) We only traveled couple of miles if that and stoppedby the side of the road where there is a sign of Napoleons hat, we only had a short stroll here as it was snowy yes we were in the snow, not much but it was slippery. We stopped and looked at the view of another lake and the road winding down into Switzerland. We looked at the flora and found a few orchids. There were a few butterflies flying even though we were at the snow level hubby identified them, if any other butterfly nut wants to know which ones they were let me know I will ask him for his record sheet . There is a foot path/route here if we were keen we could have walked it... But instead we sat and ate our Italian bread and ham for lunch.The borders pass again~~~~~~~~~~There is a little parking along side the road which has been widened for parking bays. We found a space. No way could I go to this pass and not stopThere is now a museum telling the history of the hospice gives stories of some rescues. However it was very busy and we did not go in preferring to be outside. The hospice is in fact in buildings both sides of the road with a bridge joining themShopping ~~~~~~Hubby stood by the side of the lake in France while I just had to look in the shops. There were only 2 or it might have been 3. These shops were selling tourist knick-knacks  Surprised? I wasn t there were maps and books for sale postcards, honeys and jams. There were trinkets and toys.I found what I was looking for it was one of those little tubes with pictures of cows and sheep on it when you turn it upside down it goes baaa or moo. I really do not know what they are called can anyone help me? , I had one of these when I was a nipper given to me by my rich aunt and uncle after their holiday to Switzerland... {Now, now you young things foreign holidays were not common when I was a child 50 years ago}. I bough this as I thought my grand children would find it fun I also bought one for work for my special needs kids a cause and reaction toy, the little boy I am thinking off will love it .I did not spend too much money honest darling.We then got in the car and slowly wended our way back through the Alps and to the town of Aosta again. The road was still busy.The end of the day~~~~~~This had not been a very demanding day, hubby still unwell and although the view from the pass not spectacular the mountains views on the way up were. I am glad we did this journey. I would have liked to have looked round the museum but did not as it was busy and hubby was not keen. If you are going to either Switzerland or Italy near her I would definably recommend making the effort to go over the mountain pass     ::::6469545:3:::6469545:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5522492:4:::5633146:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5246905:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6239669:4:::5473058:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6459776:4:::6459776:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6538201:4:::3903:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::6391496:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::5591704:4:::6427757:4:::6427757:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6240242:4:::5793515:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5843359:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5596660:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6543812:4:::6506851:4:::6506851:4:::5646482:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5261772:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5584168:4:::6242691:4:::6461332:4:::6200035:4:::5837391:4:::6474927:4:::6288851:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5244087:4:::6497051:4:::6497051:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5816422:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6212982:4:::6539421:4:::6539421:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5786498:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6239059:4:::5770646:4:::5770646:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5699516:5:::5699516:5:::5664713:5:::5664713:5:::5921889:5:::6477551:5:::6477551:5:::6374904:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Tesco Bath Bun::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::05.09.2007::::    Bath bunBath buns are one of my husband s favourite treats from our local bakers. Sometimes if he has to go into the small town on a Saturday morning he comes home with a brown paper bag, inside the bag is his passion a large bath bun often there is one for me too.I know a little of the history of the bath bun. The first Bath buns being made in yes you have guessed it Bath, not the my bath but in The town of Bath Somerset There is some idea that  Dr. W. Oliver, who also made bath Oliver biscuits made these in  his bakery the 18 C. But I believe some people think otherwise.However whoever invented /created the Bath but made a slightly different bun to the bun I buy in the bakers, the original had caraway seeds on the top. / The one my hubby has a passion for has sugar on the top.I walk into my local; bakers and see the buns all lay out to tempt me. The bath buns are large plump and round (yes they will make me large plump and round too) I can see a scattering of currants and citrus peel peeping through the light golden bun crust. On top of the bun is scattered some sugar crystals glinting glistening in the sunlight. I asked the assistant for 2 the buns cost about 70p each. She put them in the paper bag.When I got home I made a cup of tea and served the buns on a plate. Some of the sugar crystals had fallen into the bag. I knocked a lot more of the sugar crystals off my bun hubby did the same? Our teeth sank into the buns. They are a good texture. You can tell they are made with yeast as there are a few air bubbles in the bun. The bun is very slightly spicy. The dough is dough that has been made with an egg added so it s very slightly cake. Mmmm this bun is tasty and satisfying, filling just a little bit sweet.  There is a reasonable amount of dried fruit in a bun. Actually I am finding this bun a bit big for my tummy so I leave some for later.I looked on the web and found some recipes I might try to make my own for a treat for my hubby.

       " '5247778::::Fontina::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::03.09.2007::::    Fontina cheese. I had some Fontina while on holiday this year .I was holidaying in the Aosta valley of the Italian Alps. This cheese is a regional speciality being made in this area since the 12th century and possibly before. There are several similar cheeses but the real Fontina has a picture of the Matterhorn Mountain stamped on the rind which is a golden brown. Fontina is now not just made in the Aosta valley in Italy, so the fontina you buy in your local supermarket may not actually come from this area . Having stayed in the Aosta valley I saw the mountain pastures with flowers growing on them butterflies and insects flying and watched the herds of cows gaily munching the fresh grasses and flowers. The mountain pastures are not near agricultural fields so there is generally an absence of pesticiodes. The cow turns this into creamy milk. This milk full of the goodness from the pastures then made into cheese. Fontina is made with full fat milk that has not being pasteurised. The cheese is matured in grottoes in the rocks for about 3 months. Fontina is technically a hard cheese that has a soft texture.  There is a rind that can be a light yellow through to a red colour.  Fontina has small holes throughout it. The colour is a light yellow straw coloured. The cheese is slightly elastic. It melts well makes a really great fondue. I melted some on toast the other day... We also ate some with a crust of bread while we were out exploring the Aosta mountainside. This cheese would make a good cheese to top a pizza with. The flavour is mild, slightly nutty. I think I get a herby hint slightly fruity and a hint of mushroom too. Guess that s due to that gorgeous mix of flora they eat in the mountain valley pastures.Goes down well at the end of the day, sat outside the tent with some bread and a glass of wine.I am sorry I can not remember how much this cost in Italy. I have bought this cheese in Tesco s England you can buy fontina on line Fontina on line at http://www.nifeislife.com/default.php?cPath=21_61 costs    3.90 for 300g, Or    5.65 for .25 kg from http://www.machiavellifood.co.uk. Thank you for reading about one of the delights of the Aosta region of Italy. I think I fancy some fontina some crusty bread and a glass of red wine f     ::::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5092632:4:::6394663:4:::6394663:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6538201:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6543812:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::5598433:4:::5598433:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5289781:4:::5289781:4:::5646482:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::21963:4:::6222560:4:::6200035:4:::6288851:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6253630:4:::6253630:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5011866:4:::5011866:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5793515:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5843359:4:::6255222:4:::5439465:4:::5439465:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5522492:4:::6202288:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5826736:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::6436251:4:::6436251:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::5244087:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5584168:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6377088:4:::6377088:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::6461332:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6241582:4:::6241582:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6374904:4:::6323918:4:::6323918:4:::6474927:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::6242691:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::5633146:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6205801:4:::6205801:4:::5921889:4:::6378505:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Zanussi-Electrolux ZRB8441W::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::30.08.2007::::    I was browsing for a product to write on and I came across a fridge freezer. Zanussi-Electrolux ZRB8441W.Zanussi is an Italian firm that has been making household appliances like cookers and fridges since 1916. Electrolux is a Swedish firm that started by making vacuum cleaners in 1912. In 1984. Electrolux bought Zanussi and is now a massive producer of all things electrical for the home.Although I do not own this product I have and do own other equipment by Electrolux and by Zanussi. I have found the other equipment good well built, reliable and long lasting.About the machine--------This is available in White. I browsed the internet I can not find the same number appliance with out the w in silver (or any other colour) This fridge freezer is H1750 x W595 x D632mm; a fair size I guess would stand in the corner of the room The doors are hinged on the right but are reversible.The annual energy consumption is Annual Energy Consumption: 339 not sure what this meant so I checked it out and found (Energy consumption is measured in Kilowatt hours per year and cost per year. Cost per year is calculated based on a rate of  0.08 per Kilowatt hour.)This fridge freezer has a A energy rating  Noise level mm the add says 38 what does that mean? I tried to find out but could not I did find that a lot of fridge s had a noise level of 37/38This machine does not have a no frost system ---so I guess that means you have to defrost the freezerFreezer---------- I can see why I would not have considered buying this model as it has a very small freezer the freezer section is at the bottom of the machine, sensible as heat rises,. It is section only 3 shelves capacity 109 litres. There are pullout draws with clear fronts essential I think and easier to have the draws if the freezer compartment is at the base of the machine as you can pull them out to tidy / add new foods /clean. The freezer star rating is 4. You can turn the freezer temperature to fast freeze top freeze your home baking more quickly. To be honest this freezer would not be big enough for me unless I maybe use it in the kitchen and have a chest freezer in the garage. Fridge  The fridge is a good size capacity 226 litres. There is a salad draw at the base of the fridge and then there are 3 safety glass shelves which can be positioned at a variety of heights. In the door there is a bottle rack for your milk. There is a tray for your eggs, 6 I think. Then there is another tray suitable for butter and stuff.There is an internal light. I think there looks a good storage space inside this fridge.Overall this sounds and looks a good fridge from a trustworthy maker. Price is---------Available from Sainsbury s for    248, its    260 at the CO-OP at Marshall ward its    299 + delivery. So it s worth looking around for the cheapest offer.     ::::5658720:1:::5658720:1:::6189264:3:::6189264:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::6239669:3:::5522492:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5515635:3:::5515635:3:::5256544:3:::5256544:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5837129:4:::6538201:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::21963:4:::6222560:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5826736:4:::6518229:4:::6518229:4:::6152305:4:::6152305:4:::6354829:4:::6354829:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6484083:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5359533:4:::5359533:4:::5793515:4:::6474998:4:::6474998:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6364981:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5620008:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5921889:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6242691:4:::6461332:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6205801:4:::6205801:4:::5693422:4:::5693422:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5646482:4:::6473590:4:::6460575:4:::6378505:4:::6434716:4:::6239059:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6451016:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " \"5247778::::Valle D'Aosta Regional Hospital::::Travel::::50::::very helpful::::23.08.2007::::    This review is about my experience with my husband at the hospital in Aosta not the valley in general .  .A website with a map of the hospital is at http://www.paginegialle.it/pg/cgi/mappe/build_map.cgi? cl=2 cc=286129140 iq=000192168415019631000001 cb=0____My impression of the Regional Hospital, Aosta, Italy~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ While we were on holiday camping in the Aosta valley in Italy my husband developed a urine infection. He suffered for 3 days in pain every time he tried to wee and on the third day he said  I am not getting any better Lets go to the hospital, I need something to stop the pain  We found the hospital very easily but there did not seem to be any parking at the hospital when we tried to park somewhere we thought was ok we got moved on there was a public car park just on the other side of the road opposite the hospital. This cost 50 cents to park for an hour.The hospital was a middle sized oldish building did not look particularly modern from the outsideWe found the right entrance for A   E; we were surprised how small the reception room was just a desk with a receptionist and about 30 chairs. When we went at about 9.30 in the morning there were about 18 people waiting. Later in the day. It got a lot busier people waiting in A E waiting room and in the corridor outsideThe receptionist had little or no English but we managed to fill out a form they had it in different languages.Hubby was accessed and given a no emergency prioritization wristband the lowest of about 5 categories from nearly dead to only just poorly. He had to show his passport and a NHS European health insurance card which he got at a u k post office.We sat and waited for about 5 minutes, hubby said I feel sick he looked as if he was about to throw up. I looked around to see if I had a plastic carrier bag handy, then I looked at him to ask if he was ok and he slumped in his chair went a deathly grey pale colour his eyes went to one side. I noticed he was still breathing ( relief) we were immediately in front of the reception desk I called  can someone help me please . The receptionist and another man helped me lay hubby on floor raised his legs. One of the other casualty patients a man with a bandaged leg spoke some English and translated a little for me .My hubby regained consciousness after a few moments and when he woke he was confused. When he was able too he was assisted to lie down on a trolley. He was wheeled into a corridor to wait I had to stand no where to sit.I think this must have speeded us up the priority waiting time. A woman who was also waiting with her husband could speak English and helped translate explained a little to us. When my husband went in to see the Doctor I went in too. It was a bit difficult as only speaking about 3 words of Italian and the lady doctor speaking only a little English we struggled with a mixture of English and French as I can speak and understand a little French better than Italian. My husband is a biologist so found it easier to use the Latin names to describe the problem. .My husband was examined and put on a drip as the Dr Thought he was dehydrated. Because it hurt to pee hubby had not been drinking much. Our DR called in another DR with better EnglishHubby was given a though examination. She felt the area around his kidneys then put her rubber gloves on and examined his penis and glands. The Doctor explained she was going to examine his rectum so hubby rolled over and she stuck a finger up. Then our DR called in another DR with better English who shook my husbands hand and introduced himself. Hubby said to me seems like they are going to tell me the worst now, as don t DR s on the telly shake your hand when they are going to give you bad news. However the other also doctor stuck his finger up my husband where the sun does not shine and they explained that they could feel small polyps which would need looking at by our own Doctor when we got home.And they thought the pain with urinating was possibly a urine infection that was causing the problem, but it could also be kidney stones or a fatal kidney problem.Hubby still on the trolley was wheeled into a corridor to wait. I stood again. Husband was given a CAT scan to eliminate the kidney stones and other kidney problem. I must admit I was scared more scared than he was I think all scenarios were going through my head. I was allowed into all the consultations with doctors with my husband not into the scan. He was put on another saline drip and pushed into the corridor near the first DR; s room another corridor to wait. This time he was moved from trolley to wheelchair. Time was pushing on it was about 2.30 pm now. There was a new doctor shifts had changed. We waited about another hour while hubbys drip went into his body.There was a lot of waiting about in corridors so I had time to notice the building was beginning to age looked a little shabby. Very similar condition to Stole Mandeville hospital where I sometimes go. The building not quite as modern as stoke. The general Ambiance of the hospital where we waited and was examined did not seem as clinical as Stoke. The atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Yes people were waiting a long time, (have to wait ages in Stoke too) the staff seemed efficient.All the DR S and medical staff seemed nice they were friendly and explained as well as they could. My husband was given the best care and the Doctors obviously explored all possibilities to find out what was wrong with my husband, we thought they were being over cautious and checked out all options. Now were called in to see Dr again and we were reassured that the CAT scan showed nothing. There were no kidney stones no other major problems. They thought it an infection so gave us a prescription to get at the pharmacy. I had to give my hubby an antibiotic injection in his bum (the fleshy part just below his hip) then he had tablets to take for 6 days. Hubby was also told to drink 2 litres of water a day. That was the reaon why he fainted he had not been drinking enough so please do remember how important it ios to drink 2 litres a day( not alchohol though)We go out of the hospital at about     4 -5 o clock in the late afternoonNow the painful bit we thought. Payment we had heard tales of charges in other countries hospitals, and he had used quite a lot of expensive equipment. But there was no charge as we had obviously given them the right insurance card and info. We found a pharmacist and thought the antibiotics would be expensive they cost Euros 38.00 about 30 pounds I think.Fortunately we were not due to come home for 5 days as hubby was driving us home through France we knew it would be about 12 hours and he was not fit to drive that long till then.Overall we were impressed with the care, consideration and treatment my husband receivedI looked at the website http://www.chirurgia-aosta.org/english/structure.html and find out this hospital had good equipment including a surgical robot. The Aosta hospital has facilities for diagnosing care of and rehabilitation of illnesses requiring hospital treatment.The regional hospital Aosta has a good name nationally and internationally for its work in laparoscopic surgery oncology surgery and obesity surgery also video surgery. It has state of the art equipment.The valley of Aosta is in the Alps many tourists go there some to ski. Snowboard or climb. I noticed in a lot of the skiing and climbing websites it says Aosta hospital is a few minutes away by helicopter if there is an accident.Although I did not enjoy or want to be in Aosta hospital all day with my husband. I felt the experience not as bad as it might have been elsewhere; if any staffs of the Aosta regional hospital are reading this I offer my thanks for the care and treatment we received. If you are going to this part of Italy although I would not wish you to need to visit this hospital if you do and my and my husbands experience is anything to go by you will get good care.

       " '5247778::::Spruce::::House & Garden::::40::::very helpful::::20.08.2007::::    Spruce. The Spruce family of trees is Pinaceae, The same family as the Pine and fir  tree.  To read the differences go to http://www.gardenline.usask.ca/trees/pinesprucefir.html The spruce is a coniferous evergreen tree. The spruce is a large tall tree. The leaves of the Spruce are called needles as they are narrow, rectangular and pointed looking like a needle.The spruce tree grows into a conical shape. It beards its seeds in a cone. The leaves of the Spruce are called needles as they are narrow and pointed looking like a needle there are about 35 varieties of the Spruce tree the one you will be most familiar with is the Norway spruce. Picea abies.  The one traditionally used as a Christmas tree. Just remembered went to see my dad yesterday and we had a spruce christmas tree when I was about 10 dad planted in on the village green by his house saw it yesterday and it is a magnificent specimin   its over 40 years old now , I p ut my last years  xmas tree in a container in garden last year it seems to be doing ok hope to use it this year .You can grow spruces in your garden   There are some smaller varieties  that are suitable . The wood of the spruce can be called white wood is  used in making paper and making chip board the wood is also used in fencing panels. Apparently the Wright brother   s first airplane was made of Spruce wood. Howard Hughes made a one off heavy transport plane called the spruce goose in 1947. The was a shortage of metal and the plane was made of wood not spruce but    birch wood                  This is the largest flying boat ever it has the largest wingspan and height of any aircraft ever if you want to see it is at Evergreen Aviation Museum.Spruce trees can be found in many countries where there are many managed spruce forests. A spruce forest is very dense letting in little sunshine and there is little or no ground flora. Some animals like deer and foxes like the shelter from wind and rain a spruce forest gives.  Some of the large mono culture plantations are v poor in wildlife. In recent years people are beginning to become aware of this and making forest trees more diverse also leaving clearings to entice the sun in and thus flowers and other wildlife.The spruce has cones which contain the seeds   Crossbills and tree creepers are some of the birds which will eat these seeds. Red squirrels also eat the spruce seeds  The Capercaillie can live in spruce woods; it does better in a natural wood than one managed by man. Insects live in the upper canopy of spruce trees and some inset eating birds take advantage of this.. The cones of some spruce trees can and are be used  for making Christmas decorations. A cone sprayed with fake snow , or glittered. A cone is a great shape for making animals with  it had an obvious nose just add eyes and ears makes a hedgehog , a mouse. I like to scatter a few cones around the base of my Christmas tree. . You can make great decorations from cones.   The smell of Spuce is great clean and fresh its an earthy smell. I love walking in a spruce wood for the smell, or walking into someones house at Christmas and smelling their spruce tree. A drink Spruce beer can be made from the needles and buds of a spruce tree apparently spruce contains vit C. From my reading on the web I understand  this is a drink that is made in Canada .North America and Scandinavia . Essential oil of spruce can be bought it is said to be Refreshing, invigorating, stimulating, strengthening ideal to adding to a bath to ease those exhaustion feelings.I wondered where the term  all spruced up  that means smartly dressed came from.  We thought it might be that spruce brooms were used for sweeping but no it has nothing to do with the spruce tree. All spruced up comes from the anglicised way of saying Prusse which is the French name for Prussia. Prussian troops were regarded as being smartly  dressed. Thanks for reading about Spruce.

       " '5247778::::Tesco Finest Pain aux Raisin::::Food & Drink::::50::::very helpful::::16.08.2007::::    While on holiday in France we ate several pain aux raisins. Translated pain aux raisins means bread with raisins. Pain aux raisins are a traditional French treat. They are a bit like a currant bun/ Danish pastry. Made with brioche bready dough which is rolled out like pastry. Then a sort of custard is spread over the surface .Next raisins are sprinkled over the dough add the dough rolled up like a Swiss roll. This is cut into slices then glazed and baked .  A pain aux raisin is approximately 8cm in diameter or you can get miniature ones.Pain aux raisins are a treat at any time of the day. Often served for breakfast or as a snack. I can not remember the price exactly but I think they cost just over a euro which is  between 60 and 70 p at the mo. We have visited France several times and the quality of pain aux raisins does differ from baker to baker, some the recipe obviously a little different.The boulangerie (bread shop) near our campsite at Petit Bornand in the French Alps sold some good ones.Do I play with my food .? yes . I like to eat my pain aux raisin by nibbling the edge and slowly unrolling the dough and eat it unravelling the circular  bun wheel  I  have to be carefull I do not drop the raisins. I eat chelsea buns this way too > Having got home a few days ago I though maybe I would be able to find a recipe to make some one day. I have found recipes at http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_20294,00.htm and http://www.insanitytheory.net/kitchenwench/2007/06/20/i-dont-need-no-stinkin-kitchen-aid/lhttp://www.thefreshloaf.com/recipes/painauxraisins Basically the ingredients are bread flour eggs yeast butter milk, sugar for the dough and sugar, raisins and cinnamon, a custardy pastry cream like the one in this recipe at http://bakingsheet.blogspot.com/2006/03/cooking-school-pastry-cream-and-mini.html. Some recipes just have sugar raisins and cinnamon no custard in them I think the custard centre just adds that something extra.  Thanks for reading about one of the foods I ate in France. It is possible to get pain aux raisins in some bread shops and supermarkets in England now. I am not sure that I really like all the foods of the world being easily available everywhere. I think maybe it takes away the extra excitement of meeting new foods in other countries, but on the other hand it makes different tastes available to those who do not travel. It   s a bit like Easter eggs and hot cross buns being available all year round.     ::::6609678:3:::5522492:3:::6458724:3:::6458724:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5261772:4:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6222560:4:::5809210:4:::5809210:4:::6205801:4:::6205801:4:::6462037:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6474569:4:::6239669:4:::6538201:4:::5633146:4:::6318281:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6255222:4:::5020702:4:::6425824:4:::6425824:4:::5826736:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6239059:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::6177657:4:::6177657:4:::6288851:4:::21963:4:::5473058:4:::6535294:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5646482:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5702150:4:::5702150:4:::6205856:4:::6205856:4:::5351312:4:::5351312:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6462580:4:::6462580:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5921889:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6452385:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6235056:4:::5793515:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5186837:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::5314452:4:::5314452:4:::6364981:4:::5414290:4:::5480196:4:::5480196:4:::6506577:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5244087:4:::6253630:4:::6253630:4:::5380860:4:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6413554:4:::6242691:4:::6461332:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5512615:4:::5816422:4:::6403007:4:::6403007:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::6368847:4:::6368847:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5620008:4:::6522320:4:::5831988:4:::5831988:4:::5843359:4:::5540048:4:::5540048:4:::5837391:4:::6378505:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::6202288:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Red Onions::::House & Garden::::50::::very helpful::::29.07.2007::::    Do I know my onions? Well read on and find out. (Knowing your onions  is an expression used to describe a thorough knowledge of a subject)There are many varieties that may be classed as onions in the genus Alium. Yellow onions white onions, red onions, leeks and chives too. I have written about those in another review. I realised I had not written about red onions so requested a category, Now I think I have told the world most of what I know about onions... I am going to write about red onions today. I was eating a red onion for m supper and asked hubby if had known red onions when he was a child , he replied no I had not either in fact until more recent years 15 or something maybe .I am sure they were not as available as they are today.(anyone got any info ?) The onion is I believe native to North America. The Egyptians worshipped it believing the onion symbolized eternal life. Alium cepa the sweet onion species has the red onion amongst its varieties as well as the white and yellow skinned varieties.Red onions.  In the past few years I have been using and yes growing red onions. I do not know why maybe it   s because the red onions are more attractive but the red onions seeds sets or the vegetables you buy from the supermarket are all more expensive than the yellow or white onion. Colour prejudice I call it.  Growing onions is easy a few red onion seeds grown as a spring onion in your vegetable or flower border will grow well and make super additions to a salad or to put in your lunch bag to nibble at with your cheese sandwich. You can sow these seeds anytime from February till June they take about ten weeks to mature to spring onion edible size. Sutton seeds sell red onion spring onion seeds for about    1.45 per pkt containing 180 seeds. For a main crop onion just leave the spring onion to mature or plant the onions as sets (small onions ) sets are usually more expensive Thompson Morgan red onion  sets are     139p for 250g , not sure how many onions but I bet it   s a lot less than 180. Just one thing you must remember if you are growing onions they need moisture to let them swell. (No problem this month.)The red onion is delicious it is a milder sweeter onion than the white or yellow ones. I rarely use red onions in a cooked meal. Yellow or white ones are cheaper and the red ones they lose their colour unless you add vinegar or lemon juice. I use red onions in salads or to garnish. I make a tomato and onion salad by slicing two tomatoes and 1 red onion separating the rings place them attractively on a plate. I wash some parsley flat leaved or curls and place sprigs of it on top of the tomatoes and onion.I then make a dressing, by whishing 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. I then pour this over the salad. Now I lightly salt it and grind a little black pepper over it. If you like them you could always slice some cucumber to add to this salad (I do not like cucumber) The round themed salad looks attractive,  There now I leave you with all I know about red onions (well most of it.).     ::::6554726:3:::6554726:3:::5238639:3:::5238639:3:::6495391:3:::6253630:3:::6253630:3:::5646482:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::6407063:3:::6407063:3:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::6538201:4:::6462037:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::6318281:4:::5646051:4:::5646051:4:::6288851:4:::21963:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5780729:4:::5606575:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::6217853:4:::6217853:4:::6243934:4:::6243934:4:::6445787:4:::6445787:4:::5253498:4:::5253498:4:::5620008:4:::6205856:4:::6205856:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::6397576:4:::5661865:4:::5661865:4:::5096060:4:::5096060:4:::6364981:4:::6451936:4:::6451936:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5255134:4:::5921889:4:::5926934:4:::5926934:4:::5289781:4:::5289781:4:::6465383:4:::5633146:4:::6467126:4:::6467126:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::6454218:4:::6454218:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6477551:4:::6477551:4:::6413554:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5717149:4:::6239669:4:::5501221:4:::5501221:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6242691:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6439572:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5244087:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6377088:4:::6377088:4:::5584168:4:::6225687:4:::6406069:4:::6406069:4:::5843359:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5816422:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5366599:4:::5366599:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6513601:4:::6513601:4:::5473058:4:::5522492:4:::5373984:4:::5414290:4:::6467283:4:::6471555:4:::6471555:4:::5660707:4:::5660707:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6461332:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6136900:4:::6136900:4:::5396465:4:::5396465:4:::6441813:4:::6452385:4:::6498222:4:::6379092:4:::6202288:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

All the playmobil pieces and people are compatible and a play scene can be used using pieces from the many different sets the bride will not look out of place (size wise) feeding the chickens or steering the mini excavator. Today we are playing with the mini excavator, a fairly new toy. Included in this set is a driver with his yellow safety helmet and yellow jacket. Playmobil people are 2 and    inch / 7.5 cm inch tall.  This toy is suitable for a child aged 4 and over.The figure has hands that grasp, arms that move and legs that bend. A few black plastic goods come with this set so that the excavator has something to move, I am sure your child and you will soon find other toys or household things   that need excavating too.The excavator is a yellow vehicle with 4 wheels. There is some writing printed on the side of the vehicle. It has a scoop arm that comes from the back of the vehicle. This scoop is perfect for moving goods around as it is rotating and moves freely.  The actual scoop at the end of the arm is grey Over the drivers seat is a black cage roof which is open at the front. This will protect the driver from falling masonry   This roof can be flipped open. This toy is good for enhancing imaginary play, and can be used in play therapy scenes where maybe you are having work done on your house or a new house is being built next to you. Lego bricks are a good size for scooping into the scoop.This mini excavator is good for stimulating and practicing fine and gross motor skills. Children playing with this can practice their language skills , you can add the appropriate word into their play . If playing in a group of other children this toy can assist cooperative play and social skills . Sharing taking turns. There are several other construction vehicles that you could buy to compliment this one and so build a play Mobil construction firm. If you really want to get into the role why not buy a yellow safety hat and yellow jacket to go with it >? I am sure I have seen these available in child sizes. This toy costs between    12 and    15  at various stores     ::::5522492:3:::5353630:3:::5353630:3:::5480196:3:::5480196:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6439623:4:::6518541:4:::6518541:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6318281:4:::6538201:4:::5929109:4:::5929109:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5646482:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6452385:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6378906:4:::5633146:4:::5620008:4:::6354829:4:::6354829:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::5700904:4:::5414521:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5453946:4:::5026184:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6239669:4:::6513601:4:::6513601:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::5843359:4:::5921889:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6288851:4:::6484531:4:::6484531:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5584168:4:::6204374:4:::6204374:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::5826736:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5952692:4:::5952692:4:::6498222:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::6225687:4:::6452575:4:::6452575:4:::5364984:4:::5364984:4:::6242691:4:::21963:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6255222:4:::5020702:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Bosch WAE 28162::::Household Appliances::::40::::very helpful::::27.06.2007::::    I work in a school and we have several washing machines so we can wash a variety of things swimming towels, t-shirts trousers and pants. I use the washing machine at least twice a week. One of the machines I use is a Bosch WAE 24162Bosch machines are well known as being a good make, reliable and long lasting. Come into the sluice with me while I put Johnnies t-shirt in to wash he spilt paint on it and It will stain if I do not wash it out straight away. Also I want to wash Anns swimming towel it got dropped in the mud  This washing machine is a freestanding washing machine. It is a white machine would fit in with most kitchen utility d   cor.  I open the door easily, it is a front loader put in the washing. Now I put in the washing powder. there is a drawer front left of the machine for this it has a compartment for powder /liquid for a prewash , one for the main wash and a compartment for softener .  Right now that done what programme do I use? There are 15 clothes care programmes whites, coloured, woollens, easy care, delicates short spins long spins, there is a time delay programme can not remember the other programmes. I selected the wash I wanted with the dial selector. So powder put in programme chosen, on button activated I will tell you a little more  This machine will wash 6.00 kilos/13 lb of clothes at a time do not overload it does not wash as well. It is an A rated machine with low energy consumption.  The Energy consumption is 1.02kWh / cycle. Water consumption: 45ltrs per wash.It seems to be a standard height and width it is 84.7 high.60cm wide 59c in depth. This machine seems to be fairly quiet I can hear myself talk to you.This machine has the new Aqua Plus wash system where water is entered into the drum and dispersed in a way that makes optimum water use. There is a 2 year guarantee on this machineThis machine is available from several retailers in the high street or on line for between    125 and    150 pounds check price runner for current prices. I  have to go  to teach the children now later when I go back the cycle has finished and I open the door  which will not open for a couple of minutes after wash has finished. The wash seems to have come clean, so I reckon it does a fairly good job of washing clothes. If I were to be purchasing a washing machine I would certainly consider this one.     ::::6318281:3:::5253498:3:::5253498:3:::5480196:3:::5480196:3:::6514889:3:::6514889:3:::5353630:3:::5353630:3:::6287172:3:::6287172:3:::5522492:3:::5646482:3:::5649437:3:::5649437:3:::5374295:3:::5374295:3:::5494298:3:::5494298:3:::5584168:3:::5921889:3:::5314908:3:::6456238:4:::6456238:4:::5826736:4:::6538201:4:::5926934:4:::5926934:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::5414521:4:::6513601:4:::6513601:4:::5465910:4:::5465910:4:::6451601:4:::6214573:4:::6214573:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::6498801:4:::6471555:4:::6471555:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5719657:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5687298:4:::5687298:4:::5287742:4:::5287742:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6239669:4:::6288851:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::6242691:4:::6225687:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5473058:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5335750:4:::5635494:4:::5635494:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5350804:4:::5350804:4:::5362774:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

       " '5247778::::Tewkesbury::::Travel::::50::::helpful::::23.06.2004::::    Looking for something to write about while my husband watching football I came across the Tewkesbury category. Many years ago I lived and worked and became pregnant in Tewkesbury. This town has I believed changed little since those days. Tewkesbury is a small town at the point where the rivers Avon and Severn meet. It is a long thin town sandwiched between the river and the M5. This town has many timbered buildings mostly in the high street. A Benedictine Abbey built as a monastery at the end of the 11c is the pride of the town. Since 1967 Tewkesbury has been a conservation area. So still has an air of an old townThe town has a shoe shop, a children   s clothes shop, a bicycle repair shop (while we lived there we owned a tandem and cycled the surrounding countryside.) a butchers, a chocolate shop, jewellers, a fishing tackle shop and an assortment of other useful shops. There was, still is I think an old bookshop stocking old books. I seem to remember a small shopping precinct with a Tesco   s. Several tea shops restaurants and pubs / hotels are in Tewkesbury so you wont go hungry or thirsty. There are many pretty walks along the river. Tewkesbury would be a good place to holiday it is nr Cheltenham and would be a good place to explore the Cotswolds and the Severn valley from. We lived in Tewkesbury just after we got married I working at a children   s home my husband doing his P.G.C.E. We lived in a flat in Mitton manor a beautiful building. We at that time were young poor and very much in love (still are really) My first baby Lucy was conceived in the manor sadly she only lived one day We left Tewkesbury just as my husband finished his teaching cert we only lived there about 6 or 7 months but I remember it as a beautiful town. Thanks for reading I relived some memories there  I revisited this review as I have been hearing about the floods and could imagine the high street under water. I doubt if the manor where I lived is under water as it was a way from the river as was/is the childrens home I worked in. The rivers often  gets high/ floods .It is 30 years ago since I lived here. About time to visit again and bring back some more memories  If you are intersted the site  http://www.tewkesbury.net/default.asp has  quite a lot of info.. Oh just out of interest I noted this weekend is the annual water festival . :-) where there are boating events and live music .  . Just heard Tewkesbury is completly cut off so I guess its very wet at the childrens home is and  where we lived     ::::21963:3:::5750745:3:::5750745:3:::20917:3:::20917:3:::6514889:3:::6514889:3:::5826736:3:::5708728:3:::5708728:3:::6288851:3:::6451936:3:::6451936:3:::5498542:3:::5498542:3:::5096060:3:::5096060:3:::5026044:3:::5379908:3:::5379908:3:::5370623:3:::5370623:3:::5389575:3:::5389575:3:::5326218:3:::5326218:3:::5373212:3:::5373212:3:::5186837:3:::5411733:3:::5411733:3:::5349831:3:::5349831:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::5270615:3:::5433745:3:::5433745:3:::5370096:3:::5307978:3:::5281759:3:::5281759:3:::5085331:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::5374295:3:::5374295:3:::5248345:3:::5251362:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5366673:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5240200:3:::5217966:3:::5217966:3:::5079230:3:::5079230:3:::5333903:3:::9599:3:::9599:3:::5326632:3:::5326632:3:::5377504:3:::5458103:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5458626:3:::5326039:3:::5268739:3:::5020702:3:::5015764:3:::5246698:3:::5374350:3:::5374350:3:::5080896:3:::5380038:3:::3343:3:::3343:3:::5414934:3:::5390480:3:::5390480:3:::5510096:3:::5371022:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5454586:3:::5503807:3:::5000594:3:::5000594:3:::5255630:3:::5469516:3:::6538201:4:::6189264:4:::6189264:4:::5929109:4:::5929109:4:::6467283:4:::5414521:4:::6451601:4:::6513601:4:::6513601:4:::6465383:4:::5261772:4:::5512121:4:::5365485:4:::5365485:4:::5126903:4:::5435242:4:::5435242:4:::5348537:4:::5348537:4:::5514704:4:::5514704:4:::5428126:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Goutu Cheese::::Food & Drink::::40::::very helpful::::22.07.2007::::    Goutu let me get cheesy.  I love cheeses. I have eaten the cheese Goutu when on holiday in France. We often pack a lunch to eat when we are walking in the mountains and a French bread, a piece of cheese and some fruit is our normal fare . I expect we bought our ration of Goutu at Champion, Giant or maybe a small local shop. Sorry I have just searched the internet for a price but can not find one. I think this cheese was not an expensive one much the same price as other standard cheeses in the shop. Goutu is a semi hard cheese easier to take in a rucksack than a soft one. It is a cooked cow   s cheese, a semi hard cheese one that has been pressed to make it firm. Goutu is a creamy yellow colour its texture smooth it has several small holes in it where the gas is made in the ripening process. Goutu is a bit like Swiss Emmenthal and Appenzell. It has a pleasant taste, we have had a fussy child with us on holidays that would not eat strong cheeses and this one was one she liked. It   s difficult sometimes when in a foreign country with a fussy child to find familiar tastes or ones which are not too strong and it was a relief to find a cheese she liked. We liked this cheese tooThis cheese will melt so would be fine for cheese on toast or making a fondue or an omelette. This cheese is easy to slice as it is firm and not crumbly. This cheese like others is good for children and the elderly as it contains calcium essential for bone growth. Sorry I can not find any links on the internet about this cheese that are really worth telling you about. I can find no one selling it. So I guess its to France to get a sample. We will be driving through France to Italy this summer so will try and remember to get some and find the price .   61514;     ::::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5646482:3:::5658720:3:::5658720:3:::5633146:3:::21963:3:::6307144:3:::6307144:3:::6514889:3:::6514889:3:::5353630:3:::5353630:3:::6391496:3:::6239669:3:::5955113:3:::5955113:3:::5241280:3:::5241280:3:::6368847:3:::6368847:3:::5584168:3:::5366599:3:::5366599:3:::5078938:3:::5078938:3:::6410089:3:::5522492:3:::5335750:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::6219528:3:::6538201:4:::5826736:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::6451601:4:::6513601:4:::6513601:4:::6288851:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5921889:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5719657:4:::5248572:4:::5248572:4:::5996826:4:::5953084:4:::5953084:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::6204374:4:::6204374:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6452575:4:::6452575:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::6515735:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6242691:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6225687:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::6471555:4:::6471555:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6417607:4:::6417607:4:::5020702:4:::6377088:4:::6377088:4:::6483674:4:::6483674:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6496853:4:::6496853:4:::5843359:4:::5314908:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::6498222:4:::5763498:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",

Alphabetti spaghetti was first available from Heinz in 1940 and then in 1990 Heinz decided to stop producing it. In 2005 Heinz brought back this product. I am not sure if the ingredients are the same. They looked and tasted the same to the ones I used to eat in the 1960   s. Sadly I threw the tin away after we had used it so I can not be sure. . Looking at the Heinz website it groups all the spaghetti products together. I guess the ingredients are the same whatever the shape of the spaghetti is, Heinz spaghetti is made with Durham wheat and tomato sauce they are low in fat, low in sugar, free of preservatives added colours and flavours    Apparently it was parental demand that made Heinz bring back Alphabetti spaghetti. There are 112 calories in a 200g can of alpabetti spaghetti Anyway  I opened the can for lunch and emptied the contents into a microwave dish, set the timer for 3 minutes and put some toast on to cook. The soft pasta is in a tomato sauce. Only needs reheating a few minutes. I served with toast but you could serve aphabetti spaghetti with fish fingers, burgers, sausage, and egg.Adrian enjoyed his spaghetti letters and did find a few letters of his name. Be warned shield your eyes  older more worldly wise children will try to make rude words out of the letters and snigger . Alphabetti spaghetti is easy for children to eat as it is soft, be warned though the tomato sauce can make them messy leaving pink faces and bibs, your children will probably need cleaning after eating Alphabetti spaghetti. As you child reaches the age to recognise letters he/she will enjoy making words out of their dinner of alphabetti spaghetti. So a good extra edible tool to help letter recognition. There seemed to be good mixtures of letters in the meal we had with this spaghetti.Heinz Alpabetti spaghetti costs 33p per 200g, 44p per 400g Heinz spaghetti hoops and normal spaghetti in tomato sauce cost 21p to 32p per 200g tin at tesco. So why not relive your childhood and buy some see if you can spell your name   61514;     ::::6139816:3:::6139816:3:::5687298:3:::5687298:3:::5522492:3:::5633146:3:::6463202:3:::6463202:3:::6514889:3:::6514889:3:::5452416:3:::5452416:3:::5353630:3:::5353630:3:::5646482:3:::6477551:3:::6477551:3:::5584168:3:::5708728:3:::5708728:3:::6185895:3:::6185895:3:::5092632:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::6208957:4:::6408658:4:::6136900:4:::6136900:4:::6514266:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5826736:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::6288851:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::6391496:4:::6242691:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::5699516:4:::5699516:4:::6239669:4:::5843359:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::5921889:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5350632:4:::5350632:4:::6219528:4:::6225687:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::6219029:4:::6219029:4:::5414521:4:::5368234:4:::5368234:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5633987:4:::5633987:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5480196:4:::5480196:4:::5540048:4:::5540048:4:::6409460:4:::6513741:4:::5314908:4:::21963:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::6483674:4:::6483674:4:::6318383:4:::6318383:4:::5020702:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Chad Valley Junior Pool::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::16.07.2007::::    I was in woolies buying the play balls that I intended to put into a paddling pool for my grandchildren to use as a ball pool; I was also on the look out for a pool to put them in. I spotted this colorful paddling junior pool a Chad valley product. I thought it would be good we could use it both as a pool to put the balls in or as the intended use a paddling pool. It is sale time in Woolworths  so this was reduced from    12.99 to    9.99. I thought that a fair price to pay for a paddling pool so I bought it there and then. I f you order it on line there is a 4.99 delivery charge. Website address below:http://www.woolworths.co.uk/web/jsp/fredhopper/index.jsp?op=searchChad valley have been making toys since 1860. Originally the factory in the valley of the river Chad. This brand is now Woolworth   s toy brand.This pool is a blow up one; it takes a lot of puff so a pump is a better way of blowing it up. However I had no pump available when I got it home so I huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed some more till I was deflated and totally out of breath. The pool is about 145 cm in diameter, 33cm in depth when inflated.The junior pool is a seasonal sea blue. It has pictures of sea animals on it, fish some larger than others it has, octopuses crabs these are bright and attractive with big eyes.Ok so inflated I filled (well enough for what I needed) the pool with balls I used 4 bags of 100 play balls, This pool is really for outdoor use you could use it inside if you had enough room and you did not mind a wet floor When I use this pool I put a blanket under it as I think that this will stop the PVC floor from getting a puncture from a stray stone or stick which might get left on the lawn. There is quite a large plug whole and attached plug in the base of the pool.I could have filled it with water it is a good depth for toddlers to paddle in this pool is suitable for children of 3 +. But I am sure many under that age will use it I can see much fun being ha by children in this pool I think it is large enough for 3 little ones to play in together.A safety guide NEVER , NEVER leave your toddlers in the pool unsupervised take everything you need into the garden with you when you set it up you coffee and cakes the treats for the kids your sun cream a child can have an accident and drown in moments .Water is a great experience children love it and while they are playing in the pool they are learning Put some toys in they will learn simple science. Floating sinking cups bottles any pots and do put an old washing up bottle in for them to squirt each other and .you       ..They will also practice and perfect motor skills kicking splashing pouring and learning how to squirt water at you with that old washing up bottle.I would recommend that at least you have a dry towel ready to hand .To make it fun why not adds bath bubbles one day. I assure you playing in this paddling pool will give many hours of fun, but remember keep your children safe supervise at ALL times     ::::6538201:3:::6514889:3:::6514889:3:::5646482:3:::5602693:3:::5602693:3:::5255275:3:::5255275:3:::5522492:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5826736:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::21963:4:::5020702:4:::5186837:4:::5719657:4:::6498656:4:::6498656:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::6219528:4:::6239669:4:::6441813:4:::5255134:4:::5633146:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::5657574:4:::5657574:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6242691:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5317988:4:::5317988:4:::6391496:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::5475218:4:::5475218:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5757778:4:::5757778:4:::5843359:4:::6288851:4:::6462037:4:::6471555:4:::6471555:4:::5620008:4:::5714219:4:::5714219:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5921889:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::6461332:4:::6471685:4:::6471685:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::6255222:4:::6225687:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5584168:4:::6204374:4:::6204374:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::6483674:4:::6483674:4:::5457044:4:::5457044:4:::5803721:4:::6260598:4:::6260598:4:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
       " '5247778::::Chad Valley 100 Play Balls::::Family::::50::::very helpful::::20.06.2007::::    Balls lots of balls, I bought 4 of these bags of playbills each bag contains 100 balls. I have for several; weeks thought I would like to buy a pool and some balls for my grandchildren to play in either at their hose or mine; daughter refused the offer so I bought some for my house. The balls I bought are CHAD VALLEY ones from Woolworths they come in zippered plastic PVC carry bag containing 100 of balls. I bought 4 bags each bag cost me    4.99 each normal price    6.99 they are on sale at the mo. I noticed in the early learning shop nearby 100 balls cost    10 no doubt they may be better quality but for my use I think the woollies balls will be fine... I also bought a Chad valley junior blow up pool to put them in. Let me describe the balls. These are PVC balls, each measuring 65mm diameter. It says they are brightly coloured well I have seen brighter coloured balls for a ball pool but these are more muted a colour in each bag is a mixture of red, green, yellow or blue. These balls are soft and squeezable they have a smooth surface. There is a seam around the middle where I think the two halves have been joined in the factory. I noticed this because I felt it as my blind pupil might.Use of these balls.The primary reason that I bought these pools was to use in a pool for my grandchildren   s sensory play. These balls can also be used for other ball games, skittles, and catch. They atre4 soft and light so will not hurt if they hit a child when balls thrown about. Ball pools are found in many play centres small pools for a class room at a nursery and large ones at sports centres/ tumble gyms. I work in a special needs school and we have a ball pit we use to stimulate our special needs children   s senses. These balls are ideal for sensory exploration by a child with visual impairment. Touch and tactile exploration are a way a visually impaired child will learn. They will learn by tasting, (all children /babies learn a lot by putting things in their mouths). By feeling  what is it like to sit or stand on , have a ball roll along your arm or put on your head a child will learn what will happen if they push or brush against an item that feel like this they will learn what is safe . A child will learn about what happens to the balls as they move their body, wriggle and you sink into the balls deeper. All children learn by experience. Playing in a ball pool will help develop physical coordination. Playing games or just sitting in a ball pool will help their visual skills fixing and following a ball as it moves; Hand eye co-ordination will develop and be practiced. . Learning cause and effect what will happen if?Looking at and touching the balls will help develop eye-hand co-ordination As well as stimulating the senses sitting in a ball pit can be calming, there   s something about touch that is reassuring and comforting. For a hyper energetic child play some gentle music to them while they are sitting in the ball pool. A ball pool is therapeutic a safe environment. If you wish to you can add different textured objects to the ball pool for your child to find , fur fabric or different textured balls. These fun balls from Woolworths would be good for filling a poll with to make it into a ball pool a cheap paddling pool would be perfect (that   s what I bought for my grandchildren)As well as using these balls to fill a ball pool why not put them on the trampoline and let your children bounce them up and down, or put them on a parachute and let your group of children toss the balls up in the air. Of course these balls can be used for more traditional games they are soft so do not hurt much when thrown to a child and it hits them. These balls can be used for rolling ball games too. Play a game throwing them into a net or a bucket practicing aiming for ball games . This is a fun way to tidy them up at the end of the play session as with so many balls it   s a bit tedious for the adult to tidy them all away. The age in the spcefic criteria is not really relevent to this toy .as this is suitable for a young baby who can supporthim/herself/ with adult supervision to a much older child(talking about them used in ball pool really ) if not used in a ball pool these balls are suitable to play with at any age . Oh go on do have fun sit and experience sitting in a pool filled with these balls.     ::::6538201:3:::6514889:4:::6514889:4:::6516378:4:::6516378:4:::21963:4:::5020702:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5353630:4:::5353630:4:::5276607:4:::5276607:4:::6208957:4:::5687298:4:::5687298:4:::5658720:4:::5658720:4:::5633146:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::6292861:4:::5370623:4:::5370623:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::6239669:4:::5657574:4:::5657574:4:::5664713:4:::5664713:4:::5522492:4:::5809967:4:::5809967:4:::5620008:4:::6410089:4:::6472987:4:::6208945:4:::6208945:4:::6288851:4:::5254109:4:::5254109:4:::5494298:4:::5494298:4:::5473058:4:::5678412:4:::5678412:4:::6460689:4:::5515635:4:::5515635:4:::6452385:4:::5411733:4:::5411733:4:::6307144:4:::6307144:4:::6354829:4:::6354829:4:::5691592:4:::5691592:4:::6462689:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5347743:4:::5000330:4:::5000330:4:::6248179:4:::6248179:4:::6238803:4:::5719657:4:::5793515:4:::6205801:4:::6205801:4:::5520266:4:::5520266:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5255134:4:::5186837:4:::6287172:4:::6287172:4:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5826736:4:::5415714:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5452416:4:::5452416:4:::5374295:4:::5374295:4:::6391496:4:::6242691:4:::6231301:4:::6231301:4:::6440307:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::5792843:4:::5821202:4:::5821202:4:::5955113:4:::5955113:4:::5750745:4:::5750745:4:::6241857:4:::6241857:4:::5708728:4:::5708728:4:::5584168:4:::6225687:4:::6265842:4:::6265842:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5816422:4:::5921889:4:::6185895:4:::6185895:4:::5843359:4:::5687422:4:::5687422:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::5435149:4:::5435149:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::6219528:4:::6390594:4:::6390594:4:::6415414:4:::6415414:4:::5373984:4:::5399986:4:::5399986:4:::6443355:4:::6443355:4:::6464355:4:::5085346:4:::5085346:4:::5646482:4:::5996826:5:::6255222:5:::5285637:5:::</endperson>\\n',\n",
